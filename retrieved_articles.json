            "title": "Association between socioeconomic position and lung cancer incidence in 16 countries: a prospective cohort consortium study.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported higher lung cancer incidence among groups with lower socioeconomic position (SEP). However, it is not known how this difference in lung cancer incidence between SEP groups varies across different geographical settings. Furthermore, most prior studies that assessed the association between SEP and lung cancer incidence were conducted without detailed adjustment for smoking. Therefore, we aimed to assess this relationship across world regions.\nMETHODS: In this international prospective cohort consortium study, we used data from the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3), which includes 20 prospective population cohorts from 16 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Participants were enrolled between 1985 and 2010 and followed for cancer outcomes using registry linkages and/or active follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between educational level (our primary measure of SEP, in 4 categories) and incident lung cancer using Cox proportional hazards models separately for participants with and without a smoking history. The models were adjusted for age, sex, cohort (when multiple cohorts were included), smoking duration, cigarettes per day, and time since cessation.\nFINDINGS: Among 2,487,511 participants, 53,830 developed lung cancer during a 13.5-year median follow-up (IQR\u00a0=\u00a06.5-15.0 years). Among participants with a smoking history, higher education was associated with decreased lung cancer incidence in nearly every cohort after detailed smoking adjustment. By world region, this association was observed in North America (HR per one-category increase in education [HR<sub>trend</sub>]\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-0.89), Europe (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.88-0.91), and Asia (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86-0.96), but not in the Australian study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.95-1.09). By histological subtype, education associated most strongly with squamous cell carcinoma and more weakly with adenocarcinoma (p-heterogeneity &lt; 0.0001). Among participants who never smoked, there was no association between education and lung cancer incidence in any cohort (all p-trend &gt; 0.05), except the USA Southern Community Cohort Study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.62-0.90).\nINTERPRETATION: Based on longitudinal data from 2.5 million participants from 16 countries, our findings suggest that higher educational attainment was associated with lower lung cancer risk among participants with a smoking history, but not among participants who never smoked. Limitations of our study include that cohort participants cannot fully represent the general populations of the geographical regions included, and education was the only measure of SEP consistently available across our consortium.\nFUNDING: This study was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF), and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)."

            "abstract": "Though indoor air pollution (IAP) is associated with elevated lung cancer risk, an integrated measure is imperative to thoroughly investigate this association. The interplay between sex and IAP on lung cancer remains unclear. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2003 to 2010, with 2871 lung cancer cases and 8019 controls. Exposures and covariates information were collected via in-person interviews using a standardized questionnaire. An integrated weighted risk score (WRS), accounting for the effect sizes of each source of IAP, was introduced. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interactions between sex and IAP by tobacco smoking status were evaluated. Environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.69), poor ventilation (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.30), and coal used for cooking (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41) were associated with lung cancer. Dose-response relationships between lung cancer and WRS were observed, with p for trend less than 0.001. aOR for individuals at the highest quartile of the WRS of IAP was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.00) compared to the lowest quartile. The associations were more profound among never-smokers than ever-smokers. Females tended to be more vulnerable to IAP, and sex interacted with IAP beyond multiplicativity on the odds scale. IAP is associated with lung cancer, with a stronger impact among never-smokers. An interaction between IAP and sex was observed. These results underscore the importance of controlling IAP, especially ETS in order to reduce the risk of lung cancer."

            "title": "Decoding the complexity: mechanistic insights into comorbidities in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",
            "abstract": "The complex pathogenic relationships between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its usually associated comorbidities remain poorly understood. While evidence suggests that some comorbidities may directly influence the development or progression of IPF or vice versa, whether these associations are causal or arise independently due to shared risk factors, such as aging, smoking, lifestyle, and genetic susceptibility, is still uncertain. Some comorbidities, such as metabolic syndromes, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, precede the development of IPF. In contrast, others, like pulmonary hypertension or lung cancer, often become apparent after its onset or during its progression. These timing patterns suggest a directional relationship in their associations. The issue is further complicated by the fact that patients often have multiple comorbidities, which may interact and exacerbate one another, creating a vicious cycle. To clarify these correlations, some studies have used causal inference methods (e.g., Mendelian randomisation) and exploration of underlying mechanisms; however, these efforts have not yet generated conclusive insights. In this review, we provide a general overview of the relationship between IPF and its comorbidities, emphasizing the pathogenic mechanisms underlying each comorbidity, potential shared pathobiology with IPF, and, when available, causal insights from Mendelian randomisation studies."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While traditionally associated with older adults, early-onset lung cancer (EOLC) is rising, particularly in Asia, which accounts for 75.9% of global cases. Existing lung cancer screening guidelines primarily focus on older populations, which may result in missed opportunities for early detection in younger individuals. Given its distinct clinical characteristics, EOLC warrants dedicated research and targeted interventions.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize the lipidomic profiles specific to EOLC patients (aged 18-49\u202fyears) and develop a biomarker-based predictive model to improve risk assessment and early detection.\nMETHODS: The discovery and validation sets included 111 EOLC cases and 127 non-EOLC controls, all aged 18-49\u202fyears. Targeted lipidomics analysis, combined with logistic regression, was performed on plasma samples to identify differentially expressed lipids species. Clustering and pathway analyses were conducted to uncover and visualize the internal signatures of the identified lipids. Key lipids were refined using the LASSO-bootstrap regression method combined with the Boruta algorithm. A random forest model was subsequently employed to develop a robust prediction model for EOLC.\nRESULTS: A total of 843 lipids were identified, with 60 differentially expressed lipids detected, of which 33 were validated in the validation set. Cluster analysis revealed that passive smoking (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 0.97-12.11) and current smoking (OR: 15.65, 95% CI: 2.55-142.10) were associated with elevated lipid metabolite profiles in EOLC patients. The validated lipids were further refined using LASSO and Boruta methods, which ultimately selected 6 lipids for inclusion in a prediction model constructed with random forest. This model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.874 in the validation set.\nCONCLUSION: Our study identified lipidomic signatures associated with the risk of EOLC, offering potential translational implications for lung cancer prevention strategies."

            "title": "The inflammation burden index can predict the cardiac injury following antitumour therapy in lung cancer patients with diabetes.",
            "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diabetes, as a common metabolic disorder, further increases the risk of cardiovascular damage. Studies have shown that myocardial cells in diabetic patients are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of cancer treatments, thereby raising the risk of heart failure. Therefore, cardiovascular risk assessment in lung cancer patients with diabetes is particularly important. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) is a biomarker that reflects systemic inflammation, combining the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes. It has been shown to be a significant prognostic indicator in various cancer populations. This study aims to investigate the predictive ability of IBI and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index for cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. A single-center retrospective case-control study was conducted, including clinical data of 192 lung cancer patients with diabetes who received anti-tumor therapy from July 2018 to January 2023.Cardiac injury was assessed by measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) was calculated using the formula: IBI = (C-reactive protein [CRP] \u00d7 Neutrophils)/Lymphocytes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between clinical factors, IBI, TyG index, and cardiac injury. The clinical predictive value of these factors was further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the relationship between IBI and cardiac injury was explored using the Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) model. In the 192 patients, 101 (52.6%) developed cardiac injury during follow-up. Univariate analysis showed that age, male, hypertension, smoking, D-dimer, CKMB, IBI, TNM stage: III/IV, and Immunotherapy were significantly associated with cardiac injury (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified IBI (P\u2009=\u20090.007), age (P\u2009=\u20090.01), smoking (P\u2009<\u20090.001), CKMB (P\u2009<\u20090.001), TNM stage (P\u2009=\u20090.014), and hypertension (P\u2009=\u20090.007) as independent predictors of cardiac injury. ROC analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.722 for IBI (cut-off: 8.408), indicating good predictive value. RCS analysis showed a significant nonlinear positive correlation between IBI and cardiac injury (P\u2009=\u20090.0079), with the risk of cardiac injury increasing significantly as IBI levels rose. The TyG index was not significantly associated with cardiac injury. IBI, as a simple and accessible biomarker, can effectively predict cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. Although the TyG index did not show a significant association with cardiac injury in this study, IBI demonstrated strong predictive ability in this patient group. Future studies should further validate the use of IBI across different cancer types and evaluate its prognostic role in long-term follow-up."

NHMs have been increasingly used to inform public health policies, highlighting their utility. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize existing LC NHMs, identify their limitations, and propose a framework for future NHM development.\nMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore from their inception to October 5, 2023, for peer-reviewed, full-length articles with an LC NHM. Model characteristics, their applications, data sources used, and limitations were extracted and narratively synthesized.\nRESULTS: From 238 publications, 69 publications were included in our review, corresponding to 22 original LC NHMs and 47 model applications. The majority of the models (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 68\u00a0%) used a microsimulation approach. NHM parameters were predominately informed by cancer registries, trial and institutional data, and literature. Model quality and performance were evaluated in 8 (36 %) models. Twenty (91\u00a0%) models included at least one carcinogenesis risk factor-primarily age, sex, and smoking history. Three (14\u00a0%) LC NHMs modeled progression in never-smokers; one (5\u00a0%) addressed recurrence. Non-tobacco smoking, nodule type, and biomarker expression were not considered in existing NHMs. Based on our findings, we proposed a framework for future LC NHM development which incorporates recurrence, nodule type differentiation, biomarker expression levels, biological factors, and non-smoking-related risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: Regular updating and future research are warranted to address limitations in existing NHMs thereby ensuring relevance and accuracy of modeling approaches in the evolving LC landscape."

Cause of death was determined from death certificates. Silicosis cases were identified by re-reading x-rays of individuals remaining in the medical surveillance program or filing insurance claims for silicosis. RCS exposure was estimated for each cohort member using a job exposure matrix (JEM) based on about 8,000 historical industrial hygiene RCS measurements. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by cumulative and average exposure groups, controlling for age, sex, smoking status and employment duration. Exposure-response analyses were performed to identify possible exposure thresholds for lung cancer and silicosis risk.\nRESULTS: Total deaths increased from 1,610 (9.1%) to 4,586 (26%) over 537,129 total person-years at risk. All-cause mortality was elevated among men (SMR\u202f=\u202f1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14); however, a deficit was seen among women (SMR\u202f=\u202f0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98). No statistically significantly increased mortality was seen due to lung cancer, renal cancer, or non-malignant renal disease - conditions reportedly associated with RCS exposure. Lung cancer mortality was unrelated to RCS exposure level. However, for silicosis cases classified using International Labor Organization (ILO) categories \u22651/1 or 1/0, risk was strongly associated with estimated average exposure &gt;0.10\u202fmg/m3 and 0.15\u202fmg/m3, and cumulative exposure &gt;3.0\u202fmg/m3-years and\u202f&gt;\u202f1.0\u202fmg/m3-years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the large number (n\u202f=\u202f284) of lung cancer deaths and high historical RCS exposures, no excess risk and no relationship with exposure level were seen. However, RCS exposure was strongly associated with silicosis risk, with clear exposure thresholds. This study further confirms the lack of increased lung cancer risk at RCS levels historically prevalent in the German porcelain industry and that exposures exceeding estimated thresholds clearly increased silicosis risk. Occupational exposure levels in the German porcelain industry in recent decades have remained well below these thresholds; therefore, few additional silicosis cases are expected."

Policies can influence the health of stigmatized and non-stigmatized populations. We examined associations of sexual orientation-related state policy environments (i.e., laws that protect or harm SM populations, with harmful laws representing structural-level sexual stigma) with cigarette smoking and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening disparities among SM and straight adults.\nMETHODS: We combined 2017-2023 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n=560,833 adults aged \u226518 years) and the Movement Advancement Project. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations of sexual orientation and sexual orientation-related state policy environment with current cigarette smoking, smoking history, eligibility for, and utilization of LDCT lung screening, adjusting for potential confounders.\nRESULTS: SM adults had increased odds of current cigarette smoking (AOR range=1.32-1.33, p<0.001), lifetime smoking \u2265100 cigarettes (AOR range=1.28-1.33, p<0.001), and LDCT lung screening eligibility (AOR range=1.28-1.58, p<0.05) compared to straight adults. Living in a state with lower policy protections increased the odds of current cigarette smoking (AOR range=1.16-1.32, p<0.001), lifetime smoking \u2265100 cigarettes (AOR range=1.10-1.11, p<0.01), \u226520 smoking pack years (AOR range=1.15-1.40, p<0.01), and LDCT screening eligibility (AOR range=1.15-1.26, p<0.05) compared to living in a state with high policy protections.\nCONCLUSION: SM adults have increased odds for smoking and LDCT lung screening eligibility relative to straight adults. Structural-level sexual stigma negatively influences smoking and lung health among SM and straight adults.\nIMPLICATIONS: Despite the overall decline in cigarette smoking in the U.S., it remains disproportionately higher among sexual minority (SM) populations, making them an important sub-population for lung cancer screening. We examined the relationships between sexual orientation and sexual orientation-related state policy environments with cigarette smoking and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening outcomes among SM and straight adults. We found that SM adults have increased odds of smoking and LDCT lung cancer screening eligibility relative to straight adults. Structural stigma negatively influences smoking behavior and lung health among SM and straight adults. Preventive interventions to mitigate structural stigma are needed."

Despite the population impact, its risk factors are poorly understood owing to a dearth of larger-scale, well-characterised studies.\nMETHODS: We pooled individual-participant data from 18 prospective cohort studies comprising 91,588 never smokers (55,452 women) aged 16-102 years at study induction. Participants were linked to national death registries.\nRESULTS: A maximum of 17 years follow-up (mean 9.7) gave rise to 85 lung cancer deaths. Of the 19 potential determinants captured at baseline, only being older age (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval per 10 year increase: 2.45; 2.11, 2.85), male (2.25; 1.46, 3.48), and having a high fruit and vegetable intake (2.29; 1.25, 4.17) were associated with elevated rates of lung cancer in this never-smoking group. No other substantial relationships were detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the number and breadth of potential risk factors featured in this multi-cohort study, there was no clear suggestion of new determinants of lung cancer in never-smokers.\nIMPACT: Our findings point to the need to explore the influence of risk factors additional to those included herein, particular in the field of genetics. Our unlikely finding for fruit and vegetable consumption warrants further testing."

A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed based on the selected variables to compare survival outcomes between the high-and low-risk groups of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma and to validate the model's performance. Subsequently, a nomogram model was established to systematically evaluate the impact of selected variables on prognosis.\nRESULTS: Data of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma from four hospitals were retrospectively collected. We enrolled 1,172 patients, this includes 372 external validation data. Multivariate analysis identified six significant variables (P &lt; 0.05): tumor TNM stage, tumor size, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, and hemoglobin level. We combined these six variables to build a model. The C-index of the training set is 0.811 (0.780-0.842), this value is 0.786 (0.737-0.835) in,test set and 0.810 (0.772-0.847) in validation set. The area under the curve (AUC) results of the predicted 3-years overall survival (OS) of the three data sets were 0.850, 0.819, and 0.860, respectively. These values for 5-years were 0.811, 0.771, and 0.849. Stratified analysis based on tumor staging showed that the model effectively distinguished outcomes (P &lt; 0.0001). High-risk groups demonstrated significantly poorer prognosis compared to low-risk groups (P &lt; 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The prognostic model based on tumor TNM stage, tumor size, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, and hemoglobin levels effectively predicted the prognosis of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Compared with the more studied blood markers at present, the indicators of our model do not need conversion, Our model provides a useful reference for personalized diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice."

Family relationships (from Multigeneration register) and diagnosed cancers (from Cancer registry) were obtained from the national registers from 1961 to 2021. The overall familial risk for LC was constant from the 1990s but the male familial risk decreased while the female familial risk doubled at the same time when female incidence doubled. The female familial risk for mother-daughter pairs was higher (SIR\u2009=\u20092.2 [2.0-2.3], N\u2009=\u2009716) than for father-son pairs (SIR\u2009=\u20091.6 [1.5-1.8], N\u2009=\u2009962). The histology-specific familial risks for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell and large cell carcinoma were highest for concordant histology but also present for discordant histology. The number of family members diagnosed with LC was a strong determinant of familial risk. The novel results showed that familial risk of LC depends on the background incidence of LC and is higher for women compared to men. We demonstrated further an increased familial risk for each of the four histological types of LC which was higher for concordant than discordant histologies but was even detected between discordant histologies suggesting that LC histology is not a genetic trait."

            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Despite recent lung cancer screening (LCS) studies proving significant mortality reduction, comorbidities are a prominent issue affecting cost effectiveness, which is holding back national implementation. Incidental findings (IFs) of comorbidities make a significant contribution to delayed diagnoses and raise discussions about optimal management plans. This is particularly relevant to national lung cancer screening (NLCS), as the high-risk population qualifying for the screening often have increased likelihood for comorbidities due to their smoking history. Methods: The Early Detection of Cancer of the Lung Scotland (ECLS) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01925625) study showcases a targeted approach to NLCS by implementing the blood-based biomarker EarlyCDT-Lung test. Firstly, this paper explored the ECLS dataset for comorbidities present within the screening population at baseline A chi-square analysis was then undertaken to investigate the relationship of cohort allocation and incidence of new comorbidities over the five-year follow-up period. Results: High prevalence conditions were cardiovascular (38.5%), neurological/psychiatric (33.9%), gastrointestinal (29.8%), and respiratory (19.2%). While 20.3% of the total patient cohort showed a newly discovered comorbidity, there was no significant variation in new incidences between the intervention and control cohort. Conclusions: When considering these results alongside the all-cause mortality reduction shown in previous analyses, they indicate that this targeted approach to LCS might help improve the benefit-harm ratio through the introduction of biomarkers. Further refining selection criteria for low-dose CT screening might contribute to minimising the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment."

This study aimed to investigate the independent and combined effects of MetS and HLF on the risk of 16 site-specific cancers in a large community-based cohort.\nMETHODS: A total of 289,557 participants in the UK Biobank were analyzed. MetS was defined using a combination of metabolic factors, while HLF scores were evaluated based on lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between MetS or HLF and cancer risk, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education level, family history of cancer, and the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.69 years, 11,190 individuals developed cancer. MetS was associated with an increased risk of 9 cancers in men and 7 cancers in women. Compared with participants with unfavorable lifestyles, regardless of metabolic status, HLF was significantly associated with decreased risk of overall cancer (without MetS: HR: 0.812; 95% CI: 0.745-0.886 for intermediate lifestyle and HR: 0.757; 95% CI: 0.669-0.855 for favorable lifestyle; with MetS: HR: 0.702; 95% CI: 0.572-0.862 for favorable lifestyle) and oesophagus, stomach, liver, lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in men and of lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in women. Our analysis demonstrated that the protective association between HLF and reduced cancer risk was confined to subgroups without MetS. Specifically, this association was observed for cancers of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, colon, rectum, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and lymphoid leukemia in men, and for overall cancer in women(HR: 0.917; 95% CI: 0.862-0.975 for intermediate lifestyle and HR: 0.875; 95% CI: 0.817-0.938 for favorable lifestyle).\nCONCLUSION: MetS elevates risks for multiple cancers, while adopting a healthy lifestyle reduces risks of oesophagus, stomach, and lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in men and lung, bronchus, trachea cancer in women, regardless of metabolic status. However, MetS counteracts lifestyle-mediated protection against specific cancers-including lip, oral cavity, pharynx, colon, rectum, pancreas, kidney, and bladder cancers in men, as well as pancreas and breast cancers in women. These findings underscore the necessity to develop metabolic status-stratified management strategies and implement proactive prevention of MetS."

The induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a typical ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), was attenuated by the knockdown (KD) of METTL3 or ALKBH5, whereas it was enhanced by the KD of FTO. As the underlying mechanisms, significantly decreased expression of AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) by the KD of METTL3 or ALKBH5, and significantly decreased expression of AHR repressor (AHRR) by the KD of FTO were demonstrated. Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements assay revealed that the KD of METTL3 or ALKBH5 resulted in the compaction of the chromatin structure of ARNT promoter, suggesting that METTL3 and ALKBH5 promote the transcription of ARNT through the rearrangement of chromatin structure. Collectively, we found that CSE treatment decreased METTL3 and METTL14 protein levels, and m6A modification have impact on the induction of CYP1A1 by modulating ARNT and AHRR expression."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between low levels of benzene exposure (\u22640.879\u00a0parts per million [ppm]-years) and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) including its anatomical subsites.\nMETHODS: Among 25,347 male workers in the Norwegian Offshore Petroleum Workers (NOPW) cohort with offshore work history (1965-1998), 455 CRC cases were diagnosed 1999-2021. We compared these with a subcohort (n\u00a0=\u00a02031) drawn from the full cohort. Work histories were linked to a previously developed industry-specific benzene job-exposure matrix (JEM). Cox regression for case-cohort analyses was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC, adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, red/processed meat intake, and physical activity.\nRESULTS: Risks of CRC increased with increasing benzene exposure. For all CRC, the HRs (95% CI) for the most exposed [quartile 4] vs. the unexposed were 1.32 (0.96 to 1.81, [0.177-0.879\u00a0ppm-years]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.085) for cumulative, 1.52 (1.11 to 2.07, [17-34 years]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.032) for duration, and 1.56 (1.15 to 2.12, [0.015-0.046\u00a0ppm]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.005) for average intensity of benzene exposure. For right-sided colon cancer, the association was most evident for exposure duration (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.25 (1.33 to 3.80), quartile 4 [17-34 years] vs. unexposed; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent associations.\nCONCLUSION: This study found positive exposure-response associations between low-level benzene exposure and CRC risk in offshore petroleum workers. These findings add to emerging evidence that benzene can be associated with solid tumours including lung and bladder, which potentially has important occupational and public health implications."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Familial risk of lung cancer (LC) is at the level of many common cancers (ca 2.0) but as cigarette smoking is the main cause of LC, it has remained undefined to what extent smoking contributes to the familial risk. We take advantage of the natural experiment of divorce. In Sweden, it has been customary that children stay with their mother after divorce. We thus hypothesize that only maternal half-siblings share the childhood environment to the same extent than full siblings.\nMETHODS: We used Swedish nation-wide data on family structures and cancers up to year 2021 to determined LC risk (standardized incidence ratio, SIR with 95% confidence intervals) in maternal and paternal half-siblings and in full siblings.\nRESULTS: Familial risk for LC in maternal half-siblings was 2.21 (1.76-2.77) which was not different from that of full siblings 2.23 (2.22-2.44). For paternal half-siblings the risk was 1.56 (1.21-2.01). For adenocarcinoma the risks were for full siblings 2.36 (2.23-2.51), for maternal half-siblings 2.55 (1.93-3.35) and for paternal half-siblings 1.33 (0.94-1.87).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results showed that familial risk for LC was equal in full siblings and in maternal half-siblings; the risks for paternal half-siblings were lower and for adenocarcinoma significantly lower than those for full siblings. The results suggest that smoking is a major contributor to familial risk of LC in this setting. Smoking starts at an early age and anti-smoking campaigns should target childhood environment for prevention of smoking initiation."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications in gastric cancer surgery significantly impact patient recovery and prognosis. These complications, including infections, can increase hospital stays and costs, and even lead to death. Numerous risk factors are involved, such as age, smoking history, and lung function. Although preventive measures exist, a unified and effective strategy is lacking. Therefore, researching and implementing effective prevention measures is crucial for improving patients' postoperative quality of life and survival rates.\nAIM: To collate and summarize the best available evidence for the prevention of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery, thereby providing a reference for the clinical development of relevant intervention strategies.\nMETHODS: A literature search was conducted in databases including BMJ Best Practice, UpToDate, JBI, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, the Ontario Nurses Registration Network, the U.S. National Clinical Practice Guidelines, and MedLine, for documents related to the prevention of pulmonary complications in gastric cancer surgery patients. The search period extended from the inception of these databases to July 25, 2024. The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Evidence-Based Health Care Center, and evidence was extracted from the included documents.\nRESULTS: A total of 27 documents were ultimately included. The extracted content encompassed three areas: preoperative assessment, risk prevention and intervention measures, totaling 31 best evidences across five categories. The findings of our study underscore the significance of comprehensive preoperative assessments, such as the ARISCAT index for pulmonary risk evaluation, and stress the importance of preoperative interventions like inspiratory muscle training, smoking cessation, and oral care in mitigating postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following gastric cancer surgery. We also advocate for the adoption of protective lung ventilation strategies during surgery and continuous pulse oximetry monitoring postoperatively, along with targeted treatments for specific complications.\nCONCLUSION: The best evidence extracted for the prevention of complications in gastric cancer surgery patients serves as a basis for evidence-based practice for the prevention of pulmonary complications in this patient group. Further research topics on pulmonary complications of gastric cancer, we recommend further optimization of preoperative assessment tools, investigation into the efficacy of smoking cessation programs, comparative studies on intraoperative ventilation strategies, development of postoperative rehabilitation programs, and research into culturally and resource-sensitive interventions to broaden the global applicability of these practices."

Among them, 1,168 had positive CT reports for pulmonary nodules, while 3,693 had negative findings. We developed a machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm and employed an improved sooty tern optimization algorithm (ISTOA) for feature selection. The significance of the selected features was evaluated through univariate analysis and multivariable logistic stepwise regression analysis. A visualization system was created to estimate the risk of developing pulmonary nodules.\nRESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified older age, smoking or passive smoking, high psychological stress within the past year, occupational exposure (e.g., air pollution at the workplace), presence of chronic lung diseases, and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels as significant risk factors for pulmonary nodules. The feature self-recognition machine learning model further highlighted age, smoking or passive smoking, high psychological stress, occupational exposure, chronic lung diseases, family history of lung cancer, decreased albumin levels, and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen as key predictors for early pulmonary nodule risk, demonstrating superior performance.\nCONCLUSION: The feature self-recognition machine learning model effectively aids in the early prediction and clinical identification of pulmonary nodule risk, facilitating timely intervention and improving patient prognosis."

This study aims to determine the most appropriate approach for nodules detected by computed tomography. A total of 526 patients, who underwent surgery for pulmonary nodules or masses and had pathological diagnoses, were included in the study. Demographic features, clinical history, and surgery-related data of the patients were assessed by a thoracic surgeon, whereas radiological features were evaluated by a radiologist. Of the patients, 147 were female and 379 were male. The mean age was 63 years (min 15, max 89), and the average lesion size was 22\u2009mm (min 4, max 116). Postoperative analysis revealed 132 benign lesions (25.1%), 380 malignant (72.2%), and 14 metastases (2.7%). Among 347 patients, the nodule size was below 30\u2009mm. Malignant nodules showed a higher median age and larger lesion size (P\u2005<\u2005.05 for both). Lesion contour, calcification, pleural tail, changes in lesion during follow-up, presence of emphysema, enlarged lymph nodes, history of malignancy, and smoking were statistically significant in determining the nature of the detected lesion. The clinical and radiological characteristics of patients can be utilized to determine the risk of malignancy in detected nodules. Even if the nodule size is small, histopathological diagnosis may be a more suitable option for high-risk patients instead of radiological follow-up."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) has been associated with both silicosis and lung cancer, but no systematic review (SR) specifically focused on exposure-response relationships has been published for these diseases.\nMETHODS: We conducted this SR in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed searches, supplemented with Web of Science and Google Scholar searches, identified 1,007 potentially relevant articles. After applying selection criteria and removing duplicates, 65 publications were reviewed and evaluated, 20 of which presented at least semi-quantitative exposure-response results for lung cancer (n\u202f=\u202f12) and/or silicosis (n\u202f=\u202f10).\nRESULTS: Cumulative RCS exposure was most commonly reported. Increasing silicosis risk with increasing cumulative RCS exposure was reported in all studies, with exposure thresholds indicated, but at different cumulative exposures. For most studies defining silicosis as International Labor Organization (ILO) score\u202f\u2265\u202f1/0, substantially increased risks were clear at or above 1\u202fmg-/m3-yr. For lung cancer, exposure-response estimates were mixed with 4 studies reporting no statistically significantly increased relative risk of lung cancer at any cumulative RCS exposure. Three studies reported statistically significant increased risks but only for high cumulative RCS exposures. Residual confounding by smoking was not explicitly discussed in most studies. One case-control study presented an exposure-response analysis for silica and lung cancer limited to never-smokers with substantial silica exposure; risk was increased only among those in the highest RCS exposure category. Studies with more detailed smoking information generally reported risks close to background levels except at the highest cumulative RCS exposure categories.\nCONCLUSION: Silicosis risk clearly and consistently was increased above cumulative exposure thresholds of roughly 1\u202fmg/m3-years across most studies. However, for lung cancer, results were heterogeneous with potential residual confounding by smoking complicating interpretation. Results suggest that lung cancer risk may not be increased at cumulative RCS exposures below the reported exposure thresholds for silicosis risk."

            "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight infants are at increased risk not only of mortality, but also of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD in later life. At the opposite end of the spectrum, high birthweight infants have increased risk of birth complications, such as shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia and obesity, and similarly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of birthweight in the UK Biobank have primarily focused on individuals within the 'normal' range and have excluded individuals with high and low birthweight (<2.5 kg or >4.5 kg). The aim of this study was to investigate genetic variation associated within the tail ends of the birthweight distribution, to: (1) see whether the genetic factors operating in these regions were different from those that explained variation in birthweight within the normal range; (2) explore the genetic correlation between extremes of birthweight and cardiometabolic disease; and (3) investigate whether analysing the full distribution of birthweight values, including the extremes, improved the ability to detect genuine loci in GWAS.\nMETHODS: We performed case-control GWAS analysis of low (&lt;2.5 kg) and high (&gt;4.5 kg) birthweight in the UK Biobank using REGENIE software (N<sub>low</sub>=20,947; N<sub>high</sub>=12,715; N<sub>controls</sub>=207,506) and conducted three continuous GWAS of birthweight, one including the full range of birthweights, one involving a truncated GWAS including only individuals with birthweights between 2.5 and 4.5 kg and a third GWAS that winsorised birthweight values &lt;2.5 kg and &gt;4.5 kg. Additionally, we performed bivariate linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between low/normal/high birthweight and cardiometabolic traits.\nRESULTS: Bivariate LD score regression analyses suggested that high birthweight had a mostly similar genetic aetiology to birthweight within the normal range (genetic correlation coefficient [r<sub>G</sub>]=0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 0.99), whereas there was more evidence for a separate set of genes underlying low birthweight (r<sub>G</sub>=-0.74, 95% CI 0.66, 0.82). Low birthweight was also significantly positively genetically correlated with most cardiometabolic traits and diseases we examined, whereas high birthweight was mostly positively genetically correlated with adiposity and anthropometric-related traits. The winsorisation strategy performed best in terms of locus detection, with the number of independent genome-wide significant associations (p&lt;5\u00d710-8) increasing from 120 genetic variants at 94 loci in the truncated GWAS to 270 genetic variants at 178 loci, including 27 variants at 25 loci that had not been identified in previous birthweight GWAS. This included a novel low-frequency missense variant in the ABCC8 gene, a gene known to be involved in congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes mellitus and MODY, that was estimated to be responsible for a 170 g increase in birthweight amongst carriers.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results underscore the importance of genetic factors in the genesis of the phenotypic correlation between birthweight and cardiometabolic traits and diseases."

Clinical series suggest impaired cardiometabolic features in UFs. We investigated potential genetic links between blood pressure (BP), several cardiometabolic traits, and UFs.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We used summary statistics of genome-wide association studies for UFs and 18 traits related to BP, obesity, lipids, and main vascular diseases. We applied linkage disequilibrium score regression to estimate genetic correlations and Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis-multitrait-based conditional and joint analysis to perform adjusted correlations. Univariate and bidirectional Mendelian randomization verified potential causal associations with UFs. We found UFs to significantly correlate with systolic BP (genetic correlation coefficient [r<sub>g</sub>]=0.08, P=8.7\u00d710-5) and diastolic BP (r<sub>g</sub>=0.12, P=8.2\u00d710-8), including after adjustment for body mass index. UFs also positively corelated with body mass index (r<sub>g</sub>=0.11, P=4.1\u00d710-4), waist-to-hip ratio (r<sub>g</sub>=0.09, P=7.3\u00d710-3), type 2 diabetes (r<sub>g</sub>=0.15, P=1.9\u00d710-5), and triglycerides (r<sub>g</sub>=0.17, P=7.6\u00d710-7). We identified a negative correlation with sex hormone-binding globulin (r<sub>g</sub>=-0.16, P=3\u00d710-4), a marker of bioavailability of sex steroids. No evidence for shared genetic basis with vascular diseases was observed, except with migraine (r<sub>g</sub>=0.08, P=5.8\u00d710-7). Mendelian randomization analyses confirmed higher body mass index to increase UF risk (beta-per-kg/m2=0.033, P=6.1\u00d710-5), as did waist-to-hip ratio (beta-per-unit=0.193, P=3.3\u00d710-5) and triglycerides (bet-per-mmol/L=0.163, P=1.9\u00d710-5). Higher sex hormone-binding globulin decreased UF risk (beta-per-nmol/L=0.005, P=2.5\u00d710-3). No causal effect was found for BP.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that UFs share substantial genetic basis with traits related to BP, obesity, diabetes, and migraine, a predominantly female vascular disease. We provide Mendelian randomization-based evidence for central obesity, visceral fat traits, and sex-steroid bioavailability as relevant risk factors for UFs."

Whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was employed to measure BMD and body composition. Multiple linear regression models assessed sexual dimorphism in BMD, adjusting for age and exploring effect modification by group and sex.\nRESULTS: A total of 325 participants were included (T1D [N=123, mean age 22.4 years, 50\u202f% male], T2D [N=72, mean age 16.2 years, 33\u202f% male], HWC [N=79, mean age 16.6 years, 41\u202f% male], and OC [N=51, mean age 13.8 years, 53\u202f% male]). Sexual dimorphism in BMD was evident only in T1D and HWC, with males having higher BMD than females (p=0.021; p<0.001, respectively). BMI was positively correlated with BMD in all groups (p<0.001 for HWC; p=0.001 for OC; p<0.001 for T1D; p=0.008 for T2D).

Our previous studies suggested that C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells promotes insulin secretion and cell survival. However, as C3aR1 is expressed on many other cell types including within the islets, whole-body C3aR1 knockout models confound the analyses of direct impacts on \u03b2 cells. To clarify the role of C3aR1 in \u03b2 cells under T2D conditions, we generated \u03b2 cell-specific C3aR1 knockout mice. We assessed glucose homeostasis, focusing on \u03b2 cell function and mass under metabolic stress conditions, to interrogate the effects of C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells in a mouse model of T2D. We performed proteomic analyses on islets from control and \u03b2 cell-specific C3aR1 knockout mice. To determine potential translational relevance, C3AR1 was assessed alongside glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets.\nRESULTS: We show that the complement receptor C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells plays an essential role in maintaining \u03b2 cell homeostasis, especially under the metabolic duress of obesity and T2D. Male mice with \u03b2 cell specific deletion of C3ar1 (\u03b2-C3aR1 KO) exhibit worse glucose tolerance and lower insulin levels when fed regular or high fat diet. Under high fat diet, \u03b2-C3aR1 KO also have diminished \u03b2 cell mass. Islets from \u03b2-C3aR1 KO mice demonstrate impaired insulin secretion. \u03b2 cells lacking C3aR1 display increased susceptibility to lipotoxicity-mediated cell death. Markers of \u03b2 cell identity are decreased in \u03b2-C3aR1 KO mice while stress markers are elevated. Disruption of C3ar1 on \u03b2 cells ablates the insulin secretory response to C3a, establishing a signaling axis between C3a and \u03b2 cell-derived C3aR1. Islet proteomic analyses highlight the MAPK pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction with C3aR1 loss in \u03b2 cells. Finally, we show that C3AR1 is positively correlated with insulin secretion in human islets.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that C3aR1 expression on \u03b2 cells is necessary to maintain optimal \u03b2 cell function and preserve \u03b2 cell mass in T2D."

Bile acids have been applied in the treatment of PCOS-related conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of bile acids on a PCOS rat model and explore the underlying mechanisms involved.\nMETHODS: Morphological index evaluation, histopathological examination, and hormonal profiling were employed to assess the therapeutic effects of eight bile acids. A targeted proteomics was utilized to characterize and quantify highly homologous chemerin isoforms in rat serum. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to identify potential targets and molecular mechanisms involved. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the affinity between bile acids and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).\nRESULTS: Five of the eight bile acids markedly restored morphological indices, histopathological manifestations, hormonal imbalances, and chemerin isoform dysregulation. Notably, the therapeutic effects of TDCA and GUDCA on PCOS were reported for the first time. As the severity of the disease decreased, chemerin-157S was negatively correlated with progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), antral follicles, and corpus luteum, respectively. Several chemerin-associated pathways have been identified via network pharmacology analysis. Additionally, a 7\u03b2-hydroxy group carried on the steroid skeleton of bile acids has been found to exhibit positive therapeutic efficacy in PCOS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Downregulating chemerin levels via specific bile acids may be a promising therapeutic strategy for PCOS patients."

In this review, we discuss the correlation between insulin resistance and NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) due to dietary fructose intake. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is spreading quickly over the world and has epidemic proportions. The risk of both hepatic and metabolic abnormalities is increased by their connection, founded on shared metabolic risk factors such as obesity, (IR) Insulin Resistance, and an unhealthy standard of living. This review highlights the prevalence of coexisting T2DM (Type 2 diabetes) and NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) in the community. In summary, the key pathophysiological pathways and risk stratification algorithms for the onset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes have been covered."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The escalating incidence of obesity and metabolic syndromes has catalyzed a critical evaluation of dietary sugars, leading to an increased interest in non-nutritive and natural sweeteners as viable alternatives. This manuscript reviews the historical developments, safety profiles, and health-related consequences of these sweeteners, tracing the evolution from early discoveries such as saccharin and cyclamate to contemporary compounds like aspartame, sucralose, and plant-derived sweeteners.\nRECENT FINDINGS: We explore the physiological mechanisms underpinning sweet taste perception, including the roles of T1R and T2R receptors, and the neurochemical pathways involving dopamine in mediating the rewarding effects of sugar consumption. The review underscores the adverse health impacts associated with excessive intake of added sugars, which correlate positively with conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Attention is given to the contrasting profiles of non-nutritive sweeteners and natural sweetener alternatives, with an emphasis on emerging concerns regarding the safety and long-term ramifications of synthetic sweeteners. The regulatory context surrounding the approval and utilization of sweeteners varies significantly across different jurisdictions, warranting careful consideration. As consumer inclination shifts towards healthier dietary choices, a nuanced understanding of the implications of sweetener selection on public health is imperative."

However, the specific mechanisms, particularly those involving non-immune cytokines, remain unclear. Here, we report significantly elevated levels of sclerostin domain-containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), showing positive correlations with fasting glucose and HbA1c. T\u00a0cell-specific Sostdc1-deficient mice exhibit resistance to age-induced adipose lipid accumulation and glucose dysregulation at 12\u00a0months and protect against obesity-induced insulin resistance without affecting proinflammatory macrophage infiltration or adipose inflammation. Mechanistically, SOSTDC1 disrupts the lipid balance in adipocytes by promoting lipogenesis and inhibiting lipolysis through the LRP5/6-\u03b2-catenin pathway. Furthermore, T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) signaling significantly amplifies SOSTDC1 secretion in CD4+ T\u00a0cells. In summary,\u00a0our study uncovers an additional mechanism by which T\u00a0cells contribute to obesity and insulin resistance, suggesting that inhibiting SOSTDC1 could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders."

According the level of VAI, subjects were divided into three groups.\nRESULTS: (1) The results showed that with the increase of VAI level, the proportion of DKD gradually increased, and there was a statistical difference (p < 0.05). With the increase of VAI levels, there is an increasing trend in males, age, WC, BMI, WHtR, WHR, VAI, LAP, ABSI, C-Index, CUN-BAE, SBP, DBP, HbA1c, FBG, PBG, UACR, TG, while HDL-C levels show a decreasing trend (p all <0.05). (2)Logistic regression showed that after adjusting age, sex, diabetic duration, smoking, drinking, BP, blood glucose and blood lipids, high level of VAI was an independent risk factor for DKD (HR=1.38, 95% CI 1.18, 1.63). (3)The model to predict the risk of DKD using anthropometric indicators, showed that the AUC of the models ranked VAI>ABSI>C-index>WHR>AVI=BRI>BMI>CUN-BAE>LAP>WHtR.(4)The predictive ability for DKD of Model 1 with VAI was higher than that of Model 2 with BMI.\nCONCLUSION: The increase of VAI is an independent predictor of DKD occurrence in patients with T2DM, which provides a certain clinical basis for preventing the development of DKD in patients with T2DM."

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between TNs and anthropometric parameters in type 2 diabetic males and females.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 747 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). All patients underwent clinical examination, thyroid ultrasound, laboratory tests, anthropometrics and body composition. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with TNs, and a simple nomogram was finally developed.\nRESULTS: In total, the incidence of TNs was 36.95% (276/747) and was significantly higher in females (52.75%) than in males (27.85%). Age was positively correlated with TNs risk in patients with T2DM (males: OR = 4.141, 95% CI [1.999-8.577], females: OR = 4.630, 95% CI [1.845-11.618]). Obesity (OR = 2.655, 95% CI [1.257-5.607]) and hyperuricemia (OR = 1.997, 95% CI [1.030-3.873]) were only associated with the risk of TNs independent of other risk factors in type 2 diabetic females, as well as other obesity factors such as weight, BMI, waist-hip ratio, percent body fat, visceral curve area, and upper arm circumference, but not in type 2 diabetic males. However, the diameter of the largest thyroid nodule was only related to age (R\u00a0=\u00a00.226, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01). Finally, the nomogram for evaluating TNs in female T2DM patients was established, and the C-index of the nomogram was 0.704 (95% CI [0.89-0.94]).\nCONCLUSION: TNs occur with a significantly higher frequency in type 2 diabetic females than in males, especially those with hyperuricemia and obesity. Modifiable metabolic factors, such as obesity and hyperuricemia, are a major focus for improving TNs risk in women."

Logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios.\nRESULTS: Exposure to 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more types of CM showed graded associations for depression, anxiety, self-harm and PTSD in adulthood. Irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia and obesity showed modest correlations. No significant associations were found between CM and ischemic heart disease (IHD), type 2 diabetes or cancer, although the ORs were in line with several previous ACE studies. When exposure to severe violence in adulthood was added to CM, odds ratios increased dramatically for mental health problems and health-related risk behaviors, suggesting that revictimization may moderate or mediate this relationship.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of studying violence exposure in a life-course perspective and suggest that the relationship between childhood adversities and long-term physical health problems in adulthood may be affected by the traumatic effects of revictimization in adult life. This points to the importance of early identification of child maltreatment and provision of robust services to protect children, treat symtoms of trauma, and enhance resilience to decrease the risk of poor health outcomes."

            "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are global health challenges that significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Advances in immunometabolism have identified Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) as a key regulator of macrophage function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation resolution. While extensively studied in neurodegenerative diseases, TREM2's role in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular health is an emerging area of research. This review explores TREM2's molecular structure and functions, emphasizing its contributions to immunometabolic regulation in obesity and T2DM. Evidence from preclinical models demonstrates that TREM2 modulates macrophage-driven inflammatory responses, lipid clearance, plaque stability, fibrosis, and myocardial remodeling. Translational findings suggest that TREM2 expression correlates with cardiometabolic outcomes, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. Key knowledge gaps include TREM2's temporal dynamics during disease progression, sex-specific effects, and interactions with recruited or resident macrophage activation in obesity and T2DM. Integrating mechanistic and translational insights is critical to harness TREM2's immunoregulatory potential for improving CVD outcomes in metabolic disorders."

            "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the association between polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and cardiometabolic diseases, leading to an improved understanding of the underlying mechanistic factors. PCOS significantly increases cardiovascular risk by predisposing individuals to various subclinical and clinical conditions, including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, it interacts synergistically with other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Several molecular mechanisms involving genetics, epigenetics, adipokine secretion, hyperandrogenemia, and hyperinsulinemia play a role in the relationship between PCOS and these comorbidities. For instance, androgen excess has been implicated in the development of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, endothelial dysfunction, and ultimately, broader cardiovascular disease. A deeper understanding of these underlying mechanisms facilitates the development of diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies directed at reducing cardiometabolic morbidity. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence, explores the potential clinical implications of these findings, and discusses emerging therapies to reduce cardiometabolic morbidity in women with PCOS."

Many chronic, inflammatory, or civilization diseases are linked to obesity, in which omentin plays a significant role. Methods: MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were searched using the keywords \"omentin\" or \"intelectin-1\". Then the most recent articles providing new perspectives on the matter and the most important studies, which revealed crucial insight, were selected to summarize the current knowledge on the role of omentin in a literature review. Results and Conclusions: The valid role of this adipokine is evident in the course of metabolic syndrome. In most cases, elevated omentin expression is correlated with the better course of diseases, including: type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atherosclerosis, or ischemic stroke, for some of which it can be a better marker than the currently used ones. However, results of omentin studies are not completely one-sided. It was proven to participate in the development of asthma and atopic dermatitis and to have different concentration dynamics in various types of tumors. All of omentin's effects and properties make it an attractive subject of research, considering still unexplored inflammation mechanisms, in which it may play an important role. Omentin was proven to prevent osteoarthritis, hepatocirrhosis, and atherosclerosis in mouse models. All of the above places omentin among potential therapeutic products, and not only as a biomarker. However, the main problems with the omentin's research state are the lack of standardization, which causes many contradictions and disagreements in this field."

While its pathophysiology and impact on pancreatic functions have been explored, the interplay between FPD, glycemic control, and exocrine dysfunction in T2DM remains inadequately defined. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of FPD, the factors affecting it, and its relationship with endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions in newly diagnosed T2DM.\nMETHODS: A total of 126 individuals were included in the study, comprising 63 newly diagnosed T2DM patients and 63 healthy controls matched for age, sex, body mass index and body fat distribution. Body composition, biochemical parameters (glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c), fecal elastase levels, and pancreatic/hepatic steatosis grades (evaluated using ultrasonography) were assessed.\nRESULTS: Newly diagnosed T2DM patients presented significantly higher hepatic steatosis grades (p\u2009=\u20090.018) and lower fecal elastase levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to controls. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was more prevalent in the T2DM group (p\u2009<\u20090,001). A positive correlation was observed between the FPD grade, hepatic steatosis grade, and hepatic fat fraction. A negative and statistically significant correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed between FPD grade and fecal elastase level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.264). HbA1c levels demonstrated a nonlinear (inverse U-shaped) relationship with FPD, peaking at 9.8% and declining thereafter, while showing a continuous negative relationship with fecal elastase levels. HbA1c predicted low fecal elastase (<\u2009200\u00a0\u03bcg/g) with a cutoff value of 7.4%. Patients with HbA1c levels\u2009>\u20099.8% presented with reduced FPD alongside persistent exocrine insufficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fatty pancreas disease is closely associated with hepatic steatosis, glycemic control, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in newly diagnosed T2DM patients. The interplay between FPD, glycemic control, and exocrine dysfunction highlights the need for comprehensive metabolic assessments in this population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic stress in daily life is a well-known trigger for various health issues. Despite advancements in obesity research, the mechanisms governing lipid metabolism in adipose tissue during cachexia remain poorly understood.\nMETHODS: A chronic restraint stress (CRS) model was used to induce significant physiological and psychological stress in mice. Mice were subjected to 6\u00a0h of restraint daily in 50 mL plastic tubes for seven consecutive days. A fasting control group was included for comparison. Post-stress assessments included behavioural tests, glucose and insulin tolerance tests and indirect calorimetry. Blood and adipose tissue samples were collected for mRNA and protein analyses.\nRESULTS: CRS induced significant psychological and physiological changes in mice, including depression-like behaviours, weight loss and reduced insulin sensitivity. Notably, CRS caused extensive adipose tissue remodelling. White adipose tissue (WAT) underwent significant 'browning' accompanied by an increase in the expression of thermogenic proteins. This counteracted the stress-induced 'whitening' of brown adipose tissue (BAT), which exhibited impaired thermogenesis and functionality, thereby maintaining energy balance systematically. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism regulation during these changes. GR expression levels were inversely correlated in BAT and WAT, but aligned with the expression patterns of thermogenic proteins across adipose tissues. These findings suggest that under chronic metabolic stress, GR mediates tissue-specific responses in adipose tissues, driving functional and phenotypic transitions in BAT and WAT to maintain energy homeostasis.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the contrasting thermogenic phenotypes of BAT and WAT under emaciation and highlights the critical role of GRs in adipose tissue remodelling during CRS and its potential as a therapeutic target. Addressing GR-mediated changes in adipose tissues may help alleviate BAT dysfunction in cachexia and promote WAT browning, enhancing metabolic stress resistance."

This study investigates their expression in jejunal muscular tissue and associations with gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with obesity, with (OB+/DM+) and without T2DM (OB+/DM-). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study includes forty-four patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass divided based on T2DM status. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire, and jejunal tissue samples were analyzed for DPP-4, NPY, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) mRNA and protein levels. Results: DPP-4, NPY, PYY, and PP gene expression in jejunal muscular tissue was similar between groups. In the OB+/DM+ group, PP protein was higher, while DPP-4 and PYY were lower compared to the OB+/DM- group. Significant positive correlations between DPP-4 and NPY, PYY, and PP were found in the OB+/DM- group, while only DPP-4 and PYY correlated in the OB+/DM+ group. Gastrointestinal symptoms in the OB+/DM- group showed positive correlations with PP (abdominal pain), DPP-4 (indigestion), and NPY (constipation). Conclusions: The study demonstrates significant differences in DPP-4, PYY, and PP protein expression between patients with obesity, with or without T2DM. Peptide correlations with gastrointestinal symptoms in non-diabetic patients suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms, warranting further research."

Cluster classification was performed using the K-means method based on age, BMI, HbA1c, HOMA2-\u03b2, HOMA2-IR, and GAD antibodies. Echocardiography and carotid ultrasound were performed within 3 months of diabetes diagnosis. Carotid ultrasound abnormalities included intimal thickening and plaque formation, while echocardiography assessed changes in cardiac structure and systolic/diastolic function. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) were used to validate our findings from a genetic perspective.\nRESULT: Carotid artery abnormalities were detected in 26.3% of patients, and echocardiography abnormalities were observed in 20.0%. Patients with severe insulin resistant diabetes (SIRD) had the highest incidence of carotid artery abnormality (40.0%). After adjusting for relevant risk factors, fasting C-peptide levels were significantly associated with a 1.247-fold increase in the risk of carotid artery abnormalities. Left atrial enlargement was more prevalent in the SIRD (16.7%) and mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) (18.5%) classifications. A high proportion of patients with SIRD had abnormal left ventricular geometry (36.1%). Increases in BMI, fasting C-peptide level and HOMA2IR were accompanied by a further increase in left atrial enlargement risk by 1.136-, 1.781- and 1.687-fold respectively. The pPS for lipodystrophy was higher in the EOD group with plaque formation, and showed a significant linear correlation with the ratio of the left atrial anteroposterior diameter to body surface area (LAAP/BSA) (R\u2009=\u20090.344, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nCONCLUSION: Heart and carotid artery abnormalities are common in patients with early-onset T2DM at the time of diagnosis. Patients with obesity and insulin resistance are at higher risk for cardiovascular abnormalities. Cluster classification based on clinical characteristics enables more accurate identification of patients at increased risk of cardiovascular complications at an early stage."

Using data from May 1 to May 31, 2020, the current study compares three states: Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. A compartmental model has been developed in order to forecast the pandemic's trajectory and devise an effective control strategy. The study then examines the dynamic progression of the pandemic by including important epidemiological factors into a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. Our method is a thorough analysis of the equilibria of the deterministic mathematical model in question. We use rigorous techniques to find these equilibrium points and then conduct a comprehensive investigation of their stability. Furthermore, an optimum control problem is applied to reduce the illness fatality, taking into account both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical intervention options as control functions. With the aid of Pontryagin's maximal principle, an objective functional has been created and solved in order to minimize the number of infected people and lower the cost of the controls. In terms of the basic reproduction number, the stability of biologically plausible equilibrium points and the qualitative behavior of the model are examined. We found that the disease transmission rate has an effect on reducing the spread of diseases after conducting sensitivity analysis with regard to the basic reproduction number. According to the findings, Tamil Nadu had the lowest reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) and Maharashtra the highest ([Formula: see text]), indicating regional differences in the efficacy of public health initiatives. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that appropriate control strategies, such as vaccination (\u039c), can successfully reduce infection levels and improve recovery rates. In our study compared to the other two states, Tamil Nadu is notable for its quick recovery and decrease in infection rates. In our findings are more dependable and applicable when mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are combined, which also helps to provide a more thorough understanding of the dynamics at work in the COVID-19 environment. This research also offers suggestions for how government agencies, health groups, and legislators can lessen the effects of COVID-19 and distribute resources as efficiently as possible .

As the number of vaccines routinely recommended for adults increases, and with limited opportunities for adults to have preventive health touchpoints with providers, adult vaccine coadministration should be considered as a routine practice to improve vaccination coverage rates and public health. A review of existing literature was conducted to examine the potential reactogenicity and impact on effectiveness when co-administering vaccines to adults.\nMETHODS: Medline was searched for research articles with the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination,\" combined with the search terms \"simultaneous,\" \"concomitant,\" \"concurrent,\" and \"combination.\" Another search of Medline was conducted on the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination\" combined with the following individual search terms: \"RSV,\" \"COVID,\" and \"Tdap.\" The references of extracted articles were also examined for potential other relevant articles.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Adult vaccine coadministration is safe for all the combinations we assessed. Most adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate and of short duration. Some studies showed slightly more reactogenicity with coadministration but few or no serious AEs or safety signals. Nearly every study confirmed that coadministration had no significant effect on immune response for either vaccine. The benefits of vaccine coadministration outweigh the risks. It increases convenience for vaccinees, reduces the number of missed opportunities to vaccinate, and contributes to efficient use of healthcare resources."

To address this, we developed an mRNA vaccine encoding the full-length spike protein of JN.1, incorporating GSAS and 2P mutations and encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The JN.1-mRNA vaccine elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, including high JN.1-specific IgG titers, cross-neutralizing antibodies, and increased T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, and T cell cytokines. Importantly, immunity persisted for up to six months and induced RBD-specific long-lived plasma cells. We also compared the immune responses induced by homologous and heterologous vaccination regimens, and our results demonstrated that the heterologous regimen-combining JN.1-mRNA with a recombinant protein vaccine (RBD<sub>JN.1</sub>-HR)-induced stronger responses. These findings highlight the JN.1-mRNA vaccine constitutes an effective prophylactic approach against JN.1-related variants, as it induces potent neutralizing antibody responses across all tested lineages. This enhanced immunogenicity is expected to significantly reduce hospitalization rates and mitigate post-COVID complications associated with JN.1 and KP.3 infections. This study emphasizes the need for timely vaccine updates and the adaptability of mRNA vaccines in addressing emerging pathogens, providing a framework for combating future infectious diseases. Collectively, these results offer critical insights for vaccine design and public health strategies in response to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."

The state of Georgia has the highest percentage of its citizens under correctional supervision in the United States. Yet, it had slow COVID vaccine uptake among jail residents, requiring prevention also using non-pharmaceutical interventions. Using a network-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model parameterized with data from the Fulton County Jail, this study investigates the impact of three SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies: vaccination, contact tracing and quarantining, and jail release to reduce jail population density.\nMETHODS: Social contact networks were simulated at two different overlapping network layers: cell and block. Cell-level contacts represented shared confined sleeping space, whereas block-level contacts represented shared socialization space. Contact tracing and quarantining were simulated at the cell-level or both cell- and block-levels, hereafter referred to as all-level. A reference scenario and nine intervention scenarios were simulated three hundred times to estimate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the outcome measures. Each scenario simulated a 185-day period to measure the prolonged effects of the interventions amid a potential COVID outbreak in the jail. The cumulative incidence, number of infections averted (NIA), and percentage of infections averted (PIA) were calculated comparing interventions against a base scenario without them. For the seven scenarios involving contact tracing and quarantining, total quarantines over the simulation and the number of quarantines per day were calculated to determine the quarantine requirements. Sensitivity analyses compared the impact of jointly varying vaccination rates and contact tracing rates.\nRESULTS: Cell-level contact tracing alone was an ineffective intervention (3.2% PIA), but its impact increased in combination with other interventions (i.e., vaccination or increased jail release rate). The other intervention strategies each produced a PIA over 10%, with the jail release scenario producing a PIA of nearly 20% despite only resulting in a 13% reduction in the jail population. The all-level contact tracing only scenario was effective at both 50% and 100% of contacts traced, but feasibility would be limited without a reduction in the jail population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementing a combination intervention approach could substantially reduce the morbidity from COVID-19 and future respiratory viruses in this jail setting while providing secondary protection to the community."

Given the need for effective strategies to reduce infection rates, disease progression, and severity, this study aimed to investigate the potential role of vitamin D (25OHD) in mitigating the severity of COVID-19.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D levels were measured using the Roche Diagnostics Vitamin D assay in 100 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, and the correlation between vitamin D levels and symptom severity was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The findings demonstrated that a significant proportion of symptomatic patients had vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL. In contrast, approximately 25% of asymptomatic patients had vitamin D levels exceeding 30 ng/mL. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant association between low vitamin D levels and increased symptom severity (p=0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation could potentially reduce the risk of severe disease. However, to confirm these findings and support these recommendations, further research, including randomized controlled trials and large-scale population studies, is necessary."

            "title": "Changing life expectancy in European countries 1990-2021: a subanalysis of causes and risk factors from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decades of steady improvements in life expectancy in Europe slowed down from around 2011, well before the COVID-19 pandemic, for reasons which remain disputed. We aimed to assess how changes in risk factors and cause-specific death rates in different European countries related to changes in life expectancy in those countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: We used data and methods from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021 to compare changes in life expectancy at birth, causes of death, and population exposure to risk factors in 16 European Economic Area countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden) and the four UK nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) for three time periods: 1990-2011, 2011-19, and 2019-21. Changes in life expectancy and causes of death were estimated with an established life expectancy cause-specific decomposition method, and compared with summary exposure values of risk factors for the major causes of death influencing life expectancy.\nFINDINGS: All countries showed mean annual improvements in life expectancy in both 1990-2011 (overall mean 0\u00b723 years [95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0\u00b723 to 0\u00b724]) and 2011-19 (overall mean 0\u00b715 years [0\u00b713 to 0\u00b716]). The rate of improvement was lower in 2011-19 than in 1990-2011 in all countries except for Norway, where the mean annual increase in life expectancy rose from 0\u00b721 years (95% UI 0\u00b720 to 0\u00b722) in 1990-2011 to 0\u00b723 years (0\u00b721 to 0\u00b726) in 2011-19 (difference of 0\u00b703 years). In other countries, the difference in mean annual improvement between these periods ranged from -0\u00b701 years in Iceland (0\u00b719 years [95% UI 0\u00b716 to 0\u00b721] vs 0\u00b718 years [0\u00b709 to 0\u00b726]), to -0\u00b718 years in England (0\u00b725 years [0\u00b724 to 0\u00b725] vs 0\u00b707 years [0\u00b706 to 0\u00b708]). In 2019-21, there was an overall decrease in mean annual life expectancy across all countries (overall mean -0\u00b718 years [95% UI -0\u00b722 to -0\u00b713]), with all countries having an absolute fall in life expectancy except for Ireland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, which showed marginal improvement in life expectancy, and Belgium, which showed no change in life expectancy. Across countries, the causes of death responsible for the largest improvements in life expectancy from 1990 to 2011 were cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. Deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of reductions in life expectancy improvements during 2011-19, and deaths from respiratory infections and other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes were responsible for the decreases in life expectancy during 2019-21. Deaths from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms in 2019 were attributable to high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, tobacco smoke, high LDL cholesterol, high BMI, occupational risks, high alcohol use, and other risks including low physical activity. Exposure to these major risk factors differed by country, with trends of increasing exposure to high BMI and decreasing exposure to tobacco smoke observed in all countries during 1990-2021.\nINTERPRETATION: The countries that best maintained improvements in life expectancy after 2011 (Norway, Iceland, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden) did so through better maintenance of reductions in mortality from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, underpinned by decreased exposures to major risks, possibly mitigated by government policies. The continued improvements in life expectancy in five countries during 2019-21 indicate that these countries were better prepared to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, countries with the greatest slowdown in life expectancy improvements after 2011 went on to have some of the largest decreases in life expectancy in 2019-21. These findings suggest that government policies that improve population health also build resilience to future shocks. Such policies include reducing population exposure to major upstream risks for cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, such as harmful diets and low physical activity, tackling the commercial determinants of poor health, and ensuring access to affordable health services.\nFUNDING: Gates Foundation."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Financial accessibility has emerged as a significant barrier to vaccine uptake following the cessation of universal public funding for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination programs. This investigation assessed the intention and determinant factors of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers in Japan in the 2024-2025 pre-season.\nMETHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted utilizing data collected from hospital staff at Okayama University Hospital, Japan, to inform the COVID-19 vaccination strategy in October 2024. The analysis evaluated demographic characteristics, vaccine intention, perceived barriers to vaccination, and maximum acceptable out-of-pocket expenditure.\nRESULTS: The study population of 3417 respondents comprised 843 medical doctors (24.7\u00a0%), 1131 nurses (33.1\u00a0%), 320 other medical staff (9.4\u00a0%), 286 dental doctors (8.4\u00a0%), and 627 administrative officers (18.3\u00a0%). At full cost, 2109 (61.7\u00a0%) indicated no intention to receive vaccination, while only 4.4\u00a0% expressed willingness to be vaccinated and 33.9\u00a0% remained undecided. With total self-payment, the vaccination acceptance rates were the highest and lowest among medical doctors (11.4\u00a0%) and nurses (1.0\u00a0%), respectively. Cost (38.1\u00a0%), followed by safety issues (29.5\u00a0%) and concerns regarding efficacy or medical necessity (20.3\u00a0%), emerged as the primary barrier. The projected vaccination intention increased to 43.9\u00a0% and 54.9\u00a0% at reduced self-pay costs of 3000 JPY and 5000 JPY, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Addressing financial constraints through policy interventions could be effective strategies in increasing overall vaccination coverage among healthcare workers. In addition, providing tailored education on vaccine safety, efficacy, and necessity may further facilitate increased vaccine uptake within this critical population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rwandan individuals bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are at-risk of Ebola virus disease. A 2019 to 2021 vaccination campaign called UMURINZI offered a Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. 2-dose heterologous Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo) to Rwandan individuals aged \u22652 years and not pregnant. In this region with high rates of pregnancy, preventing pregnancy until their second dose of the Ebola vaccine is essential to ensure full protection. This analysis describes contraceptive use, pregnancy incidence, serious adverse events (SAE), and the effect of pregnancy and SAE on receipt of the second dose among women in the UMURINZI vaccination campaign.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: During the vaccination campaign, women who were fertile and sexually active were counseled as part of the campaign by trained UMURINZI nursing staff about preventing pregnancy until dose two (56 days post-dose one) and offered contraception. Women were followed up to their second dose appointment. Contraception, pregnancy incidence, and SAE were recorded. Of the 47,585 fertile and sexually active women, the mean age was 28\u00b70 years (standard deviation 9\u00b79 years), 54\u00b77% (n = 26,051) were from Rubavu and 45\u00b73% (n = 21,534) were from Rusizi, and 71\u00b79% (n = 34,158) had not crossed the DRC border in the last year. Sixty-six percent (66\u00b76%, n = 31,675) were not using modern contraception at baseline and 19\u00b71% (n = 9,082) were using hormonal implants, 10\u00b79% (n = 5,204) injectables, 2\u00b79% (n = 1,393) oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), and 0\u00b75% (n = 231) intrauterine devices. After contraceptive counseling, 8\u00b70% (n = 2,549) of non-users initiated a method of contraception and 3\u00b76% (n = 50) of OCP users switched to a more effective method. Of the 969 incident pregnancies detected after dose one, 18\u00b78% (n = 182) resulted in an obstetric SAE, primarily due to spontaneous abortion which occurred in 16\u00b70% (n = 155) of all incident pregnancies. Other obstetric SAE included 14 blighted ova, 9 stillbirths, 1 termination due to hydrops fetalis, 1 cleft palate, and 2 threatened abortions resulting in normal deliveries. Six pregnant women had a non-obstetric SAE (0\u00b76%), including 1 postpartum death from COVID-19 and 5 hospitalizations. Among the 74,002 women without an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 0\u00b701% (n = 4) had an SAE; 2 were fatalities due to hypertension and diabetes in one case and seizures in the other, and the other 2 were hospitalizations. No SAE were determined to be related to the vaccine by the program physicians. Among the 74,002 women without an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 94\u00b76% (n = 69,986) received dose two; in contrast, among the 969 women with an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 34\u00b75% (n = 334) received dose two after pregnancy completion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many fertile and sexually active women who sought vaccination during UMURINZI were not using contraception prior to vaccination, and contraceptive method uptake after family planning counseling and method provision was low. Most women who became pregnant after the first vaccination dose did not receive the second dose, thus potentially reducing protection against Ebola. Family planning messaging for this context should be developed and pilot-tested. The estimated risk of spontaneous abortion was similar to previous estimates from Rwanda and other African countries."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health problem and may result in co-infection with other pathogens such as influenza virus. This review investigates the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B among patients with COVID-19.\nMETHODS: This meta- analysis included 38 primary studies investigating co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza in confirmed cases of COVID-19. The global online databases were used to identify relevant studies published between December 2019 and July 2024. Data analysis was performed using STATA Ver. 17 software, and standard errors of prevalence were calculated using the binomial distribution formula. Heterogeneity of study results was evaluated using the I-square and Q index, and publication bias was examined using the Begg's and Egger's tests, as well as funnel plot. A random effects model was used to determine prevalence rates, and a forest plot diagram was used to present results with 95% confidence intervals. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to check the impact of each primary study on the overall estimate.\nRESULT: The analysis found that the prevalence of influenza in co-infected patients at 95% confidence interval using a random effect model was 14% (95% CI: 8-20%). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the random-effects model for influenza A, 11% (95% CI: 5-18%) and B, 4% (95% CI: 2-7%) in co-infected patients. The highest prevalence of influenza A/B (21%), influenza A (17%) and influenza B (20%) was shown in Asia and Europe respectively. Subgroup analysis by study year showed that the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B was similar in the pre-2021 and post-2021 time periods, at 14% (95% CI: 5-23%) for pre-2021 and 6-22% for 2021 and post-2021. Also, the overall prevalence of influenza A and B in COVID-19 patients is 11% and 4%, and there was no significant difference between the time periods before and after 2021. Meta-regression with a random-effects model showed that the variables location, year group, and total patients showed only 2.71% of very high heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 99.92%), and none of these variables had a significant effect on the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Also, meta-regression results showed that these variables had no significant effect on influenza A and B prevalence (p\u2009>\u20090.05) and showed only a small proportion of the very high heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 99.72%), (I\u00b2 = 68.78%). In our study, Egger's test indicated that there was publication bias or small study effects in this meta-analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.0000).\nCONCLUSION: The combination of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza and other respiratory viruses requires the best treatment protocols to reduce the severity of the disease. In this approach, high vaccination coverage against seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 could reduce the risk of co-infection in the recent pandemic."

            "abstract": "Background Despite ongoing waves of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, including significant surges such as the 10th wave, understanding the impact of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination on infection risk and associated behavioral changes remains crucial. This study aims to urgently evaluate the effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination on COVID-19 infection rates and related behaviors among participants of the Yamato Project, which includes employees of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Methods A case-control study was conducted using data collected from a survey administered by the Japan Small and Medium Enterprise Management Council in December 2023. Participants included individuals who were part of the Yamato Project, not necessarily limited to SME employees. The survey gathered information on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 infection status, vaccination history, health status before January 2020, and various preventive behaviors. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between vaccination status and COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 913 participants were included in the final analysis. The adjusted ORs for COVID-19 infection among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.33-2.57, p < 0.001). The odds of contracting COVID-19 increased with the number of vaccine doses: one to two doses (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46, p = 0.020), three to four doses (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.35-3.08, p = 0.001), and five to seven doses (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.07-4.56, p = 0.033). Behavioral analysis indicated that a reduced frequency of bathing and exercising was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates (p < 0.05). Conclusions The study observed a higher reported incidence of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated individuals during the pandemic period, which increased with the number of vaccine doses received. This paradoxical finding may be influenced by various factors, including immune response mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or original antigenic sin, behavioral changes, and exposure risk. Understanding these factors is crucial for urgently enhancing public health strategies and vaccination programs."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Each of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has its characteristics that can affect their effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and patient mortality. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including whole-virus, protein-based, and vector-based on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality.\nMETHODS: The current cohort study was conducted using the data of all people who received at least two doses of each type of COVID-19 vaccine from March 2020 to August 2022 in Khorasan Rzavi province. Quantitative data were characterized using measures of central tendency and dispersion, while the risks of infection, hospitalization, and mortality were assessed for each type of vaccine. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate the effect of various vaccine types on infection rate, hospitalization, and mortality while adjusting for other independent variables.\nRESULTS: In this study, over 2\u00a0million vaccinated individuals had received at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Whole-virus vaccines, which had an infection rate of 3%, a hospitalization rate of 1.4%, and a mortality rate of 0.2%, were the most effective vaccines. The study also identified several factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory issues, age, sex, diabetes, olfactory dysfunction, fever, chills, body mass index (BMI), and the type of vaccine.\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the substantial impact of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates in Iran. The results support the use of whole-virus and vector-based vaccines as more effective options for preventing COVID-19 outcomes. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering various factors, including medical history and side effects, when evaluating the effectiveness of different vaccine types.

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of NMV/r versus best supportive care for 54 patient cohorts, specified according to age, vaccination status and comorbidity burden.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously published and validated cost-effectiveness model was utilized and adapted to the Swedish setting. The model used a short-term decision-tree (1\u2009year) followed by a lifetime 2-state Markov model. The short-term decision-tree captured costs and outcomes associated with the primary infection. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was only considered in terms of quality-of-life decrements for one year. Baseline hospitalization and mortality risks were taken from a Swedish, nationwide, uniquely granular, Omicron-era, real-world study. NMV/r effectiveness were taken from an Omicron-era US real-world study. Remaining inputs were informed by previous COVID-19 studies and publicly available Swedish sources.\nRESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) showed a large variation ranging from almost nine million SEK for some of the youngest cohorts to being dominant (i.e. cost-saving with higher gains in quality-of-life vs standard of care) for twelve elderly cohorts. In general, higher age in combination with non-recent (>180\u2009days) or no vaccination led to lower ICERs. Specifically, NMV/r was cost-effective for all but one patient cohorts at least 70\u2009years old, and for most patient cohorts 60-69\u2009years old.\nLIMITATIONS: As the COVID-19 landscape changes, symptom burden and baseline risks constantly change. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of NMV/r will change with time. However, the future risks could be related to the risks in the current study, and thus remain useful for decision makers.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that NMV/r is a cost-effective or even cost-saving treatment option for many patient cohorts, including most elderly and not-recently vaccinated patients with at least some comorbidity burden."

However, in order to reduce transmission rates and protect more vulnerable and immunocompromised individuals unable to mount an effective immune response, development of a next-generation of mucosal vaccines is necessary. Here, we developed an intranasal Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based vaccine expressing the spike of the XBB.1.5 variant stabilized in its pre-fusion conformation (NDV-HXP-S). We demonstrated that one or two intranasal immunizations with live NDV-HXP-S expressing the XBB.1.5 spike induces systemic and mucosal antibody responses in mice and protects them from a challenge with the XBB.1.5 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, one or two intranasal vaccinations with NDV-HXP-S XBB.1.5 protected hamsters from variant matched infection and reduced virus emission, thereby providing complete protection to na\u00efve animals in a direct contact transmission study. The data shown in this study supports the notion that intranasal vaccination with variant-adapted NDV-HXP-S induces protective mucosal immunity and reduces transmission rates, highlighting the robust protective efficacy of a single mucosal vaccination in mice and hamsters."

The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine on the prognosis of individuals infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.\nMETHODS: In a single-center, retrospective cohort study, all adult patients with COVID-19 from designated hospital in Xi'an, China, during the Delta outbreak from December 2021 to January 2022 were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they received the COVID-19 vaccine, and differences in clinical outcomes (pneumonia, oxygen therapy, severe disease, and mechanical ventilation or death), symptoms, and nucleic acid-negative time between the two groups were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 651 adult patients with COVID-19 were included, among whom 578 were vaccinated and 73 were not vaccinated. Compared with the unvaccinated group, the vaccinated group had lower rates of pneumonia (49.8% vs. 67.1%; P=0.005), oxygen therapy (20.9% vs. 57.5%; P&lt;0.001), severe illness (1.6% vs. 26.0%; P&lt;0.001), and mechanical ventilation or mortality (0.3% vs. 13.7%; P&lt;0.001).

            "abstract": "The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has evolved throughout the pandemic, with initially low infection rates rising significantly as a result of the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant. Adolescents, children from ethnic minorities and lower-income households, and those with obesity are at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The immune response in children leads to milder symptoms compared to adults, with fever and cough being most frequent; tough symptoms vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant and age. Diagnostic methods to confirm current or past infection include reverse transcription PCR, rapid antigen tests, and serology. Treatment is mainly supportive, with antivirals and glucocorticoids reserved for severe cases. While serious conditions like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and other post-COVID-19 conditions are rare, they require careful management. Vaccination has proven effective in reducing severe disease and protecting against post-COVID-19 conditions. Continued surveillance, including wastewater monitoring and universal or pooled testing, remains crucial for controlling community spread. Key questions remain regarding the duration and quality of immunity after reinfection or vaccination, the impact of coinfections, and optimal treatment protocols for different pediatric populations."

Studies have used multilevel analyses to examine how a context, such as a neighbourhood, can affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of the people within it. However, few multilevel studies have quantified the magnitude of the general contextual effect (GCE) in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and assessed how it may be associated with individual- and area-level characteristics. To address this gap, we will illustrate the application of the median rate ratio (MRR) in a multilevel Poisson analysis for quantifying the GCE in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in Ontario, Canada.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based, two-level multilevel observational study where individuals were nested into regions (i.e., forward sortation areas [FSAs]). The study population included community-dwelling adults in Ontario, Canada, between March 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021. The model included seven individual-level variables (age, sex, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and four FSA census-based variables (household size, household income, employment, and driving to work). The MRR is a median value of the rate ratios comparing two patients with identical characteristics randomly selected from two different regions ordered by rate. We examined the attenuation of the MRR after including individual-level and FSA census-based variables to assess their role in explaining the variation in rates between regions.\nRESULTS: Of the 11 789 128 Ontario adult community-dwelling residents, 343 787 had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. After adjusting for individual-level and FSA census-based variables, the MRR was attenuated to 1.67 (39% reduction from unadjusted MRR). The strongest FSA census-based associations were household size (RR\u2009=\u20091.88, 95% CI: 1.71-1.97) and driving to work (RR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.65-0.71).\nCONCLUSIONS: The individual- and area-level characteristics in our study accounted for approximately 40% of the between-region variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates measured by MRR in Ontario, Canada. These findings suggest that population-based policies to address social determinants of health that attenuate the MRR may reduce the observed between-region heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates."

            "abstract": "AIMS: The contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection on lung damage and the effect of vaccination on either containing the number of deaths or mitigating lung damage has not been systematically investigated.\nMETHODS: Post-mortem analysis was performed among consecutive in-patients with COVID-19 deceased in the Province of Trieste (2020-2022). The outcomes of the study were (i) rates of in-hospital mortality, (ii) contribution of COVID-19 to death, (iii) histological extent of lung injury and (iv) impact of vaccination.\nRESULTS: A total of 1038 consecutive hospitalized patients who died with SARS-CoV-2 infection were autopsied and deep histological analysis of the lungs was performed in a randomly selected sample of 508 cases. Among them, SARS-CoV-2 infection was (a) the cause of death (n\u2009=\u200990), (b) contributing to death (n\u2009=\u2009304) and (c) an accompanying feature (n\u2009=\u2009114). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as the primary cause of mortality decreased over time (23.8% in 2020, 20.9% in 2021 and 7.9% in 2022). On multivariable analysis, vaccination (any dose) was independently associated with lower rates of death related to SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR .15, p\u2009<\u2009.001), after adjusting for other independent predictors. A total of 172 patients were vaccinated at least with two doses at the time of death: 93% triple-vaccinated, 7% double-vaccinated. On histological analysis, vaccinated patients had a greater frequency of pneumonia severity score 0 and 1 (20.3% vs. 5.4% and 20.9% vs. 7.7%, p\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively), and a substantially lower proportion of pneumonia severity score 3 (26.2% vs. 55.1%, p\u2009<\u2009.001) compared to unvaccinated patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination has substantially reduced rates of death related to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time and may have the ability to mitigate lung damage."

            "abstract": "Data from the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) were analyzed to estimate coverage with childhood vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices among U.S. children by age 24 months. Coverage with nearly all vaccines was lower among children born in 2020 and 2021 than it was among those born in 2018 and 2019, with declines ranging from 1.3 to 7.8 percentage points. Analyses of NIS-Child data for earlier birth cohorts have not revealed such widespread declines in routine childhood vaccination coverage. Coverage among children born during 2020-2021 varied by race and ethnicity, health insurance status, poverty status, urbanicity, and jurisdiction. Compared with non-Hispanic White children, coverage with four of the 17 vaccine measures was lower among non-Hispanic Black or African American children as well as Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native children. Coverage was also generally lower among those covered by Medicaid or other nonprivate insurance, uninsured children, children living below the federal poverty level, and children living in rural areas. Coverage varied widely by jurisdiction, especially coverage with \u22652 doses of influenza vaccine. Children born during 2020-2021 were born during or after the period of major disruption of primary care from the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers should review children's histories and recommend needed vaccinations during every clinical encounter. Addressing financial barriers, access issues, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine-related misinformation can also help to increase coverage, reduce disparities, and protect all children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Strategies that have been found effective include implementation of standing orders and reminder and recall systems, strong physician recommendations to vaccinate, and use of immunization information systems to identify areas of lower coverage that could benefit from targeted interventions to increase immunization rates."

We evaluated the BBIBP-CorV vaccine's effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe disease, and mortality during the third wave of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.\nMETHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study in North Central Province from May 2021 to February 2022. Evidence of vaccination was obtained from the national registry. The PCR-positive patients were cases, while negative individuals were controls. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) was computed for fully, partially, and non-vaccinated groups in reducing symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe disease, and mortality.\nRESULTS: Our study involved 3305 cases and 3418 controls. The overall aVE for preventing PCR-positive infection in fully vaccinated was 30\u00b78\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI:17\u00b79-41\u00b76). In fully vaccinated over 60 years, the overall aVE was 72\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 49\u00b77-84\u00b78). Full vaccination with BBIBP-CorV is effective in reducing hospitalisation, severe COVID-19 disease, and death, with aVE rates of 70\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 57\u00b79-79\u00b70), 88\u00b79\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 81\u00b78-93\u00b72), and 92\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 84\u00b78-96\u00b71) respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Individuals who have received two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine are protected against hospitalisation, severe COVID-19 disease, and death. Duration of protection against hospitalisation, severe COVID-19, and fatal COVID-19 sustained at least 121 days, with no sign of waning during that time."

Therefore, this study aimed to determine awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention among Iranian farmers.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a valid questionnaire with 336 farmers randomly selected from villages in Kurdistan Province, Iran. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be 18 years of age or older and currently working on a farm in the study region.\nRESULTS: The mean age years of participants was 49.31\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u200912.23. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of attitude and performance scores were 11.50\u2009\u00b1\u20093.78 (min\u2009=\u20092, max\u2009=\u200920) and 9.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.48 (min\u2009=\u20090, max\u2009=\u200915), respectively. The findings indicate that while 90.2% of participants are aware of the risks of prolonged sun exposure, misconceptions remain. Only 46.4% recognize UV dangers on cloudy days, and 63.4% understand sunscreen use is needed beyond sunny conditions. Awareness of specific risks like skin cancer (42.6%) and sunburn (27.4%) is moderate, while knowledge of cataracts (6.8%) and premature skin aging (9.2%) is low. Barriers to sunscreen use persist, with only 22.3% deeming it important and 40.8% finding it convenient. The risk of developing skin cancer was underestimated in 131 (39.0%) participants.\nCONCLUSION: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention among farmers in Iran are low. There is a need for culturally appropriate educational messages and intervention programs to increase awareness, improve attitudes, and promote preventive behaviors among farmers."

            "title": "Early Detection of Basal Cell Carcinoma of Skin From Medical History.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, originating from basal cells in the skin's outer layer. It frequently arises from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Although BCC rarely metastasizes, it can cause significant local tissue damage if left untreated. Early detection is essential to prevent extensive damage and potential disfigurement. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently remains uncertain about the benefits and potential harms of routine skin cancer screenings in asymptomatic individuals. This paper evaluates the accuracy of predicting BCC using patients' medical histories to address this uncertainty and support early detection efforts.\nMETHODS: We analyzed the medical histories of 405,608 patients, including 7733 with BCC. We categorized 25,154 diagnoses into 16 body systems based on the hierarchy in the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology. For each body system, we identified the most severe condition present. Logistic Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was then employed to predict BCC, using demographic information, body systems, and pairwise and triple combinations of body systems, as well as missing value indicators. The dataset was split into 90% for training and 10% for validation. Model performance was evaluated using McFadden's R 2 , Percentage Deviance Explained (PDE), and cross-validated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nRESULTS: Diagnoses related to the Integument system showed an 8-fold higher likelihood of being associated with BCC compared to diagnoses related to other systems. Older (age from 60 to 69) white individuals were more likely to receive a BCC diagnosis. After training the model, it achieved a McFadden's R 2 of 0.286, an AUC of 0.912, and a PDE of 28.390%, reflecting a high level of explained variance and prediction accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of LASSO Regression models to enhance early identification of BCC. Extant medical history of patients, available in electronic health records, can accurately predict the risk of BCC. Integrating such predictive models into clinical practice could significantly improve early detection and intervention."

            "abstract": "Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) form the majority of skin cancers, with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) being the most common and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) being second. Prolonged ultraviolet (UV) exposure, aging, male gender, and immunosuppression represent most of the causes of this category of diseases. BCCs and cSCCs both include different types of skin cancers, such as nodular or morpheaform BCC or flat cSCC. Locally advanced and metastatic NMSCs cannot be treated surgically; thus, systemic therapy (TKI and Immunotherapy) is needed. Interestingly, NMSCs are frequently linked to abnormal Hedgehog (HH) signaling which most systemic immunotherapies for these cancers are based upon. Of note, the first line therapies of BCC, sonidegib and vismodegib, are HH inhibitors. Programmed death receptor 1 antibody (PD-1) inhibitors such as cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab have been approved for the treatment of cSCC. Thus, this paper reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and treatment options for both BCC and cSCC."

            "abstract": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) ranks as the most common form of skin cancer in the United States, and its prevalence continues to increase. Regular self-examinations of the skin can significantly enhance treatment outcomes. This report investigates a rare instance of BCC initially misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis, stemming from a longstanding wound on the patient's left shoulder. A 66-year-old male with a history of working in construction presented with a non-healing wound on his left shoulder, which he initially sustained from a metallic rod injury. Despite self-treatment, the wound deteriorated, revealing subcutaneous fat and producing foul-smelling drainage. Imaging suggested osteomyelitis, but the persistent and worsening nature of the wound over two years, previously concealed from his family and healthcare providers, prompted further investigation. A biopsy confirmed infiltrative BCC. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for comprehensive treatment, including long-term antibiotics for osteomyelitis and systemic therapy with vismodegib for BCC. Basal cell carcinoma commonly appears as a pink or flesh-colored papule or nodule, often with surface features that aid in early identification and treatment. Yet, infiltrative BCC, like the case described here, can pose diagnostic challenges because of its subtle yet aggressive characteristics. The complex causes of BCC highlight the necessity of preventive actions, particularly for those with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Treatment approaches primarily aim at removing the tumor and may incorporate targeted therapies for more advanced instances. This case underscores the importance of regular skin self-examinations and prompt medical attention for lingering wounds, particularly among those at higher risk. Successfully addressing BCC demands a comprehensive strategy involving surgery, targeted chemotherapy, and preventive actions against potential future skin malignancies. Maintaining long-term surveillance is crucial for individuals with prior BCC diagnoses to detect any potential recurrence and address any enduring consequences of treatment."

            "abstract": "Gel manicures have become part of a popular personal care service in the last two decades due to increased longevity of the polish and the added strength to the nail plate. Prolonged exposure to nail ultraviolet (UV) lamps is required to cure the gel polish. Despite the increased use of UV nail lamps, there is limited consensus in the literature on the risk of skin malignancy associated with UV nail lamps. The objective of this article was to provide a systematic review of the risk of skin malignancy associated with the use of UV nail lamps and to synthesize evidence-based recommendations on their safe usage. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the databases, Medline and Embase, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 2,331 non-duplicate articles. Nine were ultimately included, of which three were case reports, one was a cross-sectional study, and five were experimental studies. The risk of bias per the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was high or unclear, likely due to the number of case reports included. Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV nail lamps may pose a low risk of skin cancer. It is important to note that the available evidence is weak, and patients should be informed about the limited data to make their own decisions. Dermatologists and other healthcare providers should be updated with the latest evidence to address patients' concerns about gel manicures and suggest practices which can effectively reduce the risk of cutaneous malignancy associated with gel manicures, such as the use of UV-blocking gloves or properly applied sunscreens."

During the healing process, it can cause peeling, irritation, and some long-term effects, including premature aging, pigmentation, and a high risk of skin cancer. Rutin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce inflammation and soothe sunburned skin. The objective of the current proposal is to develop and create carbopol gel-encased glycerosomes for the treatment of sunburn. The Design of Expert (DoE) technique was used to optimize the proposed formulation and was subjected to various characterization parameters such as nanovesicles size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, entrapment efficiency (EE), and surface morphology. The optimized rutin-loaded glycerosomes (opt-RUT-loaded-GMs) were further characterised for drug release, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The formulation showed sustained release, greater permeation into the skin, and good antioxidant activity. The dermatokinetic study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs confirms that the Rutin hydrate had better retention in the epidermis as compared to the dermis, owing to its potential for long lasting protection after topical application. It was observed that the prepared formulation was stable, highly safe, and had good sun protection factor (SPF) values that could be used as a suitable option for topical drug administration to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs."

Public health measures have been vital in tackling the increased incidence and prevalence of melanoma. The management of melanoma has been revolutionised with the approval of new immunotherapy treatments (anti PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 antibodies) and targeted therapies (BRAF and MEK inhibitors). With some of these therapies becoming the standard of care in the management of advanced disease, it is likely we will see their use increase in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Recently, literature has demonstrated the benefits patients could derive from the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) due to the promising results on its efficacy when compared to monotherapy. However, greater clarity on its use is needed in more unique presentations such as BRAF-wild type melanoma, where the lack of driver mutations makes disease management more challenging. Surgical resection remains an integral part of the management of earlier stages of the disease with a consequent decrease in reliance on other forms of therapy such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Finally, we evaluated the novel emerging experimental approaches to treatment such as adoptive T cell therapy, novel oncolytic treatments and cancer vaccines. We discussed how their use could improve patients' prognosis, enhance treatment efficacy, and potentially achieve cure."

            "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, and, in some individuals, pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, and/or immunodeficiency. Ocular findings include nystagmus, reduced iris pigment, reduced retinal pigment, foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the range of 20/50 to 20/400), and strabismus in many individuals. Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually at least a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in variable degrees of bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and/or other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, colitis, and/or neutropenia have been reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in some HPS-related genes. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early 30s and can progress to death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected individuals. Neutropenia and/or immune defects occur primarily in individuals with pathogenic variants in AP3B1 and AP3D1.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The clinical diagnosis of HPS can be established in a proband with hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, characteristic eye findings, and demonstration of absence of platelet delta granules (dense bodies) on electron microscopy. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in AP3B1, AP3D1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S5, BLOC1S6, DTNBP1, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, or HPS6 confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors and use of low vision aids; preferential seating in school; low-vision consultant as needed; UV-blocking sunglasses; surgery for strabismus as needed; protection from sun exposure with protective clothing and sunscreen; standard treatment for skin cancer; thrombin-soaked Gelfoam\u00ae for skin wounds with prolonged bleeding; medical alert bracelet and bleeding management plan; humidifier to reduce frequency of epistaxis; oral contraceptives and IUD for menorrhagia; DDAVP\u00ae (desmopressin acetate) for wisdom tooth extraction and invasive procedures; platelet or red blood cell transfusions for surgery or protracted bleeding; HLA-matched single-donor platelets as needed; maximize pulmonary function with prompt treatment of asthma and pulmonary infections; influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines; regular moderate exercise; supplemental oxygen for advanced-stage pulmonary fibrosis; lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary disease; steroids, other anti-inflammatory agents, and/or Remicade\u00ae for granulomatous colitis. Immunodeficiency, when present, is lifelong and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor responsive, and affected individuals benefit from an infection prevention plan. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination including assessment for refractive errors; annual skin examination for evidence of sun-induced skin damage (e.g., solar keratoses [premalignant lesions], basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma); annual pulmonary function testing in those older than age 20 years; colonoscopy in those with symptoms of colitis (e.g., cramping, mucoid stools, hematochezia, melena); assessment for clinical and laboratory manifestations of immunodeficiency. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory products, aspirin-containing products, and other anticoagulants unless medically indicated; activities that increase the risk of bleeding; all tobacco and vaping products and inhalation of chemical and physical substances injurious to the lungs; unprotected and direct sun exposure. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In families with HPS3-, HPS5-, or HPS6-related HPS (milder types of HPS in which hypopigmentation and nystagmus may not be clinically evident), it is appropriate to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: HPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an HPS-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the HPS-causing pathogenic variants are identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

            "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, with an increasing worldwide incidence in recent decades. The main risk factor for increasing the skin cancer incidence is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Of the two major forms of skin cancer (melanomas and non-melanotic cancers), the cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most aggressive form, causing about 80% of the deaths resulted from this type of tumor. Malignant melanoma develops through malignant transformation of melanocytes in the skin because of prolonged exposure to solar or artificial UV. The malignant transformation of the melanocytes in the skin is accompanied by the presence of a local inflammatory reaction that, in the initial stages of carcinogenesis, would oppose to tumor development. Chronic exposure to UV or other etiopathogenic factors induces chronic inflammation, which, by producing inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins), constitutes a tumoral microenvironment that favors carcinogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis, and the presence of neoplastic \"mutant cells\" that avoid the protective action of the immune system. Using immunohistochemistry techniques, we assessed the intra- and peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate cells in CM. The chronic inflammatory infiltrate presented more intense in the peritumoral stroma compared to the intratumoral one, heterogenous, more intensely composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells (MCs), the most numerous cells in the inflammatory infiltrate being T-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages; B-lymphocytes and MCs were in a small number, especially intratumorally. Inflammatory cells had a direct contact with tumor cells, blood vessels, connective matrix, suggesting that the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role in carcinogenesis, tumor invasion, local angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis."

            "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people worldwide. Anxiety, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, myocardial infarction, and cancer, among other disorders, are known to increase the risk of depression. Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) can cause human serotonin levels to increase. The vitamin D pathway is one mechanism through which ultraviolet light absorbed through the skin can affect mood; however, UVB exposure is known to increase the risk of cancer. In this study, we explored the effects of prolonged exposure to UVB on depression. Data were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 2008 to 2013. Each patient with depression was matched 1:4 with a comparison patient by sex and age (\u00b15 years); thus, the study included 23,579 patients with depression and 94,316 healthy controls for comparison. The patients had been exposed to UVB for at least 1 year to observe the cumulative effect of UVB exposure. Based on the World Health Organization UV index, we divided the observation period data into five UV levels: low, moderate, high, very high, and extreme. A multivariate Poisson regression model was used to assess the risk of depression according to UVB exposure level, adjusting for sex, age, income, urbanization level, month, and comorbidities. The results revealed that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with depression was 0.889 for moderate levels (95% CI 0.835-0.947), 1.134 for high levels (95% CI: 1.022-1.260), 1.711 for very high levels (95% CI: 1.505-1.945), and 2.785 for extreme levels (95% CI: 2.439-3.180) when compared to low levels. Moderate levels of UVB lowered the risk of depression, while high levels of UVB gradually increased the risk. We propose that UVB at normal concentrations can effectively improve depression. However, exposure to high concentrations of UVB damage DNA results in physical diseases such as skin cancer, which increase the risk of depression."

We analyzed six observational studies and four traditional reviews. Two out of 10 studies concluded that no relationship exists between the incidence of NMSC and HU. The remaining eight studies indicated the association. According to these studies, the possible risk factors include old age, excessive exposure to sunlight, higher doses, and prolonged HU therapy duration. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and HU play a combined role in carcinogenesis. Periodic dermatologic screening is essential in these patients. Prompt biopsy and accurate diagnosis can prevent the progression of cancer and decrease the associated morbidity and mortality. True incidence and causation cannot be ascertained due to the scarcity of research on this topic. Multi-center prospective studies in large groups of Ph-MPN patients are recommended to determine the temporal relationship between NMSC and HU treatment."

            "abstract": "Despite growing public awareness of the adverse consequences of excessive sun exposure, modifying sun-seeking behavior is challenging because it appears to be driven by addictive mechanisms. This can have effects on health because sun exposure, although beneficial, when prolonged and repeated shows a causal relationship with skin cancer risk. Using data from 2,500 United Kingdom twins, we observed sun seeking to be significantly heritable (h2 \u2265 58%). In a GWAS meta-analysis of sun-seeking behavior in 261,915 subjects of European ancestry, we identified five GWAS-significant loci previously associated with addiction, behavioral and personality traits, cognitive function, and educational attainment and enriched for CNS gene expression: MIR2113 (P\u00a0= 2.08\u00a0\u00d7 10-11), FAM76B/MTMR2/CEP57 (P\u00a0= 3.70\u00a0\u00d7 10-9), CADM2 (P\u00a0= 9.36\u00a0\u00d7 10-9), TMEM182 (P\u00a0=\u00a01.64\u00a0\u00d7 10-8), and PLCL1/LINC01923/SATB2 (P\u00a0= 3.93\u00a0\u00d7 10-8). These findings imply that the behavior concerning UV exposure is complicated by a genetic predisposition shared with neuropsychological traits. This should be taken into consideration when designing awareness campaigns and may help improve people's attitudes toward sun exposure."

            "title": "Systemic availability of lipophilic organic UV filters through dermal sunscreen exposure.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemical UV filters are common components in sunscreens and cosmetic products and used to protect the skin against harmful effects of sunlight like sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2\u202fmg/cm2; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4\u202fh): 1\u202fmg/cm2 each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures.\nRESULTS: Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11\u202f\u03bcg/L, 25\u202f\u03bcg/L and 1352\u202f\u03bcg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207\u202f\u03bcg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16\u202fh after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2\u202fdays. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC.\nDISCUSSION: Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites."

            "abstract": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main modifiable risk factor for skin cancer. The Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) was introduced as a tool to visualize the intensity of UV radiation on a certain day, which should enable and encourage people to take appropriate protective measures. The 'low' exposure category of the UVI, defined by a rounded UVI value of 0, 1 or 2, was linked to the health message 'No protection required' by the World Health Organization and partner organizations. However, published evidence corroborating this advice is not available. To evaluate the erythemal risk of low UVI days, we analyzed 14,431 daily time series of ambient erythemal irradiance data measured at nine stations of the German solar UV monitoring network during the years 2007-2016. We analyzed the proportion of days in the sample for which ambient erythemal doses calculated for various time intervals exceed average minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of the Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I-VI to assess the potential for erythema arising from sun exposure on days with low UVI values. Additionally, we calculated for each day the minimum exposure duration needed to receive one MED. Our results indicate that on days with a UVI value of 0, risk of erythema is indeed negligible. Conversely, the abovementioned health message appears misleading when melano-compromised individuals (skin type I and II) spend more than 1.5 hours outdoors on days with a UVI value of 2. Under rare circumstances of prolonged exposure, MEDs of the two most sensitive skin types can also be exceeded even on days with a UVI value of 1. Hence, current WHO guidance for sun protection on days with low UVI values needs reconsideration."

            "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes photoaging of the skin and induces a number of disorders, including sunburn, fine and coarse wrinkles, and skin cancer risk. Therefore, the application of sunscreen has gained much attention to reduce the harmful effects of UV irradiation on our skin. Recently, there has been a growing demand for the replacement of chemical sunscreens with natural UV-absorbing compounds. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), promising alternative natural UV-absorbing compounds, are a group of widely distributed, low molecular-weight, water-soluble molecules that can absorb UV radiation and disperse the absorbed energy as heat, without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). More than 30 MAAs have been characterized, from a variety of organisms. In addition to their UV-absorbing properties, there is substantial evidence that MAAs have the potential to protect against skin aging, including antioxidative activity, anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of protein-glycation, and inhibition of collagenase activity. This review will provide an overview of MAAs, as potential anti-aging ingredients, beginning with their structure, before moving on to discuss the most recent experimental observations, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which MAAs might protect the skin. In particular, we focus on the potential anti-aging activity of mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G)."

Dietary carotenoids distributed to skin are hypothesized to protect skin against UV-induced damage, although other phytochemicals may play a role. We hypothesize that tomato consumption would protect against skin cancer. SKH-1 hairless and immunocompetent mice (n\u2009=\u2009180) were fed AIN-93G or AIN-93G\u2009+\u200910% tangerine or red tomato powder for 35 weeks. From weeks 11-20, mice (n\u2009=\u2009120) were exposed to 2240\u2009J/m2 UV-B light, 3x/week, and tumors were tracked weekly. Control mice were fed the same diets but not exposed to UV. Tumor number was significantly lower in male mice consuming red tomato diets (1.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50, P\u2009=\u20090.015) or pooled tomato diets (2.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45, P\u2009=\u20090.017) compared to controls (4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65). Carotenoid levels in plasma and skin were quantitated, with total lycopene higher in skin of tangerine fed animals despite a lower dose. Metabolomic analyses elucidated compounds derived from tomato glycoalkaloids (including tomatidine and hydroxylated-tomatidine) as significantly different metabolites in skin after tomato exposure. Here, we describe that tomato consumption can modulate risk for keratinocyte carcinomas; however, the role of the newly identified specific phytochemicals possibly responsible for this action require further investigation."

We divided the patient population in which the occupation was accurately identified in two study groups: occupations with UV exposure (OW), and non-UV exposed occupations (IW) and we compared the clinical and histologic features of the lesions in the two groups.\nRESULTS: The most affected area in both groups was the facial \"mask area\". The cheek was second most affected area in exposed group whereas the scalp area was the second most affected in the non-exposed group. The nodular pattern is the most numerous in both groups (30 lesions in OW group and 15 lesions in the IW group with a mean number of lesions of 1.57\u00b10.90 and 1.27\u00b10.46, respectively) with the mixed type being the second most frequent type for both groups. However, for the OW group the mixed type with an aggressive component was the second most frequent one, while in the non-exposed group, the mixed type with non-aggressive components was the second most frequent, the difference being statistically significant. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict the presence of histopathologically aggressive lesions using gender, age, exposure and anatomical site out of which UV exposure and 3 main anatomical sites (mask zone, cheek and torso) were selected in the final analysis. The probability of the model chi-square (9.430), p\u00a0=\u00a0.05, supports a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in Romania patients diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, occupationally exposed to UV radiation, develop more frequently lesions on the \"mask area\" of the face; furthermore, prediction of the histo-pathologically aggressive lesions may be supported by the presence of occupational UV exposure and anatomical site (mask zone, cheek and torso) involved.Also, these patients may be at a higher risk to develop more aggressive histologic subtype BCCs. Although limited by a number of factors, especially the small number of subjects, these data suggest the necessity of conducting both retrospective and prospective studies on clinical and histological types of BCCs evolving in patients working outdoor along with identifying additional risk factors."

There is a growing interest in the prevention of skin cancer and antiaging treatment because of aging of the population. Currently, ablative fractional photothermolysis (FP) laser treatment is actively being performed for facial rejuvenation.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prove the suppressive effect of CO2 fractional laser (FL) on skin cancer development.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of hairless mice were treated with either CO2 FL or nothing at 3-week intervals during the 20 weeks of UV exposure period. The number of tumors was subsequently counted every 2 weeks over the 30-week period to the termination of the experiment. At 30 weeks, representative tumors were evaluated for tumor type. The authors also determined the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and Type 1 procollagen.\nRESULTS: At 30 weeks, the UV- and FL-treated group showed a significantly lower tumor occurrence rate and a more benign progression of tumors than the UV-only treated group. The UV- and FL-treated group presented a higher mRNA level of Type 1 procollagen and a lower level of MMP-13 than the UV-only treated group.\nCONCLUSION: The occurrence of UV-induced skin tumors can be decreased by multiple sessions of ablative FP with CO2 laser."

Using a two-chamber model, we show that UVA-exposed target cells induce intercellular oxidative signaling to non-irradiated bystander cells. This UVA-mediated bystander stress is observed between all three cutaneous cell types (i.e., keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts). Significantly, melanocytes appear to be more resistant to direct UVA effects compared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, although melanocytes are also more susceptible to bystander oxidative signaling. The extensive intercellular flux of oxidative species has not been previously appreciated and could possibly contribute to the observed cancer risk associated with prolonged UVA exposure."

Often, the efficacy of hand hygiene interventions relies on virus recovery from hands. However, the recovery of bacteriophage phi6 (\u03a66), a recommended surrogate for enveloped viruses, from the entire hands using the ASTM E2011-21 standard has not been optimized. For \u03a66 recovery from the hands, three eluents [lysogeny broth (LC), tryptic soy broth (TSB), and 1.5% beef extract (BE)] and three recovery methods [glove juice method (GJM), hand rinsing, and modified dish method] were examined. The effects of inoculum application on either the palmar surface or the whole hand were compared, and virus recovery was assessed under wet and dry conditions to identify the optimal combinations for maximizing \u03a66 recovery. Statistical differences among methods, inoculum application, and recovery types were identified. While no statistical difference was observed among the eluents (P\u2009=\u20090.281), LC demonstrated the highest \u03a66 recovery efficiency, while TSB and BE had comparable recoveries. Two-way interaction effects were observed between method type vs. application type (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), method type vs. recovery type (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), and application type vs. recovery type (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), indicating these factors influencing one another. Additionally, no \u03a66 recovery was obtained for the dry basis recovery type and the GJM method type. Based on the present study, to maximize \u03a66 recovery from the hands during hand hygiene studies, inoculum should be applied to the palmar surface and recovered while it is still wet using LC."

            "abstract": "Water supply and sanitation are essential household services frequently shared in resource-poor settings. Shared sanitation can increase the risk of enteric pathogen transmission due to suboptimal cleanliness of facilities used by large numbers of individuals. It also can potentially increase the risk of respiratory disease transmission. As sanitation is an essential need, shared sanitation facilities may act as important respiratory pathogen transmission venues even with strict control measures such as stay-at-home recommendations in place. This analysis explores how behavioral and infrastructural conditions surrounding shared sanitation may individually and interactively influence respiratory pathogen transmission. We developed an individual-based community transmission model using COVID-19 as a motivating example parameterized from empirical literature to explore how transmission in shared latrines interacts with transmission at the community level. We explored mitigation strategies, including infrastructural and behavioral interventions. Our review of empirical literature confirms that shared sanitation venues in resource-poor settings are relatively small with poor ventilation and high use patterns. In these contexts, shared sanitation facilities may act as strong drivers of respiratory disease transmission, especially in areas reliant on shared facilities. Decreasing dependence on shared latrines was most effective at attenuating sanitation-associated transmission. Improvements to latrine ventilation and handwashing behavior were also able to decrease transmission. The type and order of interventions are important in successfully attenuating disease risk, with infrastructural and engineering controls being most effective when administered first, followed by behavioral controls after successful attenuation of sufficient alternate transmission routes. Beyond COVID-19, our modeling framework can be extended to address water, sanitation, and hygiene measures targeted at a range of environmentally mediated infectious diseases."

The main aim of the study was to evaluate the association between individual protective measures and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community and to compare secondary attack rates in different exposure settings.\nMETHODS: A case-control study from contact tracing of SARS-CoV-2 index patients. COVID-19 contact tracing was led by nurses at the COVID-19 Coordinating Centre in Majorca (Spain). During the systematic tracing, additional information for this study was collected from the index patient (social-demographic variables, symptoms, the number of close contacts).

Strict hand hygiene is even more important for healthcare workers (HCWs) as unclean hands may aid in transmitting microorganisms from patient to patient, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). In 2002, healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) were a cause of 99,000 deaths in the United States of America, and the 2004 annual economic impact of HCAI was estimated to be US$ 6.5 billion. Evidence suggests that hand sanitization significantly reduces the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens and the incidence of HCAI. Despite emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene, recent studies show poor hand hygiene compliance in medical settings. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hand hygiene encompasses the cleansing of your hands using soap and water, antiseptic hand washes, alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS), or surgical hand antiseptics. These days, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are increasingly used instead of soap and water for hand hygiene in healthcare settings.\u00a0 Their ease of use, increased availability, and proven effectiveness are some of the reasons why alcohol-based hand sanitizers are gaining popularity. In one study, a hospital-wide hand hygiene campaign with special emphasis on bedside alcohol-based hand disinfection resulted in sustained improvement in hand-hygiene compliance, coinciding with reducing nosocomial infections and MRSA transmission. A systematic review also demonstrated with moderate certainty that having bedside alcohol-based solutions increased compliance with hand hygiene among HCWs. However, it is important to keep in mind that the efficacy of alcohol hand sanitizers depends on the type of alcohol, the quantity applied, the technique used, and the consistency of use. There are also situations where these products are not ideal, for example, in preventing the spread of certain alcohol-resistant infections or when hands are significantly soiled and the bacterial load is too high. Alcohol-based (hand) Rub The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an alcohol-based hand rub as: \"An alcohol-containing preparation (liquid, gel or foam) designed for application to the hands to inactivate microorganisms and/or temporarily suppress their growth. Such preparations may contain one or more types of alcohol, other active ingredients with excipients, and humectants.\u201d Alcohol-based hand antiseptics mostly contain isopropanol, ethanol, n-propanol, or a mixture of these as their active ingredients. The antimicrobial activity of alcohols is attributed to their ability to denature and coagulate proteins. This causes microbes to lose their protective coatings and become non-functional. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends formulations containing 80% (percent volume/volume) ethanol or 75% isopropyl alcohol; however, generally speaking, sanitizers containing 60 to 95% alcohol are acceptable. The recommended percentages of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are kept as 80% and 75%\u00a0because\u00a0these values lie in the middle of the acceptable range. Notably, higher than recommended concentrations are also paradoxically less potent because proteins are not denatured easily without the presence of water. Alcohol concentrations in antiseptic hand rubs are often expressed as percent by volume and\u00a0rarely as percent by weight. A study conducted on 85% (weight/weight) ethanol showed that a 15 seconds contact time was enough to reduce gram-positive and negative bacteria by greater than 5 log10 steps. Research suggests that alcohols are swiftly germicidal when applied to the skin but have no noticeable persistent residual activity.\u00a0However, it has been documented that the regrowth of bacteria does occur slowly after its use. This may be because of the sublethal effect alcohol may have had on the residual bacteria. Adding chlorhexidine, octenidine, or triclosan to alcohol-based hand rubs may result in somewhat persistent protection as well. 4% chlorhexidine has shown persistent bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus for up to 4 hours from application. Ethanol, the most common alcohol ingredient, appears to be the most effective alcohol against viruses, whereas propanol is considered a better bactericidal alcohol. The combination of alcohols may also have a synergistic effect. The alcohol concentration in hand sanitizers also changes their efficacy, with one study\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0that a hand rub with 85% ethanol content\u00a0was significantly better at reducing bacterial populations than\u00a0preparations of 60% to 62% ethanol. ABHS also often contain humectants, like glycerin, which helps prevent skin dryness, and emollients or moisturizers, like aloe vera, which help replace some of the water stripped off during use.\u00a0None of the above-mentioned alcohols have shown a potential for acquired bacterial resistance and are therefore considered highly effective for repeated use in medical settings."

            "title": "Psychological and psychosocial determinants of COVID Health Related Behaviours (COHeRe): An evidence and gap map.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in illness, deaths and societal disruption on a global scale. Societies have implemented various control measures to reduce transmission of the virus and mitigate its impact. Individual behavioural changes are crucial to the successful implementation of these measures. Common recommended measures to limit risk of infection include frequent handwashing, reducing the frequency of social interactions and the use of face coverings. It is important to identify those factors that can predict the uptake and maintenance of these protective behaviours.\nOBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify and map the existing evidence (published and unpublished) on psychological and psychosocial factors that determine uptake and adherence to behaviours aimed at reducing the risk of infection or transmission of COVID-19.\nSEARCH METHODS: Our extensive search included electronic databases (n\u2009=\u200912), web searches, conference proceedings, government reports, other repositories including both published peer reviewed, pre-prints and grey literature. The search strategy was built around three concepts of interest including (1) context (terms relating to COVID-19), (2) behaviours of interest and (3) terms related to psychological and psychosocial determinants of COVID Health-Related Behaviours and adherence or compliance with recommended behaviours, to capture both malleable and non-malleable determinants (i.e. determinants that could be changed and those that could not).\nSELECTION CRITERIA: This Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) includes all types of studies examining determinants of common recommended behaviours aimed at mitigating human-to-human spread of COVID-19. All potential malleable and non-malleable determinants of one or more behaviours are included in the map. As part of the mapping process, categories are used to group determinants. The mapping categories were based on a previous rapid review by Hanratty 2021. These include: 'behaviour', 'cognition', 'demographics', 'disease', 'emotions', 'health status', 'information', 'intervention', and 'knowledge'. Those not suitable for categorisation in any of these groups are included in the map as 'other' determinants.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results were imported to a bibliographic reference manager where duplications of identical studies gathered from multiple sources were removed.\u202fData extraction procedures were managed in EPPI-Reviewer software. Information on study type, population, behaviours measured and determinants measured were extracted. We appraised the methodological quality of systematic reviews with AMSTAR-2. We did not appraise the quality of primary studies in this map.\nMAIN RESULTS: As of 1 June 2022 the EGM includes 1034 records reporting on 860 cross-sectional, 68 longitudinal, 78 qualitative, 25 reviews, 62 interventional, and 39 other studies (e.g., mixed-methods approaches). The map includes studies that measured social distancing (n\u2009=\u2009487), masks and face coverings (n\u2009=\u2009382), handwashing (n\u2009=\u2009308), physical distancing (n\u2009=\u2009177), isolation/quarantine (n\u2009=\u2009157), respiratory hygiene/etiquette (n\u2009=\u200975), cleaning surfaces (n\u2009=\u200959), and avoiding touching the T-zone (n\u2009=\u200948). There were 333 studies that assessed composite measures of two or more behaviours. The largest cluster of determinants was 'demographics' (n\u2009=\u2009730 studies), followed by 'cognition' (n\u2009=\u2009496 studies) and determinants categorised as 'other' (n\u2009=\u2009447). These included factors such as 'beliefs', 'culture' and 'access to resources'. Less evidence is available for some determinants such as 'interventions' (n\u2009=\u200999 studies), 'information' (n\u2009=\u2009101 studies), and 'behaviour' (149 studies).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This EGM provides a valuable resource for researchers, policy-makers and the public to access the available evidence on the determinants of various COVID-19 health-related behaviours. The map can also be used to help guide research commissioning, by evidence synthesis teams and evidence intermediaries to inform policy during the ongoing pandemic and potential future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other respiratory infections. Evidence included in the map will be explored further through a series of systematic reviews examining the strength of the associations between malleable determinants and the uptake and maintenance of individual protective behaviours."

            "title": "Combined Infection Control Interventions Protect Essential Food Workers from Occupational Exposures to SARS-CoV-2 in the Agricultural Environment.",
            "abstract": "Essential food workers experience elevated risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to prolonged occupational exposures in food production and processing areas, shared transportation (car or bus), and employer-provided shared housing. Our goal was to quantify the daily cumulative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for healthy susceptible produce workers and to evaluate the relative reduction in risk attributable to food industry interventions and vaccination. We simulated daily SARS-CoV-2 exposures of indoor and outdoor produce workers through six linked quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) model scenarios. For each scenario, the infectious viral dose emitted by a symptomatic worker was calculated across aerosol, droplet, and fomite-mediated transmission pathways. Standard industry interventions (2-m physical distancing, handwashing, surface disinfection, universal masking, ventilation) were simulated to assess relative risk reductions from baseline risk (no interventions, 1-m distance). Implementation of industry interventions reduced an indoor worker's relative infection risk by 98.0% (0.020; 95% uncertainty interval [UI], 0.005 to 0.104) from baseline risk (1.00; 95% UI, 0.995 to 1.00) and an outdoor worker's relative infection risk by 94.5% (0.027; 95% UI, 0.013 to 0.055) from baseline risk (0.487; 95% UI, 0.257 to 0.825). Integrating these interventions with two-dose mRNA vaccinations (86 to 99% efficacy), representing a worker's protective immunity to infection, reduced the relative infection risk from baseline for indoor workers by 99.9% (0.001; 95% UI, 0.0002 to 0.005) and outdoor workers by 99.6% (0.002; 95% UI, 0.0003 to 0.005). Consistent implementation of combined industry interventions, paired with vaccination, effectively mitigates the elevated risks from occupationally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection faced by produce workers. IMPORTANCE This is the first study to estimate the daily risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across a variety of indoor and outdoor environmental settings relevant to food workers (e.g., shared transportation [car or bus], enclosed produce processing facility and accompanying breakroom, outdoor produce harvesting field, shared housing facility) through a linked quantitative microbial risk assessment framework. Our model has demonstrated that the elevated daily SARS-CoV-2 infection risk experienced by indoor and outdoor produce workers can be reduced below 1% when vaccinations (optimal vaccine efficacy, 86 to 99%) are implemented with recommended infection control strategies (e.g., handwashing, surface disinfection, universal masking, physical distancing, and increased ventilation). Our novel findings provide scenario-specific infection risk estimates that can be utilized by food industry managers to target high-risk scenarios with effective infection mitigation strategies, which was informed through more realistic and context-driven modeling estimates of the infection risk faced by essential food workers daily. Bundled interventions, particularly if they include vaccination, yield significant reductions (&gt;99%) in daily SARS-CoV-2 infection risk for essential food workers in enclosed and open-air environments."

            "abstract": "The environmental stability of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) on the surface of human skin and the effectiveness of disinfectant against HCoV-OC43, which are important to prevent contact transmission, have not been clarified in previous studies. Using previously generated models, we evaluated HCoV-OC43 stability and disinfection effectiveness. Then we compared the results with those for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The median survival time of HCoV-OC43 on the surface of human skin was 24.6 h (95% confidence interval, 19.7 to 29.6 h), which was higher than that of SARS-CoV-2 (10.8 h). Although the in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that HCoV-OC43 has a higher ethanol resistance than SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was completely inactivated by a minimum of 50% ethanol within 5 s (the log reduction values were &gt;4.0). Moreover, 1.0% chlorhexidine gluconate and 0.2% benzalkonium chloride showed relatively high disinfectant effectiveness, and the log reduction values when these disinfectants were applied for 15 s were &gt;3.0. HCoV-OC43 is highly stable on the skin surface, which may increase the risk of contact transmission. Although HCoV-OC43 has relatively high ethanol resistance, appropriate hand hygiene practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants sufficiently reduce the risk of contact transmission. IMPORTANCE This study revealed the environmental stability of HCoV-OC43 and disinfectant effectiveness against HCoV-OC43, which had not been demonstrated in previous studies. HCoV-OC43 is highly stable on the surface of human skin, with a survival time of approximately 25 h. High stability of HCoV-OC43 may increase the risk of contact transmission. Furthermore, the in vitro disinfectant effectiveness evaluation showed that HCoV-OC43, which is classified as an envelope virus, has a relatively high ethanol resistance. This finding suggests that disinfectant effectiveness may vary greatly depending on the virus and that each virus targeted for infection control should be evaluated individually. HCoV-OC43 on the skin surface was rapidly inactivated by 50% ethanol, which suggests that appropriate hand hygiene practices with current alcohol-based disinfectants can sufficiently reduce the risk of HCoV-OC43 contact transmission."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, healthcare workers (HCW) have relied on reusable personal protective equipment (PPE), including respirators and face shields (FSs). The effectiveness of decontamination procedures outside experimental settings is unclear. We examined the prevalence of surface contamination on reusable PPE used by HCWs at a hospital incorporating daily centralized decontamination and post-use wiping by sampling for common pathogens.\nMETHOD: Samples were collected from HCWs' CleanSpace Halo respirator face masks (FMs) and FSs at the start of shift, immediately after use, and after cleaning with disinfecting wipes. Samples were analyzed for pathogens using the Applied Biosystems\u2122 TaqPath\u2122 COVID-19 Combo Kit and ThermoFisher TaqMan Array Card. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical correlation.\nFINDINGS: Of the 89 samples, 51 from FMs and 38 from FSs, none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, despite 58 being obtained from PPE used in the care of patients with COVID-19, many with recent aerosol-generating procedures. Four samples tested positive (4.5%) for Staphylococcus aureus, two each from FMs and FSs. FMs that tested positive were not worn concurrently with FSs that tested positive. The FM and FS samples testing positive were worn in the care of patients without diagnosed S. aureus infection. No FMs tested positive following wipe-based disinfection, but both positive FS samples were found after disinfection wiping.\nCONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Contamination of reusable PPE appears uncommon, especially with SARS-CoV-2, when regular decontamination programs are in place. The rare presence of S. aureus highlights the importance of doffing procedures and hand hygiene by HCW to prevent surface contamination."

Besides the high transmission rate from individual to individual, indirect transmission from inanimate objects or surfaces poses a more significant threat. Since the start of the outbreak, the importance of respiratory protection, social distancing, and chemical disinfection to prevent the spread of the virus has been the prime focus for infection control. Health regulatory organizations have produced guidelines for the formulation and application of chemical disinfectants to manufacturing industries and the public. On the other hand, extensive literature on the virucidal efficacy testing of microbicides for SARS-CoV-2 has been published over the past year and a half. This review summarizes the studies on the most common chemical disinfectants and their virucidal efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, including the type and concentration of the chemical disinfectant, the formulation, the presence of excipients, the exposure time, and other critical factors that determine the effectiveness of chemical disinfectants. In this review, we also critically appraise these disinfectants and conduct a discussion on the role they can play in the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "abstract": "Covid-19 is a dreadful pandemic of the 21st century that has created fear among people, affected the whole world, and taken thousands of lives. It infects the respiratory system and causes flu-type symptoms. According to the WHO reports, 2,082,745 deaths and 96,267,473 confirmed cases were perceived all around the globe till January 22, 2021. The significant roots of transmission are inhalation and direct contact with the infected surface. Its incubation period is 2-14 days and remains asymptomatic in most people. However, no treatment and vaccine are available for the people, so preventive measures like social distancing, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), and frequent hand-washing are the practical and only options for cure. It has affected every sector of the world, whether it is trade or health all around the world. There is high demand for diagnostic tools as high-scale and expeditious testing is crucial for controlling disease spread; thus, detection methods play an essential role. Like flu, Covid-19 is also detected through RT-PCR, as the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested, but it is time taking and expensive method that many countries cannot afford. A vaccine is a crucial aspect of eradicating disease, and for SARS-CoV-2), plasma therapy and antibiotics therapy are used in the early spreading phase. The later stage involves forming a vaccine based on spike protein, N-protein, and whole-viral antigen that effectively immunizes the population worldwide until herd immunity can be achieved. In this review, we will discuss all possible and developed techniques for identifying SARS-CoV-2 and make a comparison of their specificity, selectivity, and cost; thus, we choose an appropriate method for fast, reliable, and pocket-friendly detection."

            "abstract": "Hand hygiene is among the most fundamental and widely used behavioural measures to reduce the person-to-person spread of human pathogens and its effectiveness as a community intervention is supported by evidence from randomized trials. However, a theoretical understanding of the relationship between hand hygiene frequency and change in risk of infection is lacking. Using a simple model-based framework for understanding the determinants of hand hygiene effectiveness in preventing viral respiratory tract infections, we show that a crucial, but overlooked, determinant of the relationship between hand hygiene frequency and risk of infection via indirect transmission is persistence of viable virus on hands. If persistence is short, as has been reported for influenza, hand-washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination to substantially reduce the probability of infection. When viable virus survival is longer (e.g. in the presence of mucus or for some enveloped viruses) less frequent hand washing can substantially reduce the infection probability. Immediate hand washing after contamination is consistently more effective than at fixed-time intervals. Our study highlights that recommendations on hand hygiene should be tailored to persistence of viable virus on hands and that more detailed empirical investigations are needed to help optimize this key intervention."

            "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV2 in 2019 showed again that the world's healthcare system is not fully equipped and well-designed for preventing the transmission of nosocomial respiratory infections. One of the great tools for preventing the spread of infectious organisms in hospitals is the anteroom. Several articles have investigated the role of the anteroom in disease control but the lack of a comprehensive study in this field prompted us to provide more in-depth information to fill this gap. Also, this study aimed to assess the necessity to construct an anteroom area for hospital staff members at the entrance of each ward of the hospital, and specify the equipment and facilities which make the anteroom more efficient. Articles were identified through searches of Scopus, Web of Sciences, PubMed, and Embase for studies published in English until May 2020 reporting data on the effect of the anteroom (vestibule) area in controlling hospital infections. Data from eligible articles were extracted and presented according to PRISMA's evidence-based data evaluation search strategy. Also, details around the review aims and methods were registered with the PROSPERO. From the database, 209 articles were identified, of which 25 studies met the study criteria. Most studies demonstrated that an anteroom significantly enhances practical system efficiency. The results showed that the equipment such as ventilation system, high-efficiency particulate absorption filter, hand dispensers, alcohol-based disinfection, sink, mirror, transparent panel, UVC disinfection, and zone for PPE change, and parameters like temperature, door type, pressure, and size of the anteroom are factors that are effective on the safety of the hospital environment. Studies demonstrated that providing an anteroom for changing clothing and storing equipment may be useful in reducing the transmission of airborne infections in hospitals. Since the transmission route of SARS-CoV2 is common with other respiratory infectious agents, it can be concluded that a well-designed anteroom could potentially decrease the risk of SARS-CoV2 transmission during hospitalization as well."

Here, we review environmental factors that control viral transmission, such as air, temperature, humidity, food, water and sewage, insects, inanimate surfaces, hand hygiene, and social distancing. The main route of viral transmission is the respiratory tract through aerosols. Masks and social distancing are effective in ceasing air transmission. Proper cleaning of surfaces and hand disinfection are required, especially in healthcare units. Food should be handled properly, and food handlers should work based on hygienic protocols. Water and sewage transmission, and transmission through insects appear less important than other environmental factors."

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3\u200adays (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4\u200adays) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1\u200adays (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9\u200adays). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9\u200adays (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0\u200adays) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4\u200adays (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8\u200adays). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes.\u00a0 SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community.\u00a0 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention.\u00a0 We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in\u00a0transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in\u00a0transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects.\u00a0\u00a0 As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review."

            "abstract": "Handwashing is essential for respiratory virus prevention, but uptake of handwashing in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic remains under-explored. This study examines trends in and determinants of handwashing practices for COVID-19 prevention in 10 countries in West, East, and Southern Africa. Data are derived from an online global Facebook survey assessing COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices, fielded in July (Round 1) and November 2020 (Round 2). Adults \u226518 years (N = 29,964) were asked if they practiced handwashing with soap and water in the past week to prevent COVID-19. Design-corrected F-statistics compared knowledge and practice of handwashing, at country and regional levels, between survey rounds. A country-level fixed-effects logistic regression model then identified socio-demographic and ideational correlates of handwashing at Round 2. Most participants were >30 years-old, men, post-secondary educated, and urban residents. Between survey rounds, handwashing prevalence declined significantly across regions and in each country, from a 14% decline (\u039484%-70%) in Tanzania to a 3% decline (\u039492%-89%) in South Africa. Handwashing was higher among participants aged >30 years (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.15-1.35) and with post-secondary education (aOR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.49-1.77) but lower among men (aOR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64-0.78). Ideational factors associated with handwashing included perceived effectiveness of handwashing (aOR = 2.17, 95%CI: 2.00-2.36), knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 (aOR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.18-1.40), and perceived importance of personal action for COVID-19 prevention (aOR = 2.93; 95%CI: 2.60-3.31). Adjusting for socio-demographic and ideational factors, country-level marginal probabilities of handwashing ranged from 67% in Tanzania to 91% in South Africa in Round 2. COVID-19 prevention messages should stress the importance of handwashing, coupled with mask use and physical distancing, for mitigating respiratory disease transmission. Behaviour change communications should be sensitive to resource heterogeneities in African countries, which shape opportunities for sustainable handwashing behaviours."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has caused millions of deaths worldwide. The virus is transmitted by inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air, direct deposition on mucous membranes and indirect contact via contaminated surfaces. Disinfection methods that can halt such transmission are important in this pandemic and in future viral infections.\nAIM: To highlight the efficacy of several disinfection methods against SARS-CoV-2 based on up-to-date evidence found in the literature.\nMETHODS: Two databases were searched to identify studies that assessed disinfection methods used against SARS-CoV-2. In total, 1229 studies were identified and 60 of these were included in this review. Quality assessment was evaluated by the Office of Health Assessment and Translation's risk-of-bias tool.\nFINDINGS: Twenty-eight studies investigated disinfection methods on environmental surfaces, 16 studies investigated disinfection methods on biological surfaces, four studies investigated disinfection methods for airborne coronavirus, and 16 studies investigated methods used to recondition personal protective equipment (PPE).\nCONCLUSIONS: Several household and hospital disinfection agents and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation were effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. Formulations containing povidone-iodine can provide virucidal action on the skin and mucous membranes. In the case of hand hygiene, typical soap bars and alcohols can inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Air filtration systems incorporated with materials that possess catalytic properties, UV-C devices and heating systems can reduce airborne viral particles effectively. The decontamination of PPE can be conducted safely by heat and ozone treatment."

This rapid review summarises the existing research on the determinants of behaviours that aim to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The review focuses on the body of research (excluding research conducted with health care workers) that was produced in the context of viruses other than SARS CoV-2 that cause severe respiratory illness and are transmitted in a similar way. A total of 58 published peer-reviewed studies included in the review were identified through searches of Medline, Embase, PsychInfo and CINAHL. Most were conducted in the context of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Most studies examined the determinants of wearing a face covering, handwashing and social or physical distancing. The findings suggest that public health messages to encourage preventive behaviours should emphasise the potential seriousness of COVID-19 to elicit appropriate concern, strengthen perceptions of risk or threat from COVID-19, enhance self-efficacy about preventive behaviours, and improve knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, how it is transmitted, and how preventive behaviours can reduce the risk of transmission."

VHR was defined as multiple major ASCVD events or one major event with multiple high-risk conditions. The primary outcome was a composite of 3-year CV events, including cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization.\nRESULTS: 14,475 (54.1 %) patients were classified as VHR, with higher 3-year event rates than non-VHR (9.6 % vs. 7.3 %). Hemoglobin (Hb), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were significant CV risk influencers in VHR patients (hazard ratios [95 % CI]: 0.93 [0.90-0.96], 1.13 [1.06-1.21], 1.07 [1.04-1.11], 0.73 [0.61-0.89], respectively), but not in non-VHR patients.

Dynamic changes in ApoA1 levels may be associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of ApoA1 trajectories over three early assessments.\nMETHODS: Participants in the Chin-Shan Community Cardiovascular Cohort with dyslipidemia and receiving three early ApoA1 assessments were enrolled. Group-based multivariate trajectory modeling was used to classify participants into distinct trajectories after multivariable adjustment. The follow-up duration was from April 1990 to August 2022, and the long-term outcomes of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death outcomes were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,080 participants were included (median [interquartile range] age 66.14 [57.93-75.04] years, 43.2% males). Participants were classified into four ApoA1 trajectories: Trajectory 1 (low-level persistence pattern); Trajectory 2 (fall-then-rise pattern); Trajectory 3 (rise-then-fall pattern); and Trajectory 4 (elevated stable pattern). The cumulative incidence of MACE was ranked as Trajectory 4 (7.9%)\u2009<\u2009Trajectory 2 (9.3%)\u2009<\u2009Trajectory 3 (9.4%)\u2009<\u2009Trajectory 1 (12.7%). Comparing to Trajectory 4, both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 had significantly higher risks of MACE (Trajectory 1: hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20092.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-3.86; Trajectory 2: HR\u2009=\u20092.38, 95% CI 1.03-5.48). For cardiovascular death, similar results were present. There were no significant differences in composite outcome, all-cause death, non-cardiovascular death across ApoA1 trajectories.\nCONCLUSION: The trajectory changes of ApoAI levels significantly influences MACE risk during long-term follow-up, particularly in the low-stable and J-shaped trajectories. Dynamic monitoring of ApoAI may serve as a valuable tool for early risk stratification in high-risk populations, facilitating more individualised interventions."

            "abstract": "The risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease increases with advancing age. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remain predictive of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular events among individuals older than 75\u2009years. Risk prediction among older individuals is less certain because most current risk calculators lack specificity in those older than 75\u2009years and do not adjust for co-morbidities, functional status, frailty, and cognition which significantly impact prognosis in this age group. Data on the benefits and risks of lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins in older patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are also limited since most primary prevention trials have included mostly younger patients. Available data suggest that statin therapy in older primary prevention patients may reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and that benefits from lipid-lowering with statins outweigh potential risks such as statin-associated muscle symptoms and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus. While some evidence suggests the possibility that statins may be associated with incident cognitive impairment in older adults, a preponderance of literature indicates neutral or even protective statin-related cognitive effects. Shared decision-making which is recommended for all patients when considering statin therapy is particularly important in older patients. Randomized clinical trial data evaluating the use of non-statin lipid-lowering therapy in older patients are sparse. Deprescribing of lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for select patients older than 75\u2009years with life-limiting diseases. Finally, a patient-centered approach should be taken when considering primary prevention strategies for older adults."

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, increasing the capacity of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol to mediate macrophage reverse cholesterol transport has been a target of interest in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, clinical studies reporting the limited efficacy of HDL or its main apolipoprotein, APOA1, in reducing cardiovascular events have emerged. Although HDL cholesterol is unlikely to play a direct causal role in CVD, its inverse, albeit modest, association with CVD risk, consistently observed in large population studies, suggests it may influence alternative pathways beyond cholesterol metabolism. Given the diverse functions of HDL and its components, it is conceivable that its impact on CVD occurs through less direct mechanisms. A potential hypothesis is that HDL modulates platelet function, a crucial player in the initiation and progression of atherothrombosis, which may contribute to its observed relationship with CVD risk. In this review, we focus on how HDL and its components, with an emphasis on APOA1, interact with platelets (and their precursors or activation products) to modulate atherothrombotic responses."

However, the influence of obesity and related comorbidities on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles remains unclear. This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.01). Hyperlipidemia significantly increased the risk of severe CRS (OR\u2009=\u20093.730, CI [1.204-11.556], p\u2009=\u20090.022). However, being overweight, having diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or fatty liver were not significantly associated with severe CRS. Elevated total cholesterol was moderately correlated with increased Interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (R\u2009=\u20090.637, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and weakly with Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (R\u2009=\u20090.337, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Obesity and related comorbidities did not significantly impact treatment efficacy. However, hyperlipidemia was associated with an increased risk of severe CRS, emphasizing the need for tailored risk management strategies in CAR-T therapy.

The cross-sectional analysis included 7,744 samples, with 2,398 in the sarcopenia group and 5,346 in the non-sarcopenia group. In the retrospective cohort study, 1,441 participants without sarcopenia at baseline were selected and followed for the development of sarcopenia. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between AIP, BMI, and sarcopenia risk. A restricted cubic spline regression model was used to evaluate the dose-response association, and ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive ability of individual and combined indicators (AIP and BMI). Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the association between AIP, BMI, and sarcopenia risk across different demographic groups.\nRESULTS: The cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with various factors, including age, marital status, education level, residence, smoking, BMI, uric acid (UA), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), AIP, as well as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart disease (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, revealed that the low AIP group was significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia (OR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02), while no significant difference was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.01, p\u2009=\u20090.07). In the retrospective cohort study, the low AIP group showed a positive association with sarcopenia risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.79, 95% CI 1.18-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and a similar trend was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.77, p\u2009=\u20090.04). BMI was inversely associated with sarcopenia incidence, consistent with the cross-sectional findings. Both AIP and BMI showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship with sarcopenia risk, with AIP approximating a U-shaped curve and BMI approximating an L-shaped curve. Subgroup analysis indicated that, in the 65-69 age group, low AIP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia. In participants aged 70 and above, as well as in females, both low and high AIP levels were significantly associated with higher incidence risk. ROC curve analysis showed that the combined use of AIP and BMI for predicting sarcopenia had an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8913, which was moderately better than the use of AIP (0.6499) or BMI (0.8888) alone.\nCONCLUSION: The changes in AIP and BMI are associated with the risk of sarcopenia, and both provide some predictive value for sarcopenia. Taken together, the combined prediction using AIP and BMI appears to be somewhat more effective than using either indicator alone in assessing the risk of sarcopenia."

Current evidence is insufficient to establish this association, yet it holds critical importance for healthcare and public health. Research into the link between ALI and all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis remains a topic of interest.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between ALI and all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients, and explored the clinical significance of this association.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2018, involving 4502 adult participants with MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis in the United States. Data collected included age, sex, race, education, marital status, poverty-to-income ratio, alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between ALI and all-cause mortality, with follow-up through 31 December 2019, from the National Center for Health Statistics.\nRESULTS: The study found that ALI in patients was significantly negatively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality in U.S. adults with MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis. Participants with higher ALI levels had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with lower ALI levels. After full adjustment, moderate ALI levels were associated with a 42% reduced risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.81), and high ALI levels were associated with a 49% reduced risk (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73) of all-cause mortality. No significant interactions were observed in subgroup analyses (P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggested that high ALI levels are associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients. These findings may have important clinical implications for healthcare providers managing MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients, emphasizing the potential role of ALI as a prognostic marker for all-cause mortality."

Despite the availability of effective drugs, the level of control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is low, at only about 20% among high- and very high-risk patients, who often require combination lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) with a potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin) and ezetimibe. Moreover, in Poland, several million patients require concomitant lipid-lowering and antiplatelet (acetylsalicylic acid) therapy based on their risks and indications. Single pill combinations (SPCs) improve adherence to treatment as well as the achievement of therapeutic goals and allow a greater reduction in cardiovascular incidents and mortality. This expert opinion paper, endorsed by the Polish Lipid Association (PoLA), provides practical recommendations for more effective treatment of patients with indications for LLT and antiplatelet therapy using available rosuvastatin-based combination therapies (with ezetimibe or acetylsalicylic acid)."

Among HF subtypes, Prx4 remained associated with incident HF with preserved (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.05-1.53) as well as reduced ejection fraction (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.04-1.37), with no significant difference between the subtypes (p\u2009=\u20090.64).\nCONCLUSION: Circulating Prx4 associates with the risk of developing HF, both with preserved and reduced ejection fraction. Future studies should examine whether Prx4 can serve as a real-time marker of oxidative stress status."

            "abstract": "Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, with rising prevalence in China. Hypertension persists as a predominant modifiable risk factor. This study investigates MI prevalence, trends and risk factors using data from China CDC's Chronic Disease Surveillance program. Methods: Data from 258,742 participants (2021-2023) were analysed. Demographic characteristics, risk factors and gender/urban-rural disparities in MI prevalence were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression identified significant risk factors. Results: Hypertension was the leading MI risk factor (64.3%), followed by dyslipidaemia (58.6%) and smoking (42.3%). Men had higher MI prevalence than women (58.2% vs. 41.8%), and urban residents surpassed rural residents (56.7% vs. 43.3%), with significant lifestyle disparities (e.g. physical inactivity and smoking). Multivariate analysis identified age \u2265 60\u2009years (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 2.46-3.08), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking and obesity (BMI \u2265 25) as key risk factors. MI incidence increased by 3.14% nationally from 2021 to 2023. Conclusions: China's MI burden is escalating, with notable gender, age and residence disparities. Older adults and individuals with hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking or obesity face elevated risks. Hypertension contributes to nearly two-thirds of MI cases, emphasising the urgency for targeted prevention strategies, particularly in high-risk groups (hypertensive individuals, older adults and urban populations)."

Presence of NOCAD is associated with an increased risk of an unfavorable clinical outcome. Therefore, guideline-directed preventive strategies such as lipid-lowering therapy with statins are important. This study aims to assess whether visualization of personal CTA images to patients with a new diagnosis of NOCAD facilitates reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (primary endpoint), improves statin adherence, influences the perception of statin-associated side effects, and modifies the coronary atherosclerotic phenotype.\nMETHODS: The VICAD-RISK study is a Danish multicenter randomized trial including statin na\u00efve patients suspected of chronic coronary syndrome with a new diagnosis of NOCAD determined by first-line coronary CTA.

Solbinsiran, a GalNAc-conjugated small interfering RNA targeting hepatic angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), reduced triglycerides and LDL-C concentrations in a phase 1 study. This study aimed to assess the durability and efficacy of solbinsiran in reducing concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins in adults with mixed dyslipidaemia.\nMETHODS: This double-blind, parallel-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years) with mixed dyslipidaemia at 41 clinical research units across seven countries. Patients receiving moderate-intensity or high-intensity statins, and with concentrations of fasting triglycerides between 1\u00b769 mmol/L and 5\u00b764 mmol/L, LDL-C of at least 1\u00b781 mmol/L, and non-HDL cholesterol of at least 3\u00b736 mmol/L were included. Using an interactive web-response system, patients were randomly assigned (1:2:2:2) to receive either solbinsiran 100 mg, solbinsiran 400 mg, solbinsiran 800 mg, or placebo, by subcutaneous injection on days 0 and 90. Patients were followed up for at least 270 days. The primary outcome was percent change in apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentration from baseline to day 180 with solbinsiran compared with placebo, analysed under an efficacy estimand (in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). This trial is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05256654.\nFINDINGS: Of 585 patients screened, 205 patients were enrolled in the study between July 20, 2022, and March 4, 2024. Patients (111 [54%] female and 94 [46%] male; median age 57 years [IQR 49-65]) were randomly assigned to receive solbinsiran 100 mg (n=30), solbinsiran 400 mg (n=58), solbinsiran 800 mg (n=59), or placebo (n=58). At baseline, median concentrations were 111 mg/dL (IQR\u200896-130) for apoB, 2\u00b764 mmol/L (2\u00b706-3\u00b729) for triglycerides, and 3\u00b716 mmol/L (2\u00b757-3\u00b782) for LDL-C. The placebo-adjusted percent change in apoB concentration from baseline at day 180 was -2\u00b78% (95% CI -15\u00b75 to 11\u00b79; p=0\u00b769) for solbinsiran 100 mg; -14\u00b73% (-23\u00b76 to -3\u00b79; p=0\u00b70085) for solbinsiran 400 mg; and -8\u00b73% (-18\u00b73 to 2\u00b79; p=0\u00b714) for solbinsiran 800 mg. Solbinsiran administration was well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. The number of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events was 18 [60%] of 30 patients in the solbinsiran 100 mg group, 30 [52%] of 58 patients in the solbinsiran 400 mg group, 26 [44%] of 59 patients in the solbinsiran 800 mg group, and 37 [65%] of 57 patients in the placebo group.\nINTERPRETATION: Solbinsiran 400 mg reduced apoB in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and was generally well tolerated.

However, its utility in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has not been studied.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide cohort study, we enrolled 14,543 patients with T1DM between 2009 and 2015, with a median follow-up duration of 7.52 years. The primary outcome was the incidence of CVD, including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure. The secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality. The risk of CVD across the TyG index quartiles was compared using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nRESULTS: The cut-off points for the TyG quartiles were 8.46, 9.03, and 9.60. Patients in the highest TyG quartile exhibited a higher burden of cardiometabolic risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest TyG quartile group showed a significantly increased risk of CVD (Composite CVD: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]\u2009=\u20091.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.62-2.00, myocardial infarction: aHR\u2009=\u20091.70;95% CI\u2009=\u20091.38-2.10, ischemic stroke: aHR\u2009=\u20092.11; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.78-2.50, heart failure: aHR\u2009=\u20091.65, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.45-1.88) and all-cause mortality (aHR\u2009=\u20091.60, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.41-1.81).\nCONCLUSIONS: A higher TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in patients with T1DM.\nRESEARCH INSIGHTS: What is currently known about this topic? 1. The TyG index is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in both patients with type 2 diabetes and the general population. What is the key research question? 1. Could the TyG index also be utilized to assess insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk in patients with type 1 diabetes? What is new? 1. In patients with type 1 diabetes, those in the higher TyG quartile showed a higher prevalence of metabolic dysfunction such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. 2. A higher TyG index in patients with type 1 diabetes was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke. How might this study influence clinical practice? 1. The TyG index, a simple and non-invasive marker composed of triglycerides and fasting glucose, could be used to identify patients with type 1 diabetes who have high insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk."

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between TG/HDL-C ratio and clinical outcomes in these patients.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort of 614 adults with new-onset HF hospitalized at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between July 2021 and December 2022 was analyzed. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular (CV) death and HF rehospitalizations within 12 months after discharge. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and Cox regression evaluated the association between TG/HDL-C ratio and MACE risk.\nRESULTS: Patients were divided into four quartiles (Quartile 1, 2,3 and 4) based on their TG/HDL-C ratios. The mean age was 68.94\u2009\u00b1\u200914.34 years, with 59.12% male. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 46.59\u2009\u00b1\u200910.89%, with 45.11% having an LVEF\u2009\u2264\u200940%. During the 12-month follow-up, 156 patients experienced MACE, comprising 18 CV deaths and 138 HF rehospitalizations. The Quartile 4 group had the highest MACE risk incidence compared to other groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). K-M analysis confirmed that the Quartile 4 group was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of MACE, HF rehospitalization, and CV death (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). RCS analysis revealed a positive nonlinear relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and MACE risk (P for nonlinear\u2009=\u20090.026), with a sharp risk increase above a ratio of 1.08. After adjustment, TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with MACE (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29-1.60). Compared to Quartile 1, adjusted HRs were significantly higher in Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 (all P\u2009<\u20090.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TG/HDL-C ratio is independently associated with 12-month MACE risk in new-onset HF patients. It may serve as a simple, cost-effective marker to improve early risk stratification and guide closer monitoring and tailored management in this high-risk population."

The overall concordance rate was 62.9%, the negative discordance rate was 20.4%, and the positive discordance rate was 16.7%. Sex, albuminuria status, smoking, retinal laser photocoagulation, HbA1c, HDL cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and insulin dose per kilogram contributed to the discordance. Both SCysC and eGFRcys were associated with the incidence of moderate albuminuria, whereas eGFRcr was not. Discordant eGFRcys and eGFRcr values were common in individuals with T1D.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest SCysC may facilitate early identification of individuals at risk for albuminuria."

While lipid-lowering therapies are the cornerstone of ASCVD prevention and treatment, there are other emerging targets, including inflammation (which has been dubbed the 'residual inflammatory risk'), that can be addressed after LDL cholesterol thresholds have been reached. Research over the past 20 years has identified C-reactive protein (CRP) as a key marker of inflammation with atherosclerosis. The association of more sensitive measures of CRP (high- sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) with ASCVD risk in epidemiological studies has also led to its incorporation as a risk enhancer in primary prevention guidelines and its incorporation into risk stratification tools. While there are no formal recommendations related to measurement of hsCRP in secondary prevention, consideration should be given to an individualized approach that addresses inflammatory risk in those with major adverse cardiovascular events, despite maximal lipid-lowering therapy and well-controlled LDL cholesterol levels. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of inflammation in ASCVD, the use of hsCRP as a tool to assess residual inflammatory risk to target upstream pathways such as glucose intolerance and obesity, and to consider use of additional anti-inflammatory medications for ASCVD risk reduction. The authors provide clinical context around when to measure hsCRP in clinical practice and how to address residual inflammatory risk in ASCVD."

Therefore, the prediction of the risk of these events is important for a tailored prevention and mitigation strategy. We aimed to develop simple scores to estimate recurrent VTE and MACE risks after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in a large cohort of individuals who suffered VTE (EDITH cohort). The primary endpoints were recurrent symptomatic VTE and MACE (composite of non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiovascular death). Arterial thrombotic event (ATE) exclusively was also considered. Independent predictors of main outcomes were derived from multivariable Cox regression models. Weighted integer points based on the effect estimate of identified predictors were used to derive the final risk scores. A total of 1,999 participants (mean age: 54.78 years, 46.4% male, 43.6% unprovoked VTE) were included in the derivation cohort and 10,000 in the validation cohort (built using bootstrapping). During a median post-anticoagulation follow-up of 6.9 years, recurrent VTE occurred in 29.5% of participants and MACE in 14.8%. Independent predictors of recurrent VTE were male sex, age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, and unprovoked VTE (vs. transient risk factor-associated VTE). Independent predictors of MACE were age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The risk of recurrent VTE (moderate vs. low: hazard ratio [HR]: 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06-3.34; high vs. low: HR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.91-4.89), MACE (moderate vs. low: HR: 6.37, 95% CI: 3.19-12.69; high vs. low: HR: 12.32, 95% CI: 6.09-24.89), and ATE (based on MACE-predict risk score) increased gradually from the lowest to highest of the respective prediction risk score groups. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort with overall reasonable models' discrimination performance (recurrent VTE C-statistic: 0.62-0.63, MACE and ATE C-statistic: 0.72-0.77). Contemporary simple risk scores based on readily available clinical characteristics can reasonably predict the risk of recurrent VTE and MACE after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. These findings may influence the choice of anticoagulation strategy after the acute phase of VTE and, therefore, need confirmation by further studies."

However, the unregulated use of anticoagulants in AF remains a concern, as their efficacy and safety profiles are not yet fully understood.\nMETHODS: Data from AF patients were collected in 2013, 2018, and 2023. First, cross-sectional data on AF patients were gathered during each period to longitudinally evaluate long-term trends in AF characteristics and the progression of anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, predictors of non-regulated dosing of oral anticoagulants (OAC) were analyzed. Second, patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) were prospectively followed for 24 and 60 months with different NOAC doses to assess the risk of clinical outcome events and to analyze independent risk factors for clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 2825 AF patients, with 394 patients undergoing longitudinal follow-up. Paroxysmal AF (49.70%) and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (86.30%) were the most prevalent forms with advanced age being a prominent characteristic. Independent predictors of unregulated NOAC use included age, renal insufficiency, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and bleeding risk.

Age and anemia were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality, while renal insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of composite endpoint events.\nCONCLUSION: AF remains a major disease burden, especially in elderly patients. For Asians, NOAC underdosing was still effective in preventing stroke, but its efficacy and safety need to be further validated through larger-scale clinical trials. Meanwhile, overdosing of NOAC should be avoided.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a valuable alternative therapy to anticoagulants for stroke prevention, and a representative study has demonstrated a high rate of anticoagulant discontinuation after LAAO.\nCASE SUMMARY: LAAO was performed on an 88-year-old woman with cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Although anticoagulant therapy was discontinued after LAAO, a follow-up image showed a thrombus in the right atrial appendage (RAA) incidentally. Anticoagulation was resumed, and no clinical events were detected during a 1-year follow-up.\nDISCUSSION: Although LAAO is an effective treatment for stroke prevention in patients with CA, this condition is associated with an increased risk of intracardiac thrombus. Therefore, discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy after LAAO should be approached by keeping in mind the possibility of RAA thrombus.\nTAKE-HOME MESSAGES: LAAO can be effective in CA, yet anticoagulation discontinuation must be individualized, keeping in mind the possibility of RAA thrombus in high-risk patients."

This study addresses this gap by providing key insights into anticoagulation in this high-risk population. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared to warfarin and no anticoagulation therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with CKD stage G5 or on dialysis. This scoping review followed a six-stage framework and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An exhaustive search of four databases identified relevant papers published through August 2024. The data extraction process was conducted independently, with subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses conducted. Among the 33 studies included in the final analysis, DOACs, particularly apixaban, were associated with a 20-30% decreased major bleeding risk compared to warfarin. Stroke incidence was comparable between DOACs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), with apixaban showing improved prevention in severe CKD. Observational studies reported slightly lower mortality rates with DOACs, particularly apixaban, including fewer cardiovascular-related deaths than with VKAs. DOACs, particularly apixaban and rivaroxaban, demonstrate a favorable safety profile compared to warfarin, but show inconsistent evidence in balancing thromboembolic prevention and bleeding risks in patients with AF and CKD stage G5 or on dialysis. Future studies should focus on optimizing dosing strategies and evaluating long-term safety and efficacy."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is an effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be known before the stroke (or prevalent AF) or be newly detected after stroke (post-stroke AF). Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of post-stroke AF making inflammatory markers valuable for early detection of post-stroke AF. This study investigated the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory biomarkers in predicting post-stroke AF in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with MT.\nMETHODS: This observational multicentre retrospective cohort study included 849 patients with anterior circulation LVO treated with MT across four centres from 2016 to 2023. Patients were divided into post-stroke AF and NO-AF groups, excluding those with prevalent AF. Baseline demographics, clinical and procedural variables, and inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, were collected at admission and 24 hours post-procedure. Baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability weighting (IPW). Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses assessed the predictive value of CRP for post-stroke AF.\nRESULTS: The study included 849 patients with a median age of 66 years (IQR 54-76) and 477 (56.2%) were female. Post stroke AF was detected in 186 (21.9%) patients while 663 (78.1%) did not experience AF during admission. In the weighted population CRP levels, both admission and 24 hours post-procedure, were higher in post-stroke AF patients. In logistic regression analysis admission and 24-h CRP levels were associated with increased probability of post-stroke AF, respectively (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p<0.001) and (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) following MT. We observed that the model combining age, sex, hypertension, heart failure, alcoholism, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, previous TIA and ischemic stroke and admission CRP (AUC 0.723, 95% CI 0.71-0.74) and 24h CRP (AUC 0.704, 95% CI 0.69-0.72) had good predictive accuracy, with optimal cutoff values of 4.25 for admission CRP and 14.69 for 24-h CRP to detect post-stroke AF. Subgroup analysis indicated CRP predictive relevance, particularly in hypertensive patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest CRP is associated with post-stroke AF in stroke patients due to LVO, highlighting inflammation's role in AF pathogenesis. Measuring CRP at admission and 24 hours may enable early detection and timely anticoagulation. Incorporating CRP into clinical pathways could improve individualized risk assessment, warranting further studies to validate its predictive utility and explore additional markers."

Oral anticoagulants (OACs), including direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), have been shown to reduce these risks effectively. However, the administration of OACs carries a notable risk of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a severe complication associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients with a history of ICH face a complex decision regarding the resumption of anticoagulation therapy, as the likelihood of recurrence is heightened in this population. Current literature reveals inconsistencies in research findings regarding the safety and efficacy of restarting OACs after ICH.

The comparison of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in clinical practice in elderly Asian patients has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in elderly patients with AF in conjunction with data from real-world observational studies.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study conducted in 4 centers in China, where patient information and clinical events were collected through an average of 15 months of follow-up and case queries. Clinical outcomes included major bleeding, minor bleeding, total bleeding, thrombosis, and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 3450 elderly patients with AF were enrolled. 2656 patients were treated with at least 1 NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban), and 794 patients were treated with warfarin. After correcting for confounders, NOACs significantly reduced the risk of minor bleeding [OR 0.70 (95% CL, 0.49-1.01),P\u2009=\u20090.049] and all-cause mortality [OR 0.57( 95% CI, 0.44-0.75),P\u2009<\u20090.001] compared with warfarin, however, major bleeding events [OR 1.51 (95% CL, 0.98-2.42),P\u2009=\u20090.075] and thrombotic events [OR 0.79 (95% CL, 0.57-1.13),P\u2009=\u20090.187] were not significantly different.

After the epicardial ligation of the left atrial appendage (LAA), anticoagulation can be omitted. We present the single-center procedure data and long-term data of octogenarians being treated with LARIAT\u00ae. Method: Out of 145 patients eligible for the epicardial ligation of the LAA, 45 were older than 80 y and included in this analysis. After successful ligation, patients were screened at 6 weeks of follow-up (FUP), at 12 weeks and after 12 months for transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and clinical events. During long-term FUP, TOE sessions and clinical events for embolic events and death were documented. Results: The procedure was successful in 93% of patients, with a mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASC score of 4.6 and HASBLED score of 3.7 and a mean age of 82 y. One major complication occurred, with the laceration of the LAA and surgical closure of the LAA with an Atriclip. The 6-week FUP data were available in 39 patients, with the detection of four leaks (1-3 mm, median 2 mm) and three thrombi; one thrombus occurred at the site of a leak. The 12-week FUP (in 26 patients) showed that three leaks were closed, one leak persisted and one new thrombus developed at the site of the leak. All thrombi were resolved. The 12-month FUP showed the persistent resolution of three thrombi; one thrombus recurred after the withdrawal of the anticoagulant, and no new gap or thrombus could be detected. The long-term FUP (mean 38 months) was documented in 30 patients, with no new gaps and no new thrombi; one patient suffered from a stroke, with a good long-term result of LAA closure in TOE (stroke rate 1%/y, absolute risk reduction of 4.4% to a stroke rate of 5.4% related to the score, relative CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASC risk reduction of 88%). Eleven patients died: four in the first year of ligation and seven during long-term FUP. Conclusions: The epicardial ligation of the LAA for stroke prevention in octogenarians is highly safe and effective. Early TOE FUP is crucial for the detection of thrombi and establishing an optimal anticoagulation regime. No late development of thrombi or gaps can be observed at up to 5 years."

The effect of asundexian vs apixaban was then compared on outcomes among patients who were OAC naive and OAC experienced. The study setting included 1035 sites in 38 countries, and participants were those enrolled in the OCEANIC-AF trial. Data were analyzed from June to July 2024.\nINTERVENTIONS: Asundexian, a novel factor XIa inhibitor, was compared with apixaban in patients with AF.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The main safety outcome was major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of patients in the OCEANIC-AF trial, 2493 (17%) were OAC naive (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [8.6] years; 1464 male [59%]) and 12\u202f317 (83%) were OAC experienced (mean [SD] age, 74.2 [7.5] years; 8132 male [66%]).

The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the predominant site of thrombus formation in patients with AF, making it a crucial target for stroke prevention strategies. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has emerged as an important therapeutic alternative to oral anticoagulation, particularly in patients with contraindications to long-term anticoagulant therapy. This review examines the role of LAAO in AF management, discussing current indications, patient selection, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. We also explore the latest evidence from major clinical trials and real-world studies, highlighting the efficacy and safety of LAAO compared to standard anticoagulation. Additionally, we consider the unresolved questions and the potential future directions for this intervention, including emerging technologies and the integration of LAAO into broader AF management protocols. Our review underscores the growing importance of LAAO in reducing thromboembolic risk in AF patients, particularly those unable to tolerate traditional anticoagulation, and offers insights into the ongoing evolution of this treatment modality in clinical practice."

As the population ages, clinicians are increasingly required to devise appropriate management strategies for this specific patient subgroup. These patients face not only the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant therapy but also complications due to CAA. CAA is an age-related small vessel disease characterized by the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. This condition progressively weakens the vascular integrity, thereby increasing the risk of major bleeding events. The lack of randomized clinical trials necessitates a multiparametric and multidisciplinary approach to assess the extent of vasculopathy and balance thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, aiming to tailor the most effective management strategy for each patient. In managing such cases, it is crucial to address concomitant risk factors and consider both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as left atrial appendage occlusion, to mitigate the risk of stroke."

NOAF was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-4.71), heart failure (HR 4.29, 95% CI 2.81-6.55), cardiogenic shock (HR 4.30, 95% CI 2.28-8.13), in-stent thrombosis (HR 6.04, 95% CI 1.71-21.45), and major bleeding (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.44-5.66) during hospitalization. Meta-analysis found that NOAF had a higher risk of in-hospital stroke (odds ratio 3.33, 95% CI 1.73-6.43). In-hospital use of anticoagulants was associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality but similar rates of major bleeding in NOAF patients.\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests NOAF following PCI is uncommon but associated with poor in-hospital prognosis. Findings support the use of anticoagulants in these patients during hospitalization."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a concern in patients with atrial fibrillation despite the efficacy of oral anticoagulants. Left atrial appendage closure has emerged as a treatment option for patients with suboptimal pharmacological therapy.\nOBJECTIVES: This retrospective multicenter study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of left atrial appendage occlusion procedures for two different indications. Short-term outcomes between two different methods of general anesthesia during the procedures were also compared.\nMETHODS: The study included patients who underwent appendage closure between September 2017 and June 2021. Two indications for the procedures, anticoagulant intolerance, and anticoagulant inadequacy were recorded. One-year outcomes were analyzed between groups. Short-term outcomes were compared between the intravenous general anesthesia with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and intubated general anesthesia groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 75 consecutive patients were enrolled: 19 patients in the anticoagulant inadequacy group and 56 in the anticoagulant intolerance group. Appendage occlusion was effective in reducing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients with suboptimal pharmacological therapy. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the two indication groups. Appendage closure under high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was found to be feasible and safe, with comparable results to intubated general anesthesia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Appendage occlusion is effective and safe for Taiwan National Health Insurance-approved indications, with no difference between indication groups during 1-year of follow-up. Appendage occlusion under high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy is feasible and comparable to intubated general anesthesia. Larger randomized studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings."

Balancing the benefits and risks of anticoagulant therapy and determining the optimal timing for initiation are critical. This real-world study investigated optimal timing for OAC initiation post-IS and evaluated drug selection using data from the National Health and Medical Big Data (Eastern) Center, covering IS records from 1564 hospitals in Jiangsu (2018-2021). Using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) and Cox model analysis, we compared outcomes between OAC initiators and non-initiators at different time points. Results showed that initiating OAC within 3 days for mild IS (HR, 0.82 [95\u00a0\u200b% CI, 0.71-0.94, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.024]), within 6 days for moderate IS (HR, 0.76 [95\u00a0\u200b% CI, 0.65-0.89, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.004]), and within 11 days for severe IS (HR, 0.89 [95\u00a0\u200b% CI, 0.78-0.97, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.032]) was associated with better outcomes. New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) demonstrated favorable effectiveness and safety profiles compared to warfarin, without increasing bleeding risk (HR, 0.85 [95\u00a0\u200b% CI, 0.73-0.98, p\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.038]).

Patients were divided into two groups: on-label standard dose (5\u00a0mg twice daily) and off-label reduced dose (2.5\u00a0mg twice daily). The primary effectiveness outcome was stroke/systemic embolism (SSE), and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Of 1\u2009944 patients (mean age 74.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9 years, 56% women), 997 (51%) were receiving off-label reduced dose apixaban. The off-label reduced dose group was older, had more comorbidities, higher concomitant antiplatelet use, and higher CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. During follow-up (1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 year), crude incidence rates were 0.9\u00a0vs. 0.7 per 100 person-years for SSE and 0.5\u00a0vs. 1.0 for major bleeding in the on-label vs. off-label groups. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, the off-label reduced dose group showed no significant differences in the risk of SSE (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.28-1.59, p\u00a0=\u00a00.370) and major bleeding (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.44-4.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.578) compared to the on-label standard dose group.\nCONCLUSION: In Korean patients with AF meeting a single dose reduction criterion of apixaban, off-label reduced-dose apixaban showed no significant differences in SSE and major bleeding compared to the on-label standard dose. These findings suggest that individualized anticoagulation strategies, such as reduced dose apixaban, may be beneficial for patients with a high risk of bleeding."

A comprehensive search adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted across five databases, identifying eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the last five years. The included studies examined diverse populations, ranging from pediatric to elderly CKD patients, with interventions tailored to specific subgroups, including those with proteinuria or diabetic kidney disease. Key outcomes assessed included changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria reduction, cardiovascular events, and treatment-related adverse effects. Findings highlighted the superiority of ACEis and ARBs in reducing proteinuria and slowing CKD progression, particularly in proteinuric patients, while CCBs were effective in blood pressure control and improving cardiovascular parameters. However, no head-to-head trials directly comparing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (ACEis/ARBs) and CCBs were identified, limiting definitive conclusions regarding their relative efficacy. Limitations such as small sample sizes and short follow-up durations were also noted in some studies. This review underscores the importance of individualized therapy based on patient-specific factors to optimize renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Further research is recommended to explore long-term outcomes and combination therapies in this population."

The primary endpoint was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after 6 months.\nRESULTS: This study included a total of 364 patients with DKD, 153 (42.0%) of whom were female. The median disease duration was 8.0 years, and the mean values of age, HbA1c level, body mass index, and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were 52.1 years, 8.6%, 27.8 kg/m2, and 88.0 mg/g, respectively. Additionally, 73.6% and 26.4% of patients had mild and moderate DKD, respectively.

            "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it heightens the risk of cardiovascular incidents. The pathogenesis of DKD is thought to involve hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic factors that converge on the fibrotic pathway. Genetic predisposition and unhealthy lifestyle practices both play a significant role in the development and progression of DKD. In spite of the recent emergence of angiotensin receptors blockers (ARBs)/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists (NS-MRAs), current therapies still fail to effectively arrest the progression of DKD. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), a promising class of agents, possess the potential to act as renal protectors, effectively slowing the progression of DKD. Other agents, including pentoxifylline (PTF), selonsertib, and baricitinib hold great promise as potential therapies for DKD due to their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. Multidisciplinary treatment, encompassing lifestyle modifications and drug therapy, can effectively decelerate the progression of DKD. Based on the treatment of heart failure, it is recommended to use multiple drugs in combination rather than a single-use drug for the treatment of DKD. Unearthing the mechanisms underlying DKD is urgent to optimize the management of DKD. Inflammatory and fibrotic factors (including IL-1, MCP-1, MMP-9, CTGF, TNF-a and TGF-\u03b21), along with lncRNAs, not only serve as diagnostic biomarkers, but also hold promise as therapeutic targets. In this review, we delve into the potential mechanisms and the current therapies of DKD. We also explore the additional value of combing these therapies to develop novel treatment strategies. Drawing from the current understanding of DKD pathogenesis, we propose HIF inhibitors, AGE inhibitors, and epigenetic modifications as promising therapeutic targets for the future."

The aim of this analysis is to compare drug treatments of DKD by means of a systemic review and a network meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: We searched Medline, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov for randomized, controlled studies including adults with DKD treated with the following drugs of interest: single angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor-blocker (single ACEi/ARB), angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor-blocker combination (ACEi+ARB combination), aldosterone antagonists, direct renin inhibitors, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonists (nsMRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). As primary endpoints, we defined: overall mortality and end-stage kidney disease, as secondary endpoints: renal composite outcome and albuminuria and as safety endpoints: acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia and hypotension. Under the use of a random effects model, we computed the overall effect estimates using the statistic program R4.1 and the corresponding package \"netmeta\". Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and the quality of evidence of each pairwise comparison was rated according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\nRESULTS: Of initial 3489 publications, 38 clinical trials were found eligible, in total including 42346 patients. Concerning the primary endpoints overall mortality and end stage kidney disease, SGLT2i on top of single ACEi/ARB compared to single ACEi/ARB was the only intervention significantly reducing the odds of mortality (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.70-0.95) and end-stage kidney disease (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.54-0.88). The indirect comparison of nsMRA vs SGLT2i in our composite endpoint suggests a superiority of SGLT2i (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.47-0.76). Concerning safety endpoints, nsMRA and SGLT2i showed benefits compared to the others.\nCONCLUSIONS: As the only drug class, SGLT2i showed in our analysis beneficial effects on top of ACEi/ARB treatment regarding mortality and end stage kidney disease and by that reconfirmed its position as treatment option for diabetic kidney disease. nsMRA reduced the odds for a combined renal endpoint and did not raise any safety concerns, justifying its application."

Since the 1990s, specific therapies have emerged and been approved to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease, namely, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (NS-MRA), finerenone, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors).

The present study examined if controlling hyperglycemia with empagliflozin, or given in combination with lisinopril, slows the progression of renal injury in hypertensive diabetic rats. Studies were performed using hypertensive streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic Dahl salt-sensitive (STZ-SS) rats and in deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertensive type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) rats. Administration of empagliflozin alone or in combination with lisinopril reduced blood glucose, proteinuria, glomerular injury, and renal fibrosis in STZ-SS rats without altering renal blood flow (RBF) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Blood pressure and renal hypertrophy were also reduced in rats treated with empagliflozin and lisinopril. Administration of empagliflozin alone or in combination with lisinopril lowered blood glucose, glomerulosclerosis, and renal fibrosis but had no effect on blood pressure, kidney weight, or proteinuria in hypertensive T2DN rats. RBF was not altered in any of the treatment groups, and GFR was elevated in empagliflozin-treated hypertensive T2DN rats.

No specific treatment of the underlying condition is available for the majority of patients, but ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARB) slows progression in albuminuric CKD. Adding a mineralocorticoid receptor-antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone has an additive effect. However, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade increases the risk of hyperkalaemia which is exacerbated by the presence of CKD. Thus, hyperkalaemia may prevent optimal use of RAAS-blockade in some patients.This project hypothesises that adding a potassium binder (patiromer) allows for improved RAAS-blockade including the use of MRA, thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment is limited by hyperkalaemia.If successful, the study may lead to improved treatment of this subgroup of patients with CKD. Furthermore, the study will examine the feasibility of potassium binders in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open-label, randomised controlled trial including 140 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25-60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2, a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) &gt;500\u2009mg/g (or 200\u2009mg/g if diabetes mellitus) and a current or two previous plasma-potassium &gt;4.5\u2009mmol/L. Patients who develop hyperkaliaemia &gt;5.5\u2009mmol/L during a run-in phase, in which RAAS-blockade is intesified with the possible addition of spironolactone, are randomised to 12-month treatment with maximal tolerated ACE-I/ARB and spironolactone with or without patiromer.The primary endpoint is the difference in UACR measured at randomisation and 12 months compared between the two groups. Secondary endpoints include CKD progression, episodes of hyperkalaemia, blood pressure, eGFR, markers of cardiovascular disease, diet and quality of life.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (REFNO 1-10-72-110-20) and is registered in the EudraCT database (REFNO 2020-001595-15).

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of sGC stimulator Compound 1 on the renal effect in obese ZSF1 (ZSF1 OB) rats.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The sGC stimulator Compound 1, the standard of care agent Enalapril, and a combination of Compound 1 and Enalapril were administered chronically to obese ZSF1 rats for 6 months.

In the last 20\u00a0years, the only agents to show a reduction in the risk of CKD progression in patients with and without type\u00a02 diabetes (T2D) were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, but neither drug class has provided a decreased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and evidence for their use in patients with CKD without T2D is relatively limited.

Despite the introduction of these therapeutics, an important residual risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular death remains in patients with T2D. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are a promising therapeutic option in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) owing to the reported effects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in inflammatory cells, podocytes, fibroblasts, mesangial cells and vascular cells. In preclinical studies, MRAs consistently reduce albuminuria, CKD progression, and activation of fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. DKD clinical studies have similarly demonstrated that steroidal MRAs lead to albuminuria reduction compared with placebo, although hyperkalaemia is a major secondary effect. Non-steroidal MRAs carry a lower risk of hyperkalaemia than steroidal MRAs, and the large FIDELIO-DKD clinical trial showed that the non-steroidal MRA finerenone also slowed CKD progression and reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo in patients with T2D. Encouragingly, other non-steroidal MRAs have anti-albuminuric properties in DKD. Whether or not combining MRAs with other renoprotective drugs such as SGLT2 inhibitors might provide additive protective effects warrants further investigation."

            "abstract": "The therapeutic options for preventing or slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been thus far limited. While angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are, without a doubt, safe and effective drugs, a significant proportion of patients with CKD still progress to end-stage kidney disease. After decades of negative trials, nephrologists have finally found cause for optimism with the introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). Recent trials such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CREDENCE have provided evidence of the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, which have now found widespread acceptance as first-line agents for diabetic CKD, in addition to ACEi/ARBs. Considering results from the DAPA-CKD study, it is expected that their use will soon be expanded to other causes of albuminuric CKD as well, although confirmation from further trials, such as the EMPA-KIDNEY study is awaited. Likewise, although the role of mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation in CKD progression has been known for decades, it is only now with the FIDELIO-DKD study that we have evidence of benefits of MRAs on hard renal endpoints, specifically in patients with diabetic CKD. While further research is ongoing, given the evidence of synergism between the three drug classes, it is foreseeable that a combination of two or more of these drugs may soon become the standard of care for CKD, regardless of underlying aetiology. This review describes pathophysiologic mechanisms, current evidence and future perspectives on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and novel MRAs in CKD."

            "abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors immediately reduce the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. When given chronically, they confer benefit by markedly slowing the rate at which chronic kidney disease progresses and are the first agents to do so since the advent of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Salutary effects on the kidney were first demonstrated in cardiovascular outcomes trials and have now emerged from trials enriched in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. A simple model that unifies the immediate and long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function is based on the assumption that diabetic hyperfiltration puts the kidney at long-term risk and evidence that hyperfiltration is an immediate response to a reduced signal for tubuloglomerular feedback, which occurs to the extent that SGLT2 activity mediates a primary increase in sodium and fluid reabsorption by the proximal tubule. This model will likely continue to serve as a useful description accounting for the beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the diabetic kidney, similar to the hemodynamic explanation for the benefit of ACEIs and ARBs. A more complex model will be required to incorporate positive interactions between SGLT2 and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 in the proximal tubule and between sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) and nitric oxide synthase in the macula densa. The implication of these latter nuances for day-to-day clinical medicine remains to be determined."

New therapies or drug combinations will be required to further slow or halt disease progression. Inhibition of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) aimed at enhancing ECM degradation has shown therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy. Here, using a mouse model of type diabetes, the maximally therapeutic dose of the PAI-1-neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (MEDI-579) was determined and compared with the maximally effective dose of enalapril. We then examined whether addition of MEDI-579 to enalapril would enhance the efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Untreated uninephrectomized diabetic db/db mice developed progressive albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis associated with increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, PAI-1, type IV collagen, and fibronectin from weeks 18 to 22, which were reduced by MEDI-579 at 3 mg/kg body wt, similar to enalapril given alone from weeks 12 to 22 Adding MEDI-579 to enalapril from weeks 18 to 22 resulted in further reduction in albuminuria and markers of renal fibrosis. Renal plasmin generation was dramatically reduced by 57% in diabetic mice, a decrease that was partially reversed by MEDI-579 or enalapril given alone but was further restored by these two treatments given in combination. Our results suggest that MEDI-579 is effective in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice and that the effect is additive to ACEI. While enalapril is renal protective, the add-on PAI-1 antibody may offer additional renoprotection in progressive diabetic nephropathy via enhancing ECM turnover."

            "abstract": "Medications that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are a cornerstone of diabetic nephropathy treatment. These agents play an important role in slowing the nephropathy progression in patients with diabetes. Clinical outcome trials that investigated use of these drug classes in patients with diabetic nephropathy have demonstrated clinical significant benefit in slowing nephropathy progression only in people with >300 mg/day of proteinuria. Thus, guidelines mandate their use in such patients. Conversely, combinations of RAAS blocking agents in these patients can worsen renal outcomes. Moreover, use of RAAS blockers in patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is limited by hyperkalemia. New agents that predictably bind excess potassium in the colon offer the possibility of extending RAAS inhibitor use in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) to allow evaluation of RAAS blockade for nephropathy and cardiovascular outcomes. These new potassium-binding agents may provide an opportunity to continue full-dose RAAS inhibition and assess if the benefits of RAAS blockade seen in stage 3 CKD can be extrapolated to persons with stages 4 and 5 CKD, not previously tested due to hyperkalemia."

Multiple prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that tight blood pressure control among patients with diabetic nephropathy reduces the rates of macrovascular and microvascular complications. While randomized trials exist and support a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mm Hg for patients with nondiabetic kidney disease, there are no prospective data regarding a specific blood pressure goal on progression of diabetic nephropathy. Retrospective data analyses from trials show a linear relationship between either baseline or achieved study blood pressure and progression of nephropathy. Very high albuminuria is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy with reductions by either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy associated with slowed nephropathy progression. However, combination antihypertensive therapy, while decreasing proteinuria, augments the risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and kidney dysfunction. Given the lack of trial data for a BP goal among patients with diabetic nephropathy, prospective trials are needed to define the optimal blood pressure necessary to preserve kidney function. At present, guideline blood pressure goals of less than 140/90 mm Hg and the use of ACEi or ARB therapy for those with more than 300 mg of albuminuria are mandated."

In the United Kingdom 18-30% of chronic kidney disease cases and 44% of end-stage renal disease cases in the United States have been attributed to complications of diabetic kidney disease. Angiotensin blockade using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is the standard for slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Evidence suggests that aldosterone antagonism added to standard therapy may be beneficial.\nAIM OF REVIEW: This paper aims to explore the pathophysiological contribution of aldosterone in diabetic kidney disease and review available literature for aldosterone antagonism through mineralocorticoid receptor blockade.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted. Results were analysed and summarised.\nRESULTS: Nine trials evaluating a total of 535 patients with diabetic kidney disease were identified that evaluated the use of aldosterone antagonists for reducing the signs of diabetic kidney disease. All trials demonstrated a marked decrease in urinary protein excretion when compared to, or added to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade. The most commonly reported side effect in all of the trials was hyperkalaemia, which occurred in 6.1% of all patients evaluated. Aldosterone antagonists were generally well tolerated in the evaluated patient populations.\nCONCLUSION: Aldosterone antagonism may represent a safe and effective complimentary therapy to the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, or angiotensin receptor blockade, for slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease."

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers have been considered effective at slowing the progression of kidney function deterioration. However, these drugs cannot sufficiently halt the progression of nephropathy to the extent that is required. A low-protein diet (LPD) is believed to be a nutritional intervention that may slow kidney disease progression. In fact, preclinical animal experiments have demonstrated excellent renoprotective effects of an LPD. However, in human clinical trials, analyses of the effects of protein restriction on diabetic nephropathy have not yet revealed consistently positive outcomes of this nutritional intervention. In this review, we analyze the potential renoprotective effects of an LPD on diabetic nephropathy and summarize the outcomes of clinical trials that have systematically investigated the efficacy of an LPD in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, we discuss some potential approaches associated with nutritional interventions to combat progressive kidney disease."

The IDEA collaboration aimed to evaluate whether 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy was noninferior to 6 months. Despite failing to meet its primary endpoint, the subgroup analyses demonstrated noninferiority based on regimen and treatment duration when a risk-stratified approach was used.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the impact of the results of the IDEA collaboration, we evaluated adjuvant chemotherapy prescribing practice patterns, including planned adjuvant treatment regimen and duration from January 1, 2016, to January 31, 2021. The time period was selected to evaluate chemotherapy prescribing patterns prior to the abstract presentation of the IDEA collaboration in June 2017 and after full manuscript publication in March 2018.\nRESULTS: A total of 399 patients with stage III colon cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy were included in the analysis. A significant increasing trend for use of 3 months of adjuvant chemotherapy was observed after presentation of the IDEA abstract (P<.001). A significant change in CAPOX (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) prescribing was also observed, increasing from 14% of patients prior to presentation of the IDEA abstract to 48% after presentation (P<.001). Comparing 3 months of CAPOX with 6 months of FOLFOX (fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin), 3 months of CAPOX use also steadily increased over time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.20-1.37; P<.001). Among subgroups of interest, no differences in adoption of CAPOX were observed. The adoption of 3 months of CAPOX was similar in patients with low-risk cancer (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17-1.37) and those with high-risk cancer (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.47).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the IDEA collaboration failing to demonstrate noninferiority of 3 months' duration of adjuvant therapy compared with 6 months, the findings have influenced practice prescribing patterns, favoring CAPOX and a shorter duration of planned adjuvant treatment."

            "abstract": "The present review focusses on perioperative diagnosis and treatment of resectable colon cancer. In UICC stages associated with a higher risk of recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of the primary tumor is an established standard. While initial data also indicate the benefit of Neoadjuvant, pre-operative chemotherapy, a final evaluation is still pending. The main focus of molecular testing in the perioperative setting is the analysis of microsatellite instability, which should routinely be performed in defined subgroups. In UICC stage II without risk factors, adjuvant therapy has a limited benefit and therefore is not a preferred option. In UICC stage II with risk factors, adjuvant therapy can be performed. The approach here is based on the recommendations applicable to stage III. In UICC stage III with low risk, adjuvant chemotherapy with CAPOX for 3\u00a0months is preferentially recommended. In UICC stage III with high risk, adjuvant chemotherapy over 6 months is recommended, preferentially with FOLFOX. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is clearly associated with favorable prognosis in non-metastatic colon cancer. However, it cannot be considered a predictive factor for the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy. Specifically, recent data of the IDEA study have opened the arena for shared decision making between physicians and patients allowing to define individual treatment approaches based on common assessment of risks and benefits. After completion of perioperative treatment, structured follow-up is of great importance and should be carried out according to the recommendations of the S3 guideline."

However, oxaliplatin-induced cumulative dose-dependent neurotoxicity is a major cause of morbidity that can persist years after treatment.

We compared survivals of patients with stage II high-risk and stage III colorectal cancer with chemotherapy in different pathological markers expression, and furthermore used 458 colon adenocarcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas to verify our preliminary results. We confirmed TOPII\u03b1, EGFR and P170 may be sufficiently predictive markers to individualize chemotherapy.

However, there is considerable stage-independent variability in clinical outcome that is likely due to molecular heterogeneity. This variability underscores the need for robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers to guide therapeutic decision-making including the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the majority of CRCs develop via a chromosomal instability pathway, approximately 12-15 % have deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) which is characterized in the tumor by microsatellite instability (MSI). Tumors with the dMMR/MSI develop from a germline mutation in an MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), i.e., Lynch syndrome, or more commonly from epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 MMR gene. CRCs with dMMR/MSI status have a distinct phenotype that includes predilection for the proximal colon, poor differentiation, and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Consistent data indicate that these tumors have a better stage-adjusted survival compared to proficient MMR or microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors and may respond differently to 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy. To increase the identification of dMMR/MSI patients in clinical practice that includes those with Lynch syndrome, it is recommended that all resected CRCs to be analyzed for MMR status. Available data indicate that patients with stage II dMMR CRCs have an excellent prognosis and do not benefit from 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy which supports their recommended management by surgery alone. In contrast, the benefit of standard adjuvant chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regiment in stage III dMMR CRC patients awaits further study and therefore, all patients should be treated with standard adjuvant FOLFOX."

Although universally recommended for patients with stage III disease, there is no consensus about the survival benefit of postoperative chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer. The most recent adjuvant clinical trials have not shown any value for adding targeted agents, namely bevacizumab and cetuximab, to standard chemotherapies in stage III disease, despite improved outcomes in the metastatic setting. However, biomarker analyses of multiple studies strongly support the feasibility of refining risk stratification in colon cancer by factoring in molecular characteristics with pathologic tumor staging. In stage II disease, for example, microsatellite instability supports observation after surgery. Furthermore, the value of BRAF or KRAS mutations as additional risk factors in stage III disease is greater when microsatellite status and tumor location are taken into account. Validated predictive markers of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit for stage II or III colon cancer are lacking, but intensive research is ongoing. Recent advances in understanding the biologic hallmarks and drivers of early-stage disease as well as the micrometastatic environment are expected to translate into therapeutic strategies tailored to select patients.

The systematic review and practice guideline were externally reviewed through a mailed survey of practitioners in Ontario, Canada.\nRESULTS: Recommendations were drafted based on the available evidence and expert consensus.\nCONCLUSIONS: The routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients with stage II colon cancer is not recommended. However, a subset of patients with high-risk stage II disease should be considered for adjuvant therapy. Patients with completely resected stage III colon cancer should be offered adjuvant chemotherapy.

For the practicing clinician, the use of surrogate endpoints to appreciate the efficacy of a specific adjuvant therapy contains various challenges, in particular, in discussions with patients. It is questionable whether 3-year DFS can still be considered an appropriate predictor of OS in complex clinical scenarios with continuous change in treatment standards in the adjuvant and palliative situation.
