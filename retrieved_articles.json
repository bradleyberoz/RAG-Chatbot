            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although preoperative pain has been reported to affect postoperative quality of life and physical function in lung cancer surgery patients, its impact on postoperative pain remains unclear. This study aimed to describe the frequency and locations of preoperative pain and evaluate its impact on postoperative pain trajectories and chronic pain occurrence in a real-world setting.\nMETHODS: A prospective patient-reported outcome survey was conducted at Hitachi General Hospital. QOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 at three time points: preoperatively (Pre), 1\u00a0month postoperatively (M1), and 1\u00a0year postoperatively (Y1). Among 184 patients with complete data, chronic pain was defined as an increase of\u2009\u2265\u200910 points in the pain score from Pre to Y1.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five (30%) of the 184 patients reported experiencing pain at Pre. The pain scores (Pre:M1:Y1) of the patients without and with preoperative pain (the no-pain and pain groups, respectively) were 0: 26.4\u2009\u00b1\u200918.8:7.9\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6 and 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.1:35.8\u2009\u00b1\u200920.1:20.6\u2009\u00b1\u200920.0, respectively. Chronic pain incidence was higher in the no-pain group (39.5%) than in the pain group (20%). Predictors of chronic pain included age, living alone, and open surgical approach in the no-pain group, and heavy smoking and having work in the pain group.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative pain influences postoperative pain trajectories and chronic pain risk. Identifying preoperative pain may enhance understanding and management of postoperative pain in lung cancer surgery patients."

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and in Chile, especially among young women due to increased tobacco consumption. In Chile, the incidence and mortality of this disease have risen in recent years. Most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting treatment options to palliative care.\nAIM: characterize adult patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer at the Regional Hospital of Temuco between October 2019 and June 2023, and to analyze factors such as smoking, biomass exposure, symptoms at diagnosis, and molecular mutations.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on adult patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer at the Regional Hospital of Temuco between October 2019 and June 2023. Data was collected on biosociodemo-graphic characteristics, medical history, smoking, biomass exposure, symptoms at diagnosis, performance status, biopsy type, pathological results, and molecular mutation studies.\nRESULTS: Out of 256 patients diagnosed with lung cancer, 220 met the inclusion criteria for histo-logical confirmation. 55.3% were male, with a mean age of 68 \u00b1 9.5 years. 67.7% had a history of smoking, and 30.1% were exposed to biomass. 98.6% presented symptoms at diagnosis, with cough being the most common. The majority (81.9%) were diagnosed at advanced stages (III-IV). 63.9% of diagnoses were adenocarcinomas, with EGFR mutations found in 13.6% and ALK mutations in 2.1%. PDL-1 expression was detected in 18.8% of cases. Significant associations were found between EGFR and ALK mutations, which were more predominant in non-smokers, and between PDL-1 expression and biomass exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer primarily affects men, with a mean age at diagnosis similar to that reported in other studies. Smoking remains the main risk factor, while biomass exposure also contributes to risk in the region. Most patients were diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent subtype, with EGFR and ALK mutations found at lower rates than in other national studies. PDL-1 expression showed a significant association with bio-mass exposure and advanced stages of the disease."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported higher lung cancer incidence among groups with lower socioeconomic position (SEP). However, it is not known how this difference in lung cancer incidence between SEP groups varies across different geographical settings. Furthermore, most prior studies that assessed the association between SEP and lung cancer incidence were conducted without detailed adjustment for smoking. Therefore, we aimed to assess this relationship across world regions.\nMETHODS: In this international prospective cohort consortium study, we used data from the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3), which includes 20 prospective population cohorts from 16 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Participants were enrolled between 1985 and 2010 and followed for cancer outcomes using registry linkages and/or active follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between educational level (our primary measure of SEP, in 4 categories) and incident lung cancer using Cox proportional hazards models separately for participants with and without a smoking history. The models were adjusted for age, sex, cohort (when multiple cohorts were included), smoking duration, cigarettes per day, and time since cessation.\nFINDINGS: Among 2,487,511 participants, 53,830 developed lung cancer during a 13.5-year median follow-up (IQR\u00a0=\u00a06.5-15.0 years). Among participants with a smoking history, higher education was associated with decreased lung cancer incidence in nearly every cohort after detailed smoking adjustment. By world region, this association was observed in North America (HR per one-category increase in education [HR<sub>trend</sub>]\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-0.89), Europe (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.88-0.91), and Asia (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86-0.96), but not in the Australian study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.95-1.09). By histological subtype, education associated most strongly with squamous cell carcinoma and more weakly with adenocarcinoma (p-heterogeneity &lt; 0.0001). Among participants who never smoked, there was no association between education and lung cancer incidence in any cohort (all p-trend &gt; 0.05), except the USA Southern Community Cohort Study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.62-0.90).\nINTERPRETATION: Based on longitudinal data from 2.5 million participants from 16 countries, our findings suggest that higher educational attainment was associated with lower lung cancer risk among participants with a smoking history, but not among participants who never smoked. Limitations of our study include that cohort participants cannot fully represent the general populations of the geographical regions included, and education was the only measure of SEP consistently available across our consortium.\nFUNDING: This study was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF), and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)."

            "abstract": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendation in 2021 and the American Cancer Society (ACS) updated its LCS guidelines in 2023. Each update expanded screening eligibility criteria; thus increasing the total number of individuals eligible for lung cancer screening. However, it is not clear whether different population subgroups benefit equally from the recent updates of LCS recommendations in terms of becoming newly eligible. We identified 85,395 individuals who were between 50 and 80 years old, smoked cigarettes formerly or currently, and did not have a history of lung cancer from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys of 2022. We used descriptive analysis to illustrate the weighted proportions of newly screening eligible population among different subgroups. We also applied multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios of being newly eligible for LCS under each LCS recommendation update in 2021 and 2023. For both LCS updates, individuals who were non-Hispanic White, male, and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly more likely to become newly eligible for LCS. A significantly larger proportion of older-age individuals became newly eligible under the 2023 ACS guideline. Noticeably, both guideline updates substantially increased the population eligible for screening among males and older individuals, two groups experiencing the majority of lung cancer incidence and mortality. Results also indicate the screening eligibility criteria updates did not increase the odds ratio of being eligible among racial/ethnic minority and female subgroups."

Current screening criteria rely on smoking history and age, missing other risk factors. This study aimed to identify clinical risk factors and social determinants of health (SDoH) for enhanced risk assessment using electronic health record (EHR) data.\nMETHODS: We analyzed 410 298 patient records from the All of Us Research Program, including 9375 lung cancer cases identified through SNOMED coding. Using Logistic LASSO regression, we developed predictive models based on diagnoses grouped by body systems and their interactions.\nRESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems showed three-fold greater association with lung cancer than other systems. Brain metastasis showed the strongest association (odds ratio 5.0, 95% CI: 4.2-5.8). The final model achieved an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and 78% sensitivity in validation. Patients with documented social determinants showed 2.5-fold higher risk (95% CI: 2.1-2.9).\nCONCLUSIONS: EHR-based prediction models effectively identify lung cancer risk using readily available medical history data. These findings support expanding current screening criteria beyond traditional risk factors."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Areca nut (AN) was classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the WHO in 2003. AN has the same carcinogenic components as cigarettes, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), but its effects on interactions with genetic factors related to lung cancer have rarely been investigated.\u00a0 METHODS: Here, a propensity score-matched case\u2012control study was conducted in Hainan, which included 445 patients with lung cancer and 445 cancer-free controls. Then, the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster and their interaction effects with AN chewing and smoking on lung cancer were analyzed. In addition, we explored the associations among AN, cigarettes, and genes related to lung cancer using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).\nRESULTS: The results indicate that the CHRNA3 rs938682 (A\u2009>\u2009G) GG genotype (OR\u2009=\u20090.669, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.454\u2009~\u20090.984, P\u2009=\u20090.042) can decrease the risk of lung cancer. The CHRNB4 rs7178270 (C\u2009>\u2009G) GG genotype (OR\u2009=\u20091.729, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.168\u2009~\u20092.571, P\u2009=\u20090.006) can increase the risk of lung cancer. The CHRNA5 rs17486278 CC genotype was associated with a high risk in males, smokers, and drinkers. The CHRNA3 rs938682 GG genotype was associated with a low risk in AN chewers. The CHRNB4 rs7178270 GG genotype was associated with high risk in drinkers and AN chewers. CHRNB4 rs7178270 and AN chewing have an interaction effect on lung cancer in Hainan.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to elucidate the hidden impacts of\u00a0AN on lung cancer and provides a key evidence regarding the interactive\u00a0effects of AN and cigarettes with SNPs in nAChRs genes on lung cancer."

            "abstract": "Though indoor air pollution (IAP) is associated with elevated lung cancer risk, an integrated measure is imperative to thoroughly investigate this association. The interplay between sex and IAP on lung cancer remains unclear. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2003 to 2010, with 2871 lung cancer cases and 8019 controls. Exposures and covariates information were collected via in-person interviews using a standardized questionnaire. An integrated weighted risk score (WRS), accounting for the effect sizes of each source of IAP, was introduced. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interactions between sex and IAP by tobacco smoking status were evaluated. Environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.69), poor ventilation (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.30), and coal used for cooking (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41) were associated with lung cancer. Dose-response relationships between lung cancer and WRS were observed, with p for trend less than 0.001. aOR for individuals at the highest quartile of the WRS of IAP was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.00) compared to the lowest quartile. The associations were more profound among never-smokers than ever-smokers. Females tended to be more vulnerable to IAP, and sex interacted with IAP beyond multiplicativity on the odds scale. IAP is associated with lung cancer, with a stronger impact among never-smokers. An interaction between IAP and sex was observed. These results underscore the importance of controlling IAP, especially ETS in order to reduce the risk of lung cancer."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air fine particulate matter and tobacco smoke exposure are primary risk factors for lung cancer. However, their recent global exposure levels, attributable burden, and patterns of inequalities remain insufficiently quantified.\nMETHODS: Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, we analyzed exposure levels of air fine particulate matter (ambient and household) and tobacco smoke (active and secondhand) by age-standardized summary exposure value (ASEV). Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) were used to assess their attributable lung cancer burden globally. Temporal patterns were examined using weighted average annual percentage change (WAPC). Cross-national health inequalities were evaluated with the concentration index (CI) for ASMR and slope index of inequality (SII) for ASDR.\nRESULTS: In 2021, air fine particulate (PM2.5) exposure peaked in low socio-demographic index (SDI) countries, while tobacco exposure was highest in high-middle SDI regions. Globally, air PM2.5 contributed to 374.21 thousand (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 236.36, 520.26) lung cancer deaths [ambient: 297.60 thousand (95% UI: 183.71, 414.74); household: 76.48 thousand (95% UI: 28.6, 187.34)], whereas tobacco exposure caused 1,238.65 thousand (95% UI: 1,075.69, 1,423.12) deaths [active smoking: 1,195.80 thousand (95% UI: 1,054.67, 1,359.22); secondhand smoke: 97.91 thousand (95% UI: 11.96, 184.91)]. High-middle SDI countries and the Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania regions bore the greatest burden. The attributable burden for males exceeded that for females by approximately twofold for air PM2.5 and fivefold for tobacco exposure. The 55\u2009+\u2009age group showed disproportionately high impacts despite lower exposure. From 1990 to 2021, the ASMR attributable to air PM2.5 and tobacco exposure changed annually by -1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.48, -1.16) and -\u20090.95% (95% CI: -1.03, -0.88), respectively. The attributable ASDR also showed declining trends. Regarding translational health inequality, the air PM2.5 attributable lung cancer burden shifted from high to low SDI countries (CI: 0.05 to -0.10, SII: 31.00 to -35.50), while the tobacco-attributable burden persisted in higher SDI countries, albeit with diminishing inequalities (CI: 0.34 to 0.25, SII: 572.20 to 304.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date study provides a comprehensive perspective on air fine particulate matter and tobacco smoke exposure's impact on lung cancer burden, highlighting its widespread nature, substantial impact, unequal distribution, and preventability. The findings call for targeted interventions and global cooperation across socioeconomic levels to reduce the overall lung cancer burden in the post-pandemic era."

            "abstract": "The complex pathogenic relationships between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its usually associated comorbidities remain poorly understood. While evidence suggests that some comorbidities may directly influence the development or progression of IPF or vice versa, whether these associations are causal or arise independently due to shared risk factors, such as aging, smoking, lifestyle, and genetic susceptibility, is still uncertain. Some comorbidities, such as metabolic syndromes, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, precede the development of IPF. In contrast, others, like pulmonary hypertension or lung cancer, often become apparent after its onset or during its progression. These timing patterns suggest a directional relationship in their associations. The issue is further complicated by the fact that patients often have multiple comorbidities, which may interact and exacerbate one another, creating a vicious cycle. To clarify these correlations, some studies have used causal inference methods (e.g., Mendelian randomisation) and exploration of underlying mechanisms; however, these efforts have not yet generated conclusive insights. In this review, we provide a general overview of the relationship between IPF and its comorbidities, emphasizing the pathogenic mechanisms underlying each comorbidity, potential shared pathobiology with IPF, and, when available, causal insights from Mendelian randomisation studies."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While traditionally associated with older adults, early-onset lung cancer (EOLC) is rising, particularly in Asia, which accounts for 75.9% of global cases. Existing lung cancer screening guidelines primarily focus on older populations, which may result in missed opportunities for early detection in younger individuals. Given its distinct clinical characteristics, EOLC warrants dedicated research and targeted interventions.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize the lipidomic profiles specific to EOLC patients (aged 18-49\u202fyears) and develop a biomarker-based predictive model to improve risk assessment and early detection.\nMETHODS: The discovery and validation sets included 111 EOLC cases and 127 non-EOLC controls, all aged 18-49\u202fyears. Targeted lipidomics analysis, combined with logistic regression, was performed on plasma samples to identify differentially expressed lipids species. Clustering and pathway analyses were conducted to uncover and visualize the internal signatures of the identified lipids. Key lipids were refined using the LASSO-bootstrap regression method combined with the Boruta algorithm. A random forest model was subsequently employed to develop a robust prediction model for EOLC.\nRESULTS: A total of 843 lipids were identified, with 60 differentially expressed lipids detected, of which 33 were validated in the validation set. Cluster analysis revealed that passive smoking (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 0.97-12.11) and current smoking (OR: 15.65, 95% CI: 2.55-142.10) were associated with elevated lipid metabolite profiles in EOLC patients. The validated lipids were further refined using LASSO and Boruta methods, which ultimately selected 6 lipids for inclusion in a prediction model constructed with random forest. This model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.874 in the validation set.\nCONCLUSION: Our study identified lipidomic signatures associated with the risk of EOLC, offering potential translational implications for lung cancer prevention strategies."

Covariates were matched using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) for school cooks and clerks. Age-standardized incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for lung cancer were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Fine-Gray subdistribution HRs were used for sensitivity analysis. After further categorization into never- and ever-smoked subcohorts, the same analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: Post PSM, we identified 76 cases of lung cancer in school cooks during 259,819 person-years of follow-up. The age-standardized incidence was 199.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 120.7-278.9) and 166.8 (95% CI: 95.8-237.7) for school cooks and clerks, respectively.

            "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diabetes, as a common metabolic disorder, further increases the risk of cardiovascular damage. Studies have shown that myocardial cells in diabetic patients are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of cancer treatments, thereby raising the risk of heart failure. Therefore, cardiovascular risk assessment in lung cancer patients with diabetes is particularly important. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) is a biomarker that reflects systemic inflammation, combining the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes. It has been shown to be a significant prognostic indicator in various cancer populations. This study aims to investigate the predictive ability of IBI and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index for cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. A single-center retrospective case-control study was conducted, including clinical data of 192 lung cancer patients with diabetes who received anti-tumor therapy from July 2018 to January 2023.Cardiac injury was assessed by measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) was calculated using the formula: IBI = (C-reactive protein [CRP] \u00d7 Neutrophils)/Lymphocytes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between clinical factors, IBI, TyG index, and cardiac injury. The clinical predictive value of these factors was further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the relationship between IBI and cardiac injury was explored using the Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) model. In the 192 patients, 101 (52.6%) developed cardiac injury during follow-up. Univariate analysis showed that age, male, hypertension, smoking, D-dimer, CKMB, IBI, TNM stage: III/IV, and Immunotherapy were significantly associated with cardiac injury (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified IBI (P\u2009=\u20090.007), age (P\u2009=\u20090.01), smoking (P\u2009<\u20090.001), CKMB (P\u2009<\u20090.001), TNM stage (P\u2009=\u20090.014), and hypertension (P\u2009=\u20090.007) as independent predictors of cardiac injury. ROC analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.722 for IBI (cut-off: 8.408), indicating good predictive value. RCS analysis showed a significant nonlinear positive correlation between IBI and cardiac injury (P\u2009=\u20090.0079), with the risk of cardiac injury increasing significantly as IBI levels rose. The TyG index was not significantly associated with cardiac injury. IBI, as a simple and accessible biomarker, can effectively predict cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. Although the TyG index did not show a significant association with cardiac injury in this study, IBI demonstrated strong predictive ability in this patient group. Future studies should further validate the use of IBI across different cancer types and evaluate its prognostic role in long-term follow-up."

Model characteristics, their applications, data sources used, and limitations were extracted and narratively synthesized.\nRESULTS: From 238 publications, 69 publications were included in our review, corresponding to 22 original LC NHMs and 47 model applications. The majority of the models (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 68\u00a0%) used a microsimulation approach. NHM parameters were predominately informed by cancer registries, trial and institutional data, and literature. Model quality and performance were evaluated in 8 (36 %) models. Twenty (91\u00a0%) models included at least one carcinogenesis risk factor-primarily age, sex, and smoking history. Three (14\u00a0%) LC NHMs modeled progression in never-smokers; one (5\u00a0%) addressed recurrence. Non-tobacco smoking, nodule type, and biomarker expression were not considered in existing NHMs. Based on our findings, we proposed a framework for future LC NHM development which incorporates recurrence, nodule type differentiation, biomarker expression levels, biological factors, and non-smoking-related risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: Regular updating and future research are warranted to address limitations in existing NHMs thereby ensuring relevance and accuracy of modeling approaches in the evolving LC landscape."

Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by cumulative and average exposure groups, controlling for age, sex, smoking status and employment duration. Exposure-response analyses were performed to identify possible exposure thresholds for lung cancer and silicosis risk.\nRESULTS: Total deaths increased from 1,610 (9.1%) to 4,586 (26%) over 537,129 total person-years at risk. All-cause mortality was elevated among men (SMR\u202f=\u202f1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14); however, a deficit was seen among women (SMR\u202f=\u202f0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98). No statistically significantly increased mortality was seen due to lung cancer, renal cancer, or non-malignant renal disease - conditions reportedly associated with RCS exposure. Lung cancer mortality was unrelated to RCS exposure level. However, for silicosis cases classified using International Labor Organization (ILO) categories \u22651/1 or 1/0, risk was strongly associated with estimated average exposure &gt;0.10\u202fmg/m3 and 0.15\u202fmg/m3, and cumulative exposure &gt;3.0\u202fmg/m3-years and\u202f&gt;\u202f1.0\u202fmg/m3-years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the large number (n\u202f=\u202f284) of lung cancer deaths and high historical RCS exposures, no excess risk and no relationship with exposure level were seen. However, RCS exposure was strongly associated with silicosis risk, with clear exposure thresholds. This study further confirms the lack of increased lung cancer risk at RCS levels historically prevalent in the German porcelain industry and that exposures exceeding estimated thresholds clearly increased silicosis risk. Occupational exposure levels in the German porcelain industry in recent decades have remained well below these thresholds; therefore, few additional silicosis cases are expected."

            "abstract": "Smoking has been identified as a major risk factor for the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a key component of tobacco smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the development of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic strategies."

We leverage survey and electronic health record data from the diverse All of Us Research Program (AoURP) database to investigate whether smoking and smoking-related behaviors increase the risk of lung metastasis in non-lung primary cancers. The results suggest that cigarette use, measured by four continuous variables, does not increase the risk of lung metastasis in seven common cancer types but demonstrates a small significant effect in a cohort including all types of cancer in the database in both univariable and multivariable analyses. An increased odds ratio of electronic smoke use in patients with lung metastasis was seen in multivariable analyses of the all cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04-1.59, P\u2009=\u20090.02) and liver cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.06-2.28, P\u2009=\u20090.02) groups.

This study explored the VTE risk factors and established a machine-learning model to predict a failure of postoperative thromboprophylaxis.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery between January 2018 and November 2022. The patients were randomized 7:3 to the training and test sets. Nine machine learning models were constructed. The three most predictive machine-learning classifiers were chosen as the first layer of the stacking machine-learning model, and logistic regression was the second layer of the meta-learning model.\nRESULTS: This study included 362 patients, including 58 (16.0%) with VTE. Based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis, age, platelets, D-dimers, albumin, smoking history, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 21 mutation were used to develop the nine machine-learning models. LGBM Classifier, RandomForest Classifier, and GNB were chosen for the first layer of the stacking machine learning model. The area under the received operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the stacking machine learning model in the training/test set were 0.984/0.979, 0.949/0.954, 0.935/1.000, and 0.958/0.887, respectively. In the validation set, the final stacking machine learning model demonstrated an ROC AUC of 0.983, accuracy of 0.937, sensitivity of 0.978, and specificity of 0.947.

            "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 susceptibility loci for lung cancer, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain largely unknown, particularly for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Here, we integrated data from 3890 LUSC cases and 13328 controls of Chinese descent, and performed a conditional analysis to explore independent genetic variants and analyzed the interaction between the genetic variants and smoking. Our study was the first to identify a specific association between genetic variants in the 9q33.2 region and increased risk of LUSC in smokers. After adjusting for the tag SNP rs4573350 in 9q33.2, no additional significant genetic variants were found. However, significant additive (RERI=1.66, 95%CI: 1.17-2.22, AP=0.26, 95%CI: 0.19-0.33) and multiple interactions (OR=1.30, 95%CI: 1.08-1.56, P=5.40\u00d710-3) were observed between rs4573350 and smoking. Compared to nonsmokers with the CC genotype, smokers with the CT/TT genotype showed an increased risk of 6.29-fold (95%CI: 5.46-7.23, P=2.00\u00d710-16). Functional annotation identified rs4573350 as the strongest functional variant within the linkage disequilibrium block. Biological experiments confirmed that the combined exposure to the T allele of rs4573350 and cigarette smoke extract promotes the expression of the ZBTB26 by modulating the binding ability of the transcription factor FOXA1. Furthermore, ZBTB26 was found to regulate tumorigenesis of LUSC both in vitro and in vivo by affecting the expression of PCNA, which is involved in cell cycle and promotes tumorigenesis of LUSC."

            "abstract": "Air pollution is an under-recognised global health threat linked to an increased risk of cancers and is due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels. This review provides a high-level overview of the associations between outdoor and indoor air pollution and cancer risk and outcomes. Outdoor air pollutants are largely due to the burning of fossil fuels from human activities, although there is growing data implicating outdoor pollution from wildfire smoke. Indoor air pollution is primarily caused by burning solid fuel sources such as wood, coal and charcoal for household cooking and heating. There is a growing number of pieces of evidence linking exposure to pollution and the risk of developing cancers. The strongest evidence is seen on the positive association of air pollution, particularly particulate matter 2.5 with lung cancer. Emerging data implicate exposure to pollutants in the development of breast, gastrointestinal and other cancers. The mechanisms underlying these associations include oxidative stress, inflammation and direct DNA damage facilitated by pollutant absorption and distribution in the body. References were identified through a PubMed search for articles published in 2000 to October 2024 using the terms 'air pollution' or 'pollutants' and 'carcinoma' or ''cancer'. Air pollution poses significant risks to health. Its health impacts, including cancer risks, are often underestimated. Hazardous pollutants have been studied in several epidemiological cohort studies. Despite the mounting evidence, air pollution is often overlooked in predictive cancer risk models and public health intervention."

This systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the association between WPS and various health conditions.\nMETHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted from inception to January 2025. Eligible observational studies on WPS and health outcomes were selected through a duplicate, independent process. Data extraction, including study details, participant characteristics, methods, and results, was performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), and studies were classified as high, moderate, or poor quality. The GRADE approach was applied to evaluate evidence certainty for each outcome, considering factors such as study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, and publication bias.\nRESULTS: A total of 191 studies with 807,174 participants were included, comprising 98 case-control, 77 cross-sectional, and 16 cohort studies from 24 countries. The median number of studies analyzed per outcome was 5, with a range of 3 to 30. Among the 62 outcomes evaluated, 31 (50%) demonstrated statistically significant effect sizes based on a random-effects model, with stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cancer mortality exhibiting a significant prediction interval. Credibility evaluations identified low-quality evidence for birth weight, CAD, and cardiovascular and cancer mortality, whereas the evidence for the remaining outcomes was graded as very low quality. Significant associations were found between WPS and several health outcomes: gastric cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, CAD, stroke, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, infertility, sperm normal form, sperm DNA fragmentation, chronic bronchitis, cough, sputum, low birth weight (LBW), spirometry parameters, and several dental health indicators.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals strong links between WPS and adverse health outcomes, but low evidence quality calls for rigorous research and public health interventions to mitigate its effects."

The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between physical activity and smoking on the development of MetS and its components. In this repeated cross-sectional study, data from the Iranian STEPwise non-communicable disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS) surveys (2007, 2011, and 2016) were analyzed, which included 40,046 participants aged 25-64 years. Physical activity was categorized as low, moderate, or vigorous based on metabolic equivalents (MET) minutes per week. Smoking status was defined based on self-reported information as either a current smoker or a non-smoker. MetS was diagnosed using established criteria. Interactive association was analyzed using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP), and synergy index (SI), and weighted logistic regression. The weighted prevalence of MetS was higher in the low physical activity group (34.32%) than in the current smokers group (26.63%). Positive interactions between low physical activity and smoking were observed for MetS (RERI\u2009=\u20090.23, AP\u2009=\u20090.25, SI\u2009=\u20090.23), abdominal obesity (RERI\u2009=\u20090.24, AP\u2009=\u20090.31, SI\u2009=\u20090.47) and high triglycerides (RERI\u2009=\u20090.19, AP\u2009=\u20090.19, SI\u2009=\u20090.12). Moderate/vigorous physical activity combined with smoking was associated with lower odds of abdominal obesity, hypertension and elevated fasting blood glucose, but higher odds of low HDL cholesterol. A physical inactivity appears to be a greater potential risk factor for MetS than smoking. The interaction between low physical activity and smoking exacerbates the odds of MetS and several of its components. Promoting physical activity and smoking cessation should be prioritized in MetS prevention and treatment strategies."

Evidence of the genetic links between these phenotypes is emerging, but little is currently known about the genomic regions and biological functions that are involved. To address this, we performed Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA) using large-scale (N\u2009=\u20099,725-933,970) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) results for three IR-related conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome) and nine neuropsychiatric disorders. Subsequently, positional and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based gene mapping and downstream functional genomic analyses were performed on the significant loci. Patterns of negative and positive local genetic correlations (|r<sub>g</sub>|\u2009=\u20090.21-1, p<sub>FDR</sub>\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) were identified at 109 unique genomic regions across all phenotype pairs. Local correlations emerged even in the absence of global genetic correlations between IR-related conditions and Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Genes mapped to the correlated regions showed enrichment in biological pathways integral to immune-inflammatory function, vesicle trafficking, insulin signalling, oxygen transport, and lipid metabolism. Colocalisation analyses further prioritised 10 genetically correlated regions for likely harbouring shared causal variants, displaying high deleterious or regulatory potential. These variants were found within or in close proximity to genes, such as SLC39A8 and HLA-DRB1, that can be targeted by supplements and already known drugs, including omega-3/6 fatty acids, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Overall, our findings highlight the complex genetic architecture of IR-neuropsychiatric multimorbidity, advocating for an integrated disease model and offering novel insights for research and treatment strategies in this domain."

We aim to review the available evidence on the metabolic effects of tirzepatide, focusing on weight loss and maintenance of lost weight, body composition alterations, appetite regulation, glycemic control, and lipid profile modulation. Tirzepatide administration for 72 weeks elicited significant weight reduction ranging from 5\u202f% to 20.9\u202f% across different trials in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, limited evidence showed that lost body weight may be primarily due to fat mass reduction. Tirzepatide also significantly decreased food intake, reduced overall appetite scores and increased fasting visual analog scale scores for satiety and fullness across different clinical trials. Moreover, tirzepatide exhibited favorable effects on glycemic control, with notable reductions in HbA1c levels ranging from 20.4\u202fmmol/mol with the 5\u202fmg dose to 28.2\u202fmmol/mol with the 15\u202fmg dose, following treatment durations lasting 40-52 weeks. Additionally, tirzepatide exerts a beneficial impact on lipid profile parameters, including reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Despite its efficacy, tirzepatide is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects, which requires dose escalation strategies to enhance tolerability. Mild to moderate adverse events are commonly reported at higher doses, with discontinuation rates ranging from 4\u202f% to 10\u202f% across different dosages. In conclusion, tirzepatide has shown multifaceted metabolic effects, along with manageable adverse profiles, which makes it a promising therapeutic agent for addressing both obesity and T2DM. However, further long-term randomized controlled trials are warranted to reveal long-term efficacy and safety outcomes, particularly in diverse patient populations."

Lignans, a class of plant natural compounds found in commonly consumed foods, are well-tolerated by humans and have demonstrated promising potential in the management of DM. Consumption of lignan-rich foods has been associated with improved overall health and quality of life.\nPURPOSE: The clinical and preclinical evidence on the role of lignans in managing DM are critically examined.\nMETHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted across major scientific databases, focusing on studies that reported the effects of individual lignans on key diabetes indicators, such as glucose utilisation and insulin sensitivity, in both human and animal models, as well as in cell-based studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 lignans were included in the review. Out of these, only three were investigated in randomised clinical trials in humans and 31 in animal models. The reviewed evidence suggests some beneficial effects of lignans in preventing the development of obesity-related diabetes. Their therapeutic benefits in preventing diabetes-related complications, particularly diabetic nephropathy, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, are also supported. Metabolites of various lignans, produced by microbial metabolism in the gut and serum enzymes, appear to be key bioactive forms, highlighting the need for detailed pharmacodynamic studies, optimised dosage designs, and the use of the appropriate lignan molecules for cell-based screening.\nCONCLUSION: Lignans and their microbial metabolites show promise in preventing obesity-related diabetes and mitigating diabetes-related complications such as diabetic nephropathy, though further clinical studies are needed to optimize their therapeutic potential."

Management of BED centers around psychological and pharmacological treatment modalities, which have been associated with variable efficacy and the potential for severe adverse effects. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), approved by the Food and Drug Administration for conditions such as diabetes and weight management, are an emerging therapy of interest in BED.\nSUMMARY: In this case report, we describe use of dulaglutide for treatment of a patient with BED, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's baseline binge eating scale (BES) score, glycated hemoglobin level, body mass index (BMI), and weight were obtained. Following these baseline assessments, dulaglutide 0.75\u00a0mg once weekly was initiated to optimize management of the patient's type 2 diabetes. Follow-up measurements were obtained 6 weeks after initiation, at which time reductions in the patient's BES score, BMI, weight, and BED symptoms were observed. Moreover, dulaglutide was well tolerated without adverse drug events.\nCONCLUSION: This case report describes the use of dulaglutide in the management of mild BED in the setting of comorbid type 2 diabetes and obesity. Further research is necessary to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs in the management of BED and to determine the optimal duration and dose."

Traditional treatments often show limited long-term success, while bariatric surgery has emerged as the most effective intervention for sustained weight loss and comorbidity improvement. Alterations in gut microbiota may significantly contribute to these metabolic improvements.\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review was\u00a0aimed at evaluating changes in gut microbiota composition before and after bariatric surgery and their association with clinical outcomes, including weight loss, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism.\nMETHODS: Following\u00a0the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\u00a0Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)\u00a0guidelines, a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov databases was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Keywords included \"bariatric surgery,\" \"gut microbiota\" and \"obesity.\" Inclusion criteria focused on human studies with pre and post-surgical microbiota analysis. Non-human studies, pediatric populations and studies without microbiota assessment were excluded. Data extraction covered microbiota profiles, metabolic outcomes and clinical markers.\nRESULTS: Total 27 articles and 28 clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Pre-surgery, obese patients exhibited dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity and imbalances in key bacterial phyla. Post-surgery, especially after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), patients showed increased microbial diversity, reduced Firmicutes and elevated beneficial bacteria such as\u00a0Akkermansia muciniphila and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria. These microbiota changes were correlated with significant improvements in weight loss, insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. However, some studies reported inconsistent or modest microbiota changes.\nCONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery leads to significant gut microbiota alterations that are closely linked to metabolic improvements, including enhanced glucose control and lipid metabolism. However, the long-term sustainability of these microbial changes remains unclear. Longitudinal studies are essential to determine whether these alterations persist over time and how they continuously impact metabolic health. Further research should explore targeted microbiota interventions to maintain beneficial microbial profiles post-surgery."

While lifestyle and dietary modifications remain the cornerstone of MASLD management, the optimal dietary approach remains uncertain. Objectives: This systematic review aims to investigate the impact of model dietary patterns on metabolic outcomes in patients with MASLD and evaluate their effects in individuals with coexisting metabolic conditions, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: To conduct the review, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on the adult population, published between January 2019 and September 2024, following PRISMA principles. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed qualitatively based on study characteristics. Results: The main findings of this review demonstrated that the use of interventions with dietary model based on Mediterranean diet (MED) and intermittent fasting (IF) approaches, such as alternative-day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding regimens (TRF) may have potential in reducing body weight, BMI, and waist circumference, with additional benefits of improving glycemic control and reducing inflammation. The effects on hepatic functions, although limited, may be linked with reduced enzyme activity and liver stiffness. Additionally, the use of lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (LOV-D) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may offer additional health benefits, including blood pressure management. Conclusions: This review suggests that MED and IF-based strategies may reduce BW, improve glycemic control, and lower inflammation, with potential benefits for hepatic function. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm these effects and underlying mechanisms, which will allow for the optimization of protocols and ensure their safety in MASLD."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. It poses a significant global health challenge. AD is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain, along with chronic inflammation, dysfunctional neurons, and synapse loss. While the prevalence of AD continues to rise, the current FDA-approved drugs offer only limited effectiveness. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are also implicated in AD pathogenesis, with epidemiological studies and animal models confirming the impact of IR on A\u03b2 accumulation, and high-fat diets also exacerbating A\u03b2 accumulation. Since neuroinflammation activated by A\u03b2 involves the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of the activated B cell (NF-\u03baB) pathway, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are potential therapeutic strategies in AD. Bioactive compounds, including polyphenols (resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, and quercetin), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, show promising results in animal studies and clinical trials for reducing A\u03b2 levels, improving cognition and modulating the signaling pathways implicated in AD. This review explores the interplay between obesity, IR, inflammation, and AD pathology, emphasizing the potential of dietary compounds and their role in reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and cognitive decline, as viable strategies for AD prevention and treatment. By integrating epidemiological findings, observational studies, and clinical trials, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understating of how metabolic dysfunctions and bioactive compounds influence AD progression."

The prevalence of MASLD, MASL, and MASH increased from 2012 to 2019 in all the populations studied. The highest risk of hospitalization was associated with liver-related causes, followed by all-cause hospitalization. The highest cost per subject in 2019 was observed in individuals with concomitant MASH and T2DM. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a rising prevalence of MASLD, MASL, and MASH, despite their potential underdiagnosis during the study period. The presence of MASLD or MASH was associated with high healthcare costs, particularly in patients with MASH and T2DM. Our results underline the need for more effective strategies to enhance disease awareness and improve resource allocation."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by disturbances\u2002in glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism, including dyslipidemia and dysregulation of metabolic peptides like spexin; however, the effects of combined interventions, such as aerobic training and nutritional intervention, on these parameters are not fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of aerobic training (AT) and vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation on the lipid profile and spexin levels in a model of rats with type 2 diabetes\u2002(T2D).\nMETHODS: A total of 56 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: SHAM (non-diabetic control; n\u2009=\u20098) and diabetic (n\u2009=\u200948). The diabetic rats were further divided into six groups: AT with high doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), AT with moderate doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), high doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), moderate doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), AT receiving vehicle (sesame oil; D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009oil), and control (oil-receiving; D\u2009+\u2009C). To induce type 2 diabetes, rats were first fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks to induce obesity, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 110\u00a0mg/kg nicotinamide and 55\u00a0mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in 0.1\u00a0M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Blood samples were collected 48\u00a0h after the last training session under anesthesia for measuring spexin levels, and lipid profile parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey post hoc test.\nRESULTS: Compared to the SHAM rats, there were significant increases in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC in the diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Also, there was a significant decrease in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC of the\u2002diabetic groups who received interventions, especially in D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD (body weight: -11.07%, BMI: -10.25%, FI: -19.16%, WC: -16.54%). The lipid profiles were significantly improved, with the lowest total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and the highest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels being found in the D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD\u2002group compared with the D\u2009+\u2009C group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD group had elevated spexin levels compared with the other diabetic groups, which may play a metabolic\u2002role.\nCONCLUSION: AT and Vit D supplementation effectively normalized serum lipids and increased spexin levels in T2D rats. These findings suggest that AT and Vit D supplementation may serve as potential therapeutic strategies for managing T2D and its associated complications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the long-term effects of these interventions in humans."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic disease is increasingly impacting women of reproductive age. In pregnancy, uncontrolled metabolic disease can result in offspring with major congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and abnormal fetal growth. Pregnancy also accelerates the complications of metabolic diseases in mothers resulting in an increased risk of premature cardiovascular events. Despite the convincing evidence that preconception care can largely mitigate the risks of metabolic disease in pregnancy, there are few data about how to identify the highest-risk women so that they can be connected with appropriate preconception care services.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to determine the maternal phenotype that represents the highest risk of having adverse neonatal and maternal pregnancy outcomes.\nMETHODS: This will be a prospective cohort study of 500 women recruited in early pregnancy. The primary outcome is a composite of offspring born small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) (customized birthweight \u226410th and \u226590th centile for gestational age). Secondary outcomes are (1) composite of adverse neonatal birth outcomes (SGA, LGA, major congenital abnormalities, preterm birth [<37 weeks' gestation]) and (2) composite of new maternal metabolic outcomes (gestational diabetes, diabetes in pregnancy, type 2 diabetes [T2D] or prediabetes; gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia or new essential hypertension after pregnancy; and gestational weight gain \u226520kg or new overweight/obesity at the 12-18 months postpartum visit). A multivariable logistic regression analysis will be conducted to identify candidate predictors of poor pregnancy outcomes due to metabolic disease. From this model, model coefficients and the associated 95% CIs will be extracted to derive the risk score for predicting the delivery of LGA/SGA offspring (primary outcome) and composites of adverse neonatal outcomes and maternal outcomes (secondary outcomes).\nRESULTS: Seed funding for the project was acquired in November 2022 and subsequent funding was acquired in May 2024. The first participant was recruited on March 23, 2023. At the time of manuscript submission, 402 participants have been recruited. Data analysis has not yet been performed. Results are expected to be published in the first half of 2027.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is a prospective observational cohort study that intends to identify the metabolic disease risk factors, or combination of factors, that are most likely to cause adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes. These characteristics will be used to develop a risk calculator which will assist in identifying the highest risk women and in triaging them to appropriate services.

Outcomes included glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose [FPG], 2-hour postprandial glucose [2hPG]), inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, CRP), cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids), gut microbiota, and safety.\nRESULTS: The intervention group showed greater reductions in HbA1c (-\u20091.06% vs. -0.35%, P\u2009=\u20090.028), FPG (-\u20094.16 vs. -3.92 mmol/L, P\u2009=\u20090.010), and inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1: -43.6% vs. -33.3%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Pancreatic beta-cell function improved significantly (HOMA-\u03b2: +34.7% vs. +23.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.034), with increased beneficial gut microbiota (Lactobacillus: +2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2076 vs. +1.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2076 CFU/g, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Both regimens were well-tolerated, with no severe hypoglycemia or renal/hepatic toxicity.\nCONCLUSION: Combining dulaglutide with probiotics enhances glycemic control, reduces inflammation, and improves cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM more effectively than dulaglutide alone, likely through gut microbiota modulation. This dual approach offers a promising strategy for T2DM management, though larger long-term trials are needed to confirm cardiovascular benefits."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, whether outcomes in subtypes of individuals at risk for T2D and/or comorbidities (T\u00fcbingen Clusters) differ, is unknown. Of these, cluster 5 (C5) and cluster 6 (C6) are high-risk clusters for developing T2D and/or comorbidities, while cluster 4 (C4) is a low-risk cluster. We investigated bariatric surgery outcomes, hypothesizing that high-risk clusters benefit most due to great potential for metabolic improvement.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We allocated participants without T2D but at risk for T2D, defined by elevated BMI, to the T\u00fcbingen Clusters. Participants had normal glucose regulation or prediabetes according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Two cohorts underwent bariatric surgery: a discovery (Lille, France) and a replication cohort (Rome, Italy). A control cohort (T\u00fcbingen, Germany) received behavioral modification counseling. Main outcomes included alteration of glucose regulation parameters and prediabetes remission.\nRESULTS: In the discovery cohort, 15.0% of participants (n = 121) were allocated to C4, 22.3% (n = 180) to C5, and 62.4% (n = 503) to C6. Relative body weight loss was similar among all clusters; however, reduction of insulin resistance and improvement of \u03b2-cell function were strongest in C5. Prediabetes remission rate was lowest in low-risk C4 and highest in high-risk C5. Individuals from high-risk clusters changed to low-risk clusters in both bariatric surgery cohorts but not in the control cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants in C5 had the highest benefit from bariatric surgery in terms of improvement in insulin resistance, \u03b2-cell function, and prediabetes remission. This novel classification might help identify individuals who will benefit specifically from bariatric surgery."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study systematically explores the overall impact and interactions of body composition and nutritional inflammatory indices on early-onset mild cognitive impairment (EOMCI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study included 816 T2DM patients. Body composition indices included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), visceral fat area (VFA), body fat percentage (BF%), and skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI). Nutritional inflammatory indices included the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index (CALLY), and fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR). K-means clustering and quantile g-computation (QGC) assessed the combined impact, with interactions evaluated by simple slope analysis.\nRESULTS: K-means clustering revealed two distinct patterns: Low-pattern and High-pattern. The Low-pattern group exhibited significantly lower body composition indices (BMI 24.6 vs. 27.7 kg/m2; WC 88 vs. 99 cm; ABSI 0.081 vs. 0.084; BRI 3.89 vs. 5.02; VFA 91 vs. 112; BF% 29% vs. 31%; SMMI 9.38 vs. 10.48 kg/m2; all P &lt; 0.001) and poorer nutritional status with higher inflammation (GNRI 97.9 vs. 104.6; PNI 47.9 vs. 53.1; CALLY index 4 vs. 5; FAR 0.082 vs. 0.072; all P &lt; 0.05). This group had a higher prevalence of EOMCI (32% vs. 23%, P = 0.006). After adjusting for confounders, the Low-pattern group had a 1.45-fold increased risk of EOMCI (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01-2.08). QGC analysis demonstrated that the combined overall effect of body composition and nutritional inflammatory indices was negatively associated with EOMCI risk. A one-quintile increase in all indices was linked to a significant 31.3% reduction in EOMCI risk (95% CI -44.4%, -15.0%). Interaction analysis revealed that abdominal obesity (ABSI &gt; 0.08), combined with malnutrition (low GNRI), significantly increased EOMCI risk (P <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.018). Similarly, low muscle mass (SMMI &lt; 11.33 kg/m2), when combined with malnutrition and high inflammation (low CALLY index), further exacerbated EOMCI risk (P <sub>interaction</sub>  = 0.028).\nDISCUSSION: The findings suggest that in T2DM patients, the interactions and overall effects of underweight, reduced muscle mass, abdominal obesity, malnutrition, and elevated inflammation are significantly associated with an increased risk of EOMCI. Integrated management of these factors is essential to mitigate EOMCI risk."

Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes impairs lipid catabolism, and obesity raises the risk of isolated systolic hypertension. However, in Ethiopia minimal study has been conducted to address the specific relationship between isolated systolic hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to determine the magnitude and determinants of isolated systolic hypertension among type 2 diabetes patients in selected referral hospitals of Amhara region, Ethiopia. A multicenter institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 and December 30, 2023. Referral hospitals were chosen using simple random sampling. Additionally, participants in the study were chosen from the designated referral hospitals using systematic sampling approaches. To collect clinical and sociodemographic data, an interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized. Epi-data version-4.6 and Stata-14 were used for data entry and statistical analysis, respectively. The descriptive statistics were presented with tables and graphs. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify associated factors of isolated systolic hypertension. In the final model, statistical significance was decided at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05, and the strength of association was indicated using an adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI. The analysis included 258 participants, and the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension was found to be 21.3% (95% CI 18-27.1%). Older age (AOR\u2009=\u20094.64, 95%CI 1.31,16.36), fasting blood sugar of \u2265\u2009130\u00a0mg/dl (AOR\u2009=\u20092.32, 95% CI; 1.04, 5.19), and BMI\u2009&gt;\u200925 Kg/m2 (AOR\u2009=\u20092.75, 95% CI (1.33, 5.68)) were statistically significant factors of isolated systolic hypertension. The prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in this study was high, affecting large population of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Older age, high body mass index (BMI), and elevated fasting blood sugar levels were identified as key determinants of ISH. The study emphasizes the need for regular monitoring and management of blood pressure in T2DM patients, particularly those who are older, and have higher BMI."

            "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight infants are at increased risk not only of mortality, but also of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD in later life. At the opposite end of the spectrum, high birthweight infants have increased risk of birth complications, such as shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia and obesity, and similarly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of birthweight in the UK Biobank have primarily focused on individuals within the 'normal' range and have excluded individuals with high and low birthweight (<2.5 kg or >4.5 kg). The aim of this study was to investigate genetic variation associated within the tail ends of the birthweight distribution, to: (1) see whether the genetic factors operating in these regions were different from those that explained variation in birthweight within the normal range; (2) explore the genetic correlation between extremes of birthweight and cardiometabolic disease; and (3) investigate whether analysing the full distribution of birthweight values, including the extremes, improved the ability to detect genuine loci in GWAS.\nMETHODS: We performed case-control GWAS analysis of low (&lt;2.5 kg) and high (&gt;4.5 kg) birthweight in the UK Biobank using REGENIE software (N<sub>low</sub>=20,947; N<sub>high</sub>=12,715; N<sub>controls</sub>=207,506) and conducted three continuous GWAS of birthweight, one including the full range of birthweights, one involving a truncated GWAS including only individuals with birthweights between 2.5 and 4.5 kg and a third GWAS that winsorised birthweight values &lt;2.5 kg and &gt;4.5 kg. Additionally, we performed bivariate linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between low/normal/high birthweight and cardiometabolic traits.\nRESULTS: Bivariate LD score regression analyses suggested that high birthweight had a mostly similar genetic aetiology to birthweight within the normal range (genetic correlation coefficient [r<sub>G</sub>]=0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 0.99), whereas there was more evidence for a separate set of genes underlying low birthweight (r<sub>G</sub>=-0.74, 95% CI 0.66, 0.82). Low birthweight was also significantly positively genetically correlated with most cardiometabolic traits and diseases we examined, whereas high birthweight was mostly positively genetically correlated with adiposity and anthropometric-related traits. The winsorisation strategy performed best in terms of locus detection, with the number of independent genome-wide significant associations (p&lt;5\u00d710-8) increasing from 120 genetic variants at 94 loci in the truncated GWAS to 270 genetic variants at 178 loci, including 27 variants at 25 loci that had not been identified in previous birthweight GWAS. This included a novel low-frequency missense variant in the ABCC8 gene, a gene known to be involved in congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes mellitus and MODY, that was estimated to be responsible for a 170 g increase in birthweight amongst carriers.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results underscore the importance of genetic factors in the genesis of the phenotypic correlation between birthweight and cardiometabolic traits and diseases."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review addresses critical gaps in knowledge and provides a literature overview of the molecular pathways connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to increased intestinal permeability (commonly referred to as \"leaky gut\") and its contribution to metabolic disorders. Restoring a healthy gut microbiota holds significant potential for enhancing intestinal barrier function and metabolic health. These interventions offer promising therapeutic avenues for addressing leaky gut and its associated pathologies in metabolic syndrome.\nRECENT FINDINGS: In metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), beneficial microbes such as those producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other key metabolites like taurine, spermidine, glutamine, and indole derivatives are reduced. Concurrently, microbes that degrade toxic metabolites such as ethanolamine also decline, while proinflammatory, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-enriched microbes increase. These microbial shifts place a higher burden on intestinal epithelial cells, which are in closest proximity to the gut lumen, inducing detrimental changes that compromise the structural and functional integrity of the intestinal barrier. Such changes include exacerbation of tight junction protein (TJP)s dysfunction, particularly through mechanisms such as destabilization of zona occludens (Zo)-1 mRNA or post-translational modifications. Emerging therapeutic strategies including ketogenic and Mediterranean diets, as well as probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics have demonstrated efficacy in restoring beneficial microbial populations, enhancing TJP expression and function, supporting gut barrier integrity, reducing leaky gut and inflammation, and ultimately improving metabolic disorders. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which gut microbiota contribute to the development of leaky gut and inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome. It also explores strategies for restoring gut microbiota balance and functionality by promoting beneficial microbes, increasing the production of beneficial metabolites, clearing toxic metabolites, and reducing the proportion of proinflammatory microbes. These approaches can alleviate the burden on intestinal epithelial cells, reduce leaky gut and inflammation, and improve metabolic health."

Using data from May 1 to May 31, 2020, the current study compares three states: Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. A compartmental model has been developed in order to forecast the pandemic's trajectory and devise an effective control strategy. The study then examines the dynamic progression of the pandemic by including important epidemiological factors into a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. Our method is a thorough analysis of the equilibria of the deterministic mathematical model in question. We use rigorous techniques to find these equilibrium points and then conduct a comprehensive investigation of their stability. Furthermore, an optimum control problem is applied to reduce the illness fatality, taking into account both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical intervention options as control functions. With the aid of Pontryagin's maximal principle, an objective functional has been created and solved in order to minimize the number of infected people and lower the cost of the controls. In terms of the basic reproduction number, the stability of biologically plausible equilibrium points and the qualitative behavior of the model are examined. We found that the disease transmission rate has an effect on reducing the spread of diseases after conducting sensitivity analysis with regard to the basic reproduction number. According to the findings, Tamil Nadu had the lowest reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) and Maharashtra the highest ([Formula: see text]), indicating regional differences in the efficacy of public health initiatives. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that appropriate control strategies, such as vaccination (\u039c), can successfully reduce infection levels and improve recovery rates. In our study compared to the other two states, Tamil Nadu is notable for its quick recovery and decrease in infection rates. In our findings are more dependable and applicable when mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are combined, which also helps to provide a more thorough understanding of the dynamics at work in the COVID-19 environment. This research also offers suggestions for how government agencies, health groups, and legislators can lessen the effects of COVID-19 and distribute resources as efficiently as possible . Finally, we conclude by discussing the optimal control strategy to contain the epidemic."

            "title": "Adult Vaccine Coadministration Is Safe, Effective, and Acceptable: Results of a Survey of the Literature.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coadministration of vaccines in children is a long-standing practice that has proven to be safe and effective in improving the efficiency of vaccine administration, thereby increasing immunization coverage rates. As the number of vaccines routinely recommended for adults increases, and with limited opportunities for adults to have preventive health touchpoints with providers, adult vaccine coadministration should be considered as a routine practice to improve vaccination coverage rates and public health. A review of existing literature was conducted to examine the potential reactogenicity and impact on effectiveness when co-administering vaccines to adults.\nMETHODS: Medline was searched for research articles with the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination,\" combined with the search terms \"simultaneous,\" \"concomitant,\" \"concurrent,\" and \"combination.\" Another search of Medline was conducted on the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination\" combined with the following individual search terms: \"RSV,\" \"COVID,\" and \"Tdap.\" The references of extracted articles were also examined for potential other relevant articles.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Adult vaccine coadministration is safe for all the combinations we assessed. Most adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate and of short duration. Some studies showed slightly more reactogenicity with coadministration but few or no serious AEs or safety signals. Nearly every study confirmed that coadministration had no significant effect on immune response for either vaccine. The benefits of vaccine coadministration outweigh the risks. It increases convenience for vaccinees, reduces the number of missed opportunities to vaccinate, and contributes to efficient use of healthcare resources."

            "title": "A promising mRNA vaccine derived from the JN.1 spike protein confers protective immunity against multiple emerged Omicron variants.",
            "abstract": "Despite the declared end of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, with emerging JN.1-derived subvariants (e.g., KP.2, KP.3) compromising the efficacy of current XBB.1.5-based vaccines. To address this, we developed an mRNA vaccine encoding the full-length spike protein of JN.1, incorporating GSAS and 2P mutations and encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The JN.1-mRNA vaccine elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, including high JN.1-specific IgG titers, cross-neutralizing antibodies, and increased T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, and T cell cytokines. Importantly, immunity persisted for up to six months and induced RBD-specific long-lived plasma cells. We also compared the immune responses induced by homologous and heterologous vaccination regimens, and our results demonstrated that the heterologous regimen-combining JN.1-mRNA with a recombinant protein vaccine (RBD<sub>JN.1</sub>-HR)-induced stronger responses. These findings highlight the JN.1-mRNA vaccine constitutes an effective prophylactic approach against JN.1-related variants, as it induces potent neutralizing antibody responses across all tested lineages. This enhanced immunogenicity is expected to significantly reduce hospitalization rates and mitigate post-COVID complications associated with JN.1 and KP.3 infections. This study emphasizes the need for timely vaccine updates and the adaptability of mRNA vaccines in addressing emerging pathogens, providing a framework for combating future infectious diseases. Collectively, these results offer critical insights for vaccine design and public health strategies in response to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airborne pathogens present challenges in settings like jails or prisons with a high density of contacts. The state of Georgia has the highest percentage of its citizens under correctional supervision in the United States. Yet, it had slow COVID vaccine uptake among jail residents, requiring prevention also using non-pharmaceutical interventions. Using a network-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model parameterized with data from the Fulton County Jail, this study investigates the impact of three SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies: vaccination, contact tracing and quarantining, and jail release to reduce jail population density.\nMETHODS: Social contact networks were simulated at two different overlapping network layers: cell and block. Cell-level contacts represented shared confined sleeping space, whereas block-level contacts represented shared socialization space. Contact tracing and quarantining were simulated at the cell-level or both cell- and block-levels, hereafter referred to as all-level. A reference scenario and nine intervention scenarios were simulated three hundred times to estimate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the outcome measures. Each scenario simulated a 185-day period to measure the prolonged effects of the interventions amid a potential COVID outbreak in the jail. The cumulative incidence, number of infections averted (NIA), and percentage of infections averted (PIA) were calculated comparing interventions against a base scenario without them. For the seven scenarios involving contact tracing and quarantining, total quarantines over the simulation and the number of quarantines per day were calculated to determine the quarantine requirements. Sensitivity analyses compared the impact of jointly varying vaccination rates and contact tracing rates.\nRESULTS: Cell-level contact tracing alone was an ineffective intervention (3.2% PIA), but its impact increased in combination with other interventions (i.e., vaccination or increased jail release rate). The other intervention strategies each produced a PIA over 10%, with the jail release scenario producing a PIA of nearly 20% despite only resulting in a 13% reduction in the jail population. The all-level contact tracing only scenario was effective at both 50% and 100% of contacts traced, but feasibility would be limited without a reduction in the jail population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementing a combination intervention approach could substantially reduce the morbidity from COVID-19 and future respiratory viruses in this jail setting while providing secondary protection to the community."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Since its emergence in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic, presenting significant challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. Extensive research has focused on diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine development to combat the virus. Given the need for effective strategies to reduce infection rates, disease progression, and severity, this study aimed to investigate the potential role of vitamin D (25OHD) in mitigating the severity of COVID-19.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D levels were measured using the Roche Diagnostics Vitamin D assay in 100 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, and the correlation between vitamin D levels and symptom severity was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The findings demonstrated that a significant proportion of symptomatic patients had vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL. In contrast, approximately 25% of asymptomatic patients had vitamin D levels exceeding 30 ng/mL. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant association between low vitamin D levels and increased symptom severity (p=0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation could potentially reduce the risk of severe disease. However, to confirm these findings and support these recommendations, further research, including randomized controlled trials and large-scale population studies, is necessary."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decades of steady improvements in life expectancy in Europe slowed down from around 2011, well before the COVID-19 pandemic, for reasons which remain disputed. We aimed to assess how changes in risk factors and cause-specific death rates in different European countries related to changes in life expectancy in those countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: We used data and methods from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021 to compare changes in life expectancy at birth, causes of death, and population exposure to risk factors in 16 European Economic Area countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden) and the four UK nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) for three time periods: 1990-2011, 2011-19, and 2019-21. Changes in life expectancy and causes of death were estimated with an established life expectancy cause-specific decomposition method, and compared with summary exposure values of risk factors for the major causes of death influencing life expectancy.\nFINDINGS: All countries showed mean annual improvements in life expectancy in both 1990-2011 (overall mean 0\u00b723 years [95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0\u00b723 to 0\u00b724]) and 2011-19 (overall mean 0\u00b715 years [0\u00b713 to 0\u00b716]). The rate of improvement was lower in 2011-19 than in 1990-2011 in all countries except for Norway, where the mean annual increase in life expectancy rose from 0\u00b721 years (95% UI 0\u00b720 to 0\u00b722) in 1990-2011 to 0\u00b723 years (0\u00b721 to 0\u00b726) in 2011-19 (difference of 0\u00b703 years). In other countries, the difference in mean annual improvement between these periods ranged from -0\u00b701 years in Iceland (0\u00b719 years [95% UI 0\u00b716 to 0\u00b721] vs 0\u00b718 years [0\u00b709 to 0\u00b726]), to -0\u00b718 years in England (0\u00b725 years [0\u00b724 to 0\u00b725] vs 0\u00b707 years [0\u00b706 to 0\u00b708]). In 2019-21, there was an overall decrease in mean annual life expectancy across all countries (overall mean -0\u00b718 years [95% UI -0\u00b722 to -0\u00b713]), with all countries having an absolute fall in life expectancy except for Ireland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, which showed marginal improvement in life expectancy, and Belgium, which showed no change in life expectancy. Across countries, the causes of death responsible for the largest improvements in life expectancy from 1990 to 2011 were cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms. Deaths from cardiovascular diseases were the primary driver of reductions in life expectancy improvements during 2011-19, and deaths from respiratory infections and other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes were responsible for the decreases in life expectancy during 2019-21. Deaths from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms in 2019 were attributable to high systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, tobacco smoke, high LDL cholesterol, high BMI, occupational risks, high alcohol use, and other risks including low physical activity. Exposure to these major risk factors differed by country, with trends of increasing exposure to high BMI and decreasing exposure to tobacco smoke observed in all countries during 1990-2021.\nINTERPRETATION: The countries that best maintained improvements in life expectancy after 2011 (Norway, Iceland, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden) did so through better maintenance of reductions in mortality from cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, underpinned by decreased exposures to major risks, possibly mitigated by government policies. The continued improvements in life expectancy in five countries during 2019-21 indicate that these countries were better prepared to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast, countries with the greatest slowdown in life expectancy improvements after 2011 went on to have some of the largest decreases in life expectancy in 2019-21. These findings suggest that government policies that improve population health also build resilience to future shocks. Such policies include reducing population exposure to major upstream risks for cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, such as harmful diets and low physical activity, tackling the commercial determinants of poor health, and ensuring access to affordable health services.\nFUNDING: Gates Foundation."

This investigation assessed the intention and determinant factors of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers in Japan in the 2024-2025 pre-season.\nMETHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted utilizing data collected from hospital staff at Okayama University Hospital, Japan, to inform the COVID-19 vaccination strategy in October 2024. The analysis evaluated demographic characteristics, vaccine intention, perceived barriers to vaccination, and maximum acceptable out-of-pocket expenditure.\nRESULTS: The study population of 3417 respondents comprised 843 medical doctors (24.7\u00a0%), 1131 nurses (33.1\u00a0%), 320 other medical staff (9.4\u00a0%), 286 dental doctors (8.4\u00a0%), and 627 administrative officers (18.3\u00a0%). At full cost, 2109 (61.7\u00a0%) indicated no intention to receive vaccination, while only 4.4\u00a0% expressed willingness to be vaccinated and 33.9\u00a0% remained undecided. With total self-payment, the vaccination acceptance rates were the highest and lowest among medical doctors (11.4\u00a0%) and nurses (1.0\u00a0%), respectively. Cost (38.1\u00a0%), followed by safety issues (29.5\u00a0%) and concerns regarding efficacy or medical necessity (20.3\u00a0%), emerged as the primary barrier. The projected vaccination intention increased to 43.9\u00a0% and 54.9\u00a0% at reduced self-pay costs of 3000 JPY and 5000 JPY, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Addressing financial constraints through policy interventions could be effective strategies in increasing overall vaccination coverage among healthcare workers. In addition, providing tailored education on vaccine safety, efficacy, and necessity may further facilitate increased vaccine uptake within this critical population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rwandan individuals bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are at-risk of Ebola virus disease. A 2019 to 2021 vaccination campaign called UMURINZI offered a Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. 2-dose heterologous Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo) to Rwandan individuals aged \u22652 years and not pregnant. In this region with high rates of pregnancy, preventing pregnancy until their second dose of the Ebola vaccine is essential to ensure full protection. This analysis describes contraceptive use, pregnancy incidence, serious adverse events (SAE), and the effect of pregnancy and SAE on receipt of the second dose among women in the UMURINZI vaccination campaign.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: During the vaccination campaign, women who were fertile and sexually active were counseled as part of the campaign by trained UMURINZI nursing staff about preventing pregnancy until dose two (56 days post-dose one) and offered contraception. Women were followed up to their second dose appointment. Contraception, pregnancy incidence, and SAE were recorded. Of the 47,585 fertile and sexually active women, the mean age was 28\u00b70 years (standard deviation 9\u00b79 years), 54\u00b77% (n = 26,051) were from Rubavu and 45\u00b73% (n = 21,534) were from Rusizi, and 71\u00b79% (n = 34,158) had not crossed the DRC border in the last year. Sixty-six percent (66\u00b76%, n = 31,675) were not using modern contraception at baseline and 19\u00b71% (n = 9,082) were using hormonal implants, 10\u00b79% (n = 5,204) injectables, 2\u00b79% (n = 1,393) oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), and 0\u00b75% (n = 231) intrauterine devices. After contraceptive counseling, 8\u00b70% (n = 2,549) of non-users initiated a method of contraception and 3\u00b76% (n = 50) of OCP users switched to a more effective method. Of the 969 incident pregnancies detected after dose one, 18\u00b78% (n = 182) resulted in an obstetric SAE, primarily due to spontaneous abortion which occurred in 16\u00b70% (n = 155) of all incident pregnancies. Other obstetric SAE included 14 blighted ova, 9 stillbirths, 1 termination due to hydrops fetalis, 1 cleft palate, and 2 threatened abortions resulting in normal deliveries. Six pregnant women had a non-obstetric SAE (0\u00b76%), including 1 postpartum death from COVID-19 and 5 hospitalizations. Among the 74,002 women without an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 0\u00b701% (n = 4) had an SAE; 2 were fatalities due to hypertension and diabetes in one case and seizures in the other, and the other 2 were hospitalizations. No SAE were determined to be related to the vaccine by the program physicians. Among the 74,002 women without an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 94\u00b76% (n = 69,986) received dose two; in contrast, among the 969 women with an incident pregnancy detected after dose one, 34\u00b75% (n = 334) received dose two after pregnancy completion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many fertile and sexually active women who sought vaccination during UMURINZI were not using contraception prior to vaccination, and contraceptive method uptake after family planning counseling and method provision was low. Most women who became pregnant after the first vaccination dose did not receive the second dose, thus potentially reducing protection against Ebola. Family planning messaging for this context should be developed and pilot-tested. The estimated risk of spontaneous abortion was similar to previous estimates from Rwanda and other African countries."

This review investigates the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B among patients with COVID-19.\nMETHODS: This meta- analysis included 38 primary studies investigating co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza in confirmed cases of COVID-19. The global online databases were used to identify relevant studies published between December 2019 and July 2024. Data analysis was performed using STATA Ver. 17 software, and standard errors of prevalence were calculated using the binomial distribution formula. Heterogeneity of study results was evaluated using the I-square and Q index, and publication bias was examined using the Begg's and Egger's tests, as well as funnel plot. A random effects model was used to determine prevalence rates, and a forest plot diagram was used to present results with 95% confidence intervals. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to check the impact of each primary study on the overall estimate.\nRESULT: The analysis found that the prevalence of influenza in co-infected patients at 95% confidence interval using a random effect model was 14% (95% CI: 8-20%). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the random-effects model for influenza A, 11% (95% CI: 5-18%) and B, 4% (95% CI: 2-7%) in co-infected patients. The highest prevalence of influenza A/B (21%), influenza A (17%) and influenza B (20%) was shown in Asia and Europe respectively. Subgroup analysis by study year showed that the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B was similar in the pre-2021 and post-2021 time periods, at 14% (95% CI: 5-23%) for pre-2021 and 6-22% for 2021 and post-2021. Also, the overall prevalence of influenza A and B in COVID-19 patients is 11% and 4%, and there was no significant difference between the time periods before and after 2021. Meta-regression with a random-effects model showed that the variables location, year group, and total patients showed only 2.71% of very high heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 99.92%), and none of these variables had a significant effect on the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Also, meta-regression results showed that these variables had no significant effect on influenza A and B prevalence (p\u2009>\u20090.05) and showed only a small proportion of the very high heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 99.72%), (I\u00b2 = 68.78%). In our study, Egger's test indicated that there was publication bias or small study effects in this meta-analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.0000).\nCONCLUSION: The combination of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza and other respiratory viruses requires the best treatment protocols to reduce the severity of the disease. In this approach, high vaccination coverage against seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 could reduce the risk of co-infection in the recent pandemic."

            "abstract": "Background Despite ongoing waves of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections, including significant surges such as the 10th wave, understanding the impact of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination on infection risk and associated behavioral changes remains crucial. This study aims to urgently evaluate the effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination on COVID-19 infection rates and related behaviors among participants of the Yamato Project, which includes employees of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Methods A case-control study was conducted using data collected from a survey administered by the Japan Small and Medium Enterprise Management Council in December 2023. Participants included individuals who were part of the Yamato Project, not necessarily limited to SME employees. The survey gathered information on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 infection status, vaccination history, health status before January 2020, and various preventive behaviors. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between vaccination status and COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 913 participants were included in the final analysis. The adjusted ORs for COVID-19 infection among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.33-2.57, p < 0.001). The odds of contracting COVID-19 increased with the number of vaccine doses: one to two doses (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46, p = 0.020), three to four doses (OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.35-3.08, p = 0.001), and five to seven doses (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.07-4.56, p = 0.033). Behavioral analysis indicated that a reduced frequency of bathing and exercising was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 infection rates (p < 0.05). Conclusions The study observed a higher reported incidence of COVID-19 infection among vaccinated individuals during the pandemic period, which increased with the number of vaccine doses received. This paradoxical finding may be influenced by various factors, including immune response mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or original antigenic sin, behavioral changes, and exposure risk. Understanding these factors is crucial for urgently enhancing public health strategies and vaccination programs."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Each of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has its characteristics that can affect their effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and patient mortality. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including whole-virus, protein-based, and vector-based on COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality.\nMETHODS: The current cohort study was conducted using the data of all people who received at least two doses of each type of COVID-19 vaccine from March 2020 to August 2022 in Khorasan Rzavi province. Quantitative data were characterized using measures of central tendency and dispersion, while the risks of infection, hospitalization, and mortality were assessed for each type of vaccine. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate the effect of various vaccine types on infection rate, hospitalization, and mortality while adjusting for other independent variables.\nRESULTS: In this study, over 2\u00a0million vaccinated individuals had received at least two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Whole-virus vaccines, which had an infection rate of 3%, a hospitalization rate of 1.4%, and a mortality rate of 0.2%, were the most effective vaccines. The study also identified several factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory issues, age, sex, diabetes, olfactory dysfunction, fever, chills, body mass index (BMI), and the type of vaccine.\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the substantial impact of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates in Iran. The results support the use of whole-virus and vector-based vaccines as more effective options for preventing COVID-19 outcomes. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering various factors, including medical history and side effects, when evaluating the effectiveness of different vaccine types. The findings of this study can inform public health policy and vaccination strategies in Iran and other countries."

            "abstract": "AIMS: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r) is an orally administered antiviral indicated for the outpatient treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for disease progression to severe illness. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of NMV/r versus best supportive care for 54 patient cohorts, specified according to age, vaccination status and comorbidity burden.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously published and validated cost-effectiveness model was utilized and adapted to the Swedish setting. The model used a short-term decision-tree (1\u2009year) followed by a lifetime 2-state Markov model. The short-term decision-tree captured costs and outcomes associated with the primary infection. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome was only considered in terms of quality-of-life decrements for one year. Baseline hospitalization and mortality risks were taken from a Swedish, nationwide, uniquely granular, Omicron-era, real-world study. NMV/r effectiveness were taken from an Omicron-era US real-world study. Remaining inputs were informed by previous COVID-19 studies and publicly available Swedish sources.\nRESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) showed a large variation ranging from almost nine million SEK for some of the youngest cohorts to being dominant (i.e. cost-saving with higher gains in quality-of-life vs standard of care) for twelve elderly cohorts. In general, higher age in combination with non-recent (>180\u2009days) or no vaccination led to lower ICERs. Specifically, NMV/r was cost-effective for all but one patient cohorts at least 70\u2009years old, and for most patient cohorts 60-69\u2009years old.\nLIMITATIONS: As the COVID-19 landscape changes, symptom burden and baseline risks constantly change. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of NMV/r will change with time. However, the future risks could be related to the risks in the current study, and thus remain useful for decision makers.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that NMV/r is a cost-effective or even cost-saving treatment option for many patient cohorts, including most elderly and not-recently vaccinated patients with at least some comorbidity burden."

            "abstract": "The rapid development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has helped mitigate the initial impact of the pandemic. However, in order to reduce transmission rates and protect more vulnerable and immunocompromised individuals unable to mount an effective immune response, development of a next-generation of mucosal vaccines is necessary. Here, we developed an intranasal Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based vaccine expressing the spike of the XBB.1.5 variant stabilized in its pre-fusion conformation (NDV-HXP-S). We demonstrated that one or two intranasal immunizations with live NDV-HXP-S expressing the XBB.1.5 spike induces systemic and mucosal antibody responses in mice and protects them from a challenge with the XBB.1.5 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, one or two intranasal vaccinations with NDV-HXP-S XBB.1.5 protected hamsters from variant matched infection and reduced virus emission, thereby providing complete protection to na\u00efve animals in a direct contact transmission study. The data shown in this study supports the notion that intranasal vaccination with variant-adapted NDV-HXP-S induces protective mucosal immunity and reduces transmission rates, highlighting the robust protective efficacy of a single mucosal vaccination in mice and hamsters."

The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine on the prognosis of individuals infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2.\nMETHODS: In a single-center, retrospective cohort study, all adult patients with COVID-19 from designated hospital in Xi'an, China, during the Delta outbreak from December 2021 to January 2022 were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they received the COVID-19 vaccine, and differences in clinical outcomes (pneumonia, oxygen therapy, severe disease, and mechanical ventilation or death), symptoms, and nucleic acid-negative time between the two groups were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 651 adult patients with COVID-19 were included, among whom 578 were vaccinated and 73 were not vaccinated. Compared with the unvaccinated group, the vaccinated group had lower rates of pneumonia (49.8% vs. 67.1%; P=0.005), oxygen therapy (20.9% vs. 57.5%; P&lt;0.001), severe illness (1.6% vs. 26.0%; P&lt;0.001), and mechanical ventilation or mortality (0.3% vs. 13.7%; P&lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of requiring oxygen therapy, severe illness, and mechanical ventilation or death. Compared with the unvaccinated group, the vaccinated group had a higher incidence of sore throat (31.8% vs. 17.8%; P=0.01) and a lower incidence of shortness of breath (3.1% vs. 20.5%; P&lt;0.001), diarrhea (1.2% vs. 5.5%; P=0.03), and nausea or vomiting (1.4% vs. 6.8%; P=0.007).

            "abstract": "The epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children has evolved throughout the pandemic, with initially low infection rates rising significantly as a result of the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant. Adolescents, children from ethnic minorities and lower-income households, and those with obesity are at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The immune response in children leads to milder symptoms compared to adults, with fever and cough being most frequent; tough symptoms vary by SARS-CoV-2 variant and age. Diagnostic methods to confirm current or past infection include reverse transcription PCR, rapid antigen tests, and serology. Treatment is mainly supportive, with antivirals and glucocorticoids reserved for severe cases. While serious conditions like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and other post-COVID-19 conditions are rare, they require careful management. Vaccination has proven effective in reducing severe disease and protecting against post-COVID-19 conditions. Continued surveillance, including wastewater monitoring and universal or pooled testing, remains crucial for controlling community spread. Key questions remain regarding the duration and quality of immunity after reinfection or vaccination, the impact of coinfections, and optimal treatment protocols for different pediatric populations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regional variations in SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in Canada and other countries. Studies have used multilevel analyses to examine how a context, such as a neighbourhood, can affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of the people within it. However, few multilevel studies have quantified the magnitude of the general contextual effect (GCE) in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and assessed how it may be associated with individual- and area-level characteristics. To address this gap, we will illustrate the application of the median rate ratio (MRR) in a multilevel Poisson analysis for quantifying the GCE in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in Ontario, Canada.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based, two-level multilevel observational study where individuals were nested into regions (i.e., forward sortation areas [FSAs]). The study population included community-dwelling adults in Ontario, Canada, between March 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021. The model included seven individual-level variables (age, sex, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and four FSA census-based variables (household size, household income, employment, and driving to work). The MRR is a median value of the rate ratios comparing two patients with identical characteristics randomly selected from two different regions ordered by rate. We examined the attenuation of the MRR after including individual-level and FSA census-based variables to assess their role in explaining the variation in rates between regions.\nRESULTS: Of the 11 789 128 Ontario adult community-dwelling residents, 343 787 had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. After adjusting for individual-level and FSA census-based variables, the MRR was attenuated to 1.67 (39% reduction from unadjusted MRR). The strongest FSA census-based associations were household size (RR\u2009=\u20091.88, 95% CI: 1.71-1.97) and driving to work (RR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.65-0.71).\nCONCLUSIONS: The individual- and area-level characteristics in our study accounted for approximately 40% of the between-region variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates measured by MRR in Ontario, Canada. These findings suggest that population-based policies to address social determinants of health that attenuate the MRR may reduce the observed between-region heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates."

The outcomes of the study were (i) rates of in-hospital mortality, (ii) contribution of COVID-19 to death, (iii) histological extent of lung injury and (iv) impact of vaccination.\nRESULTS: A total of 1038 consecutive hospitalized patients who died with SARS-CoV-2 infection were autopsied and deep histological analysis of the lungs was performed in a randomly selected sample of 508 cases. Among them, SARS-CoV-2 infection was (a) the cause of death (n\u2009=\u200990), (b) contributing to death (n\u2009=\u2009304) and (c) an accompanying feature (n\u2009=\u2009114).

Coverage with nearly all vaccines was lower among children born in 2020 and 2021 than it was among those born in 2018 and 2019, with declines ranging from 1.3 to 7.8 percentage points. Analyses of NIS-Child data for earlier birth cohorts have not revealed such widespread declines in routine childhood vaccination coverage. Coverage among children born during 2020-2021 varied by race and ethnicity, health insurance status, poverty status, urbanicity, and jurisdiction. Compared with non-Hispanic White children, coverage with four of the 17 vaccine measures was lower among non-Hispanic Black or African American children as well as Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native children. Coverage was also generally lower among those covered by Medicaid or other nonprivate insurance, uninsured children, children living below the federal poverty level, and children living in rural areas. Coverage varied widely by jurisdiction, especially coverage with \u22652 doses of influenza vaccine. Children born during 2020-2021 were born during or after the period of major disruption of primary care from the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers should review children's histories and recommend needed vaccinations during every clinical encounter. Addressing financial barriers, access issues, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine-related misinformation can also help to increase coverage, reduce disparities, and protect all children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Strategies that have been found effective include implementation of standing orders and reminder and recall systems, strong physician recommendations to vaccinate, and use of immunization information systems to identify areas of lower coverage that could benefit from targeted interventions to increase immunization rates."

We evaluated the BBIBP-CorV vaccine's effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe disease, and mortality during the third wave of the pandemic in Sri Lanka.\nMETHODS: We conducted a test-negative case-control study in North Central Province from May 2021 to February 2022. Evidence of vaccination was obtained from the national registry. The PCR-positive patients were cases, while negative individuals were controls. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) was computed for fully, partially, and non-vaccinated groups in reducing symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, severe disease, and mortality.\nRESULTS: Our study involved 3305 cases and 3418 controls. The overall aVE for preventing PCR-positive infection in fully vaccinated was 30\u00b78\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI:17\u00b79-41\u00b76). In fully vaccinated over 60 years, the overall aVE was 72\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 49\u00b77-84\u00b78). Full vaccination with BBIBP-CorV is effective in reducing hospitalisation, severe COVID-19 disease, and death, with aVE rates of 70\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 57\u00b79-79\u00b70), 88\u00b79\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 81\u00b78-93\u00b72), and 92\u00b73\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 84\u00b78-96\u00b71) respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Individuals who have received two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine are protected against hospitalisation, severe COVID-19 disease, and death. Duration of protection against hospitalisation, severe COVID-19, and fatal COVID-19 sustained at least 121 days, with no sign of waning during that time."

            "abstract": "Gel manicures have become part of a popular personal care service in the last two decades due to increased longevity of the polish and the added strength to the nail plate. Prolonged exposure to nail ultraviolet (UV) lamps is required to cure the gel polish. Despite the increased use of UV nail lamps, there is limited consensus in the literature on the risk of skin malignancy associated with UV nail lamps. The objective of this article was to provide a systematic review of the risk of skin malignancy associated with the use of UV nail lamps and to synthesize evidence-based recommendations on their safe usage. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the databases, Medline and Embase, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 2,331 non-duplicate articles. Nine were ultimately included, of which three were case reports, one was a cross-sectional study, and five were experimental studies. The risk of bias per the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was high or unclear, likely due to the number of case reports included. Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV nail lamps may pose a low risk of skin cancer. It is important to note that the available evidence is weak, and patients should be informed about the limited data to make their own decisions. Dermatologists and other healthcare providers should be updated with the latest evidence to address patients' concerns about gel manicures and suggest practices which can effectively reduce the risk of cutaneous malignancy associated with gel manicures, such as the use of UV-blocking gloves or properly applied sunscreens."

During the healing process, it can cause peeling, irritation, and some long-term effects, including premature aging, pigmentation, and a high risk of skin cancer. Rutin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce inflammation and soothe sunburned skin. The objective of the current proposal is to develop and create carbopol gel-encased glycerosomes for the treatment of sunburn. The Design of Expert (DoE) technique was used to optimize the proposed formulation and was subjected to various characterization parameters such as nanovesicles size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, entrapment efficiency (EE), and surface morphology. The optimized rutin-loaded glycerosomes (opt-RUT-loaded-GMs) were further characterised for drug release, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The formulation showed sustained release, greater permeation into the skin, and good antioxidant activity. The dermatokinetic study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs confirms that the Rutin hydrate had better retention in the epidermis as compared to the dermis, owing to its potential for long lasting protection after topical application. It was observed that the prepared formulation was stable, highly safe, and had good sun protection factor (SPF) values that could be used as a suitable option for topical drug administration to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs."

            "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people worldwide. Anxiety, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, myocardial infarction, and cancer, among other disorders, are known to increase the risk of depression. Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) can cause human serotonin levels to increase. The vitamin D pathway is one mechanism through which ultraviolet light absorbed through the skin can affect mood; however, UVB exposure is known to increase the risk of cancer. In this study, we explored the effects of prolonged exposure to UVB on depression. Data were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 2008 to 2013. Each patient with depression was matched 1:4 with a comparison patient by sex and age (\u00b15 years); thus, the study included 23,579 patients with depression and 94,316 healthy controls for comparison. The patients had been exposed to UVB for at least 1 year to observe the cumulative effect of UVB exposure. Based on the World Health Organization UV index, we divided the observation period data into five UV levels: low, moderate, high, very high, and extreme. A multivariate Poisson regression model was used to assess the risk of depression according to UVB exposure level, adjusting for sex, age, income, urbanization level, month, and comorbidities. The results revealed that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with depression was 0.889 for moderate levels (95% CI 0.835-0.947), 1.134 for high levels (95% CI: 1.022-1.260), 1.711 for very high levels (95% CI: 1.505-1.945), and 2.785 for extreme levels (95% CI: 2.439-3.180) when compared to low levels. Moderate levels of UVB lowered the risk of depression, while high levels of UVB gradually increased the risk. We propose that UVB at normal concentrations can effectively improve depression. However, exposure to high concentrations of UVB damage DNA results in physical diseases such as skin cancer, which increase the risk of depression."

However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2\u202fmg/cm2; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4\u202fh): 1\u202fmg/cm2 each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures.\nRESULTS: Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11\u202f\u03bcg/L, 25\u202f\u03bcg/L and 1352\u202f\u03bcg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207\u202f\u03bcg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16\u202fh after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2\u202fdays. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC.\nDISCUSSION: Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites."

The Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) was introduced as a tool to visualize the intensity of UV radiation on a certain day, which should enable and encourage people to take appropriate protective measures. The 'low' exposure category of the UVI, defined by a rounded UVI value of 0, 1 or 2, was linked to the health message 'No protection required' by the World Health Organization and partner organizations. However, published evidence corroborating this advice is not available. To evaluate the erythemal risk of low UVI days, we analyzed 14,431 daily time series of ambient erythemal irradiance data measured at nine stations of the German solar UV monitoring network during the years 2007-2016. We analyzed the proportion of days in the sample for which ambient erythemal doses calculated for various time intervals exceed average minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of the Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I-VI to assess the potential for erythema arising from sun exposure on days with low UVI values. Additionally, we calculated for each day the minimum exposure duration needed to receive one MED. Our results indicate that on days with a UVI value of 0, risk of erythema is indeed negligible. Conversely, the abovementioned health message appears misleading when melano-compromised individuals (skin type I and II) spend more than 1.5 hours outdoors on days with a UVI value of 2. Under rare circumstances of prolonged exposure, MEDs of the two most sensitive skin types can also be exceeded even on days with a UVI value of 1. Hence, current WHO guidance for sun protection on days with low UVI values needs reconsideration."

Therefore, the application of sunscreen has gained much attention to reduce the harmful effects of UV irradiation on our skin. Recently, there has been a growing demand for the replacement of chemical sunscreens with natural UV-absorbing compounds. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), promising alternative natural UV-absorbing compounds, are a group of widely distributed, low molecular-weight, water-soluble molecules that can absorb UV radiation and disperse the absorbed energy as heat, without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). More than 30 MAAs have been characterized, from a variety of organisms. In addition to their UV-absorbing properties, there is substantial evidence that MAAs have the potential to protect against skin aging, including antioxidative activity, anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of protein-glycation, and inhibition of collagenase activity. This review will provide an overview of MAAs, as potential anti-aging ingredients, beginning with their structure, before moving on to discuss the most recent experimental observations, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which MAAs might protect the skin. In particular, we focus on the potential anti-aging activity of mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G)."

Here, we describe that tomato consumption can modulate risk for keratinocyte carcinomas; however, the role of the newly identified specific phytochemicals possibly responsible for this action require further investigation."

There is a growing interest in the prevention of skin cancer and antiaging treatment because of aging of the population. Currently, ablative fractional photothermolysis (FP) laser treatment is actively being performed for facial rejuvenation.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prove the suppressive effect of CO2 fractional laser (FL) on skin cancer development.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of hairless mice were treated with either CO2 FL or nothing at 3-week intervals during the 20 weeks of UV exposure period. The number of tumors was subsequently counted every 2 weeks over the 30-week period to the termination of the experiment. At 30 weeks, representative tumors were evaluated for tumor type. The authors also determined the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and Type 1 procollagen.\nRESULTS: At 30 weeks, the UV- and FL-treated group showed a significantly lower tumor occurrence rate and a more benign progression of tumors than the UV-only treated group. The UV- and FL-treated group presented a higher mRNA level of Type 1 procollagen and a lower level of MMP-13 than the UV-only treated group.\nCONCLUSION: The occurrence of UV-induced skin tumors can be decreased by multiple sessions of ablative FP with CO2 laser."

Using a two-chamber model, we show that UVA-exposed target cells induce intercellular oxidative signaling to non-irradiated bystander cells. This UVA-mediated bystander stress is observed between all three cutaneous cell types (i.e., keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts). Significantly, melanocytes appear to be more resistant to direct UVA effects compared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, although melanocytes are also more susceptible to bystander oxidative signaling. The extensive intercellular flux of oxidative species has not been previously appreciated and could possibly contribute to the observed cancer risk associated with prolonged UVA exposure."

Furthermore, studies have not investigated whether sun exposure at different periods in the lifetime of a person results in differences in risk associations, and little is known about differences according to histological subtype.\nMETHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of 1,334 non-Hispanic white women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer in western Washington State between 2002 and 2009 and 1,679 non-Hispanic white controls, we assessed the relation of epithelial ovarian cancer with constitutional pigmentation characteristics, sun exposure behaviors, and an index of ultraviolet (UV) exposure based on residential history. Information was collected through in-person interviews. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and trend p values (P(trend)).\nRESULTS: We noted no association with residence-based measures of UV exposure or self-reported sun exposure, either over the lifetime or within specific age intervals. Also, we observed little evidence of association between constitutional pigmentation characteristics and risk, save for a suggestion of increased risk among women who reported increased ability to suntan upon prolonged sun exposure (P(trend) = 0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that sun exposure has little influence on the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Additional studies in populations with a wider gradient of sun exposure may yet be warranted."

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact on hospital staff behaviour with regard to UV of screening campaigns initiated in Belgium 11 years ago.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a multicentre, before-after study by sending an anonymous survey to the staff of four hospital in Brussels, from March 2010 to April 2010 (group 2: n=895). Demographic, clinical and behavioural data were collected and compared to those collected 23 years ago in the same hospitals (group 1: n=2410).\nRESULTS: Phototypes in both groups were similar. In group 2, the distribution of naevi tended to be spread over the whole body and the severity of sunburn had decreased. Group 2 participants reported a reduction in active sun exposure, especially in the past 10 years, with less leisure-time tanning. There was a significant increase in holidays in sunny locations, although vacation time was shorter, with prolonged daily and annual exposure. Sunscreens were more frequently used and there was an increase in sun-bed use, especially in beauty parlours.\nCONCLUSION: Our study comprises a double snapshot of a population of hospital workers at an interval of 23 years. The information and screening campaigns do not seem to have had the desired effect on the hospital staff surveyed. Sunscreen use has in fact resulted in extended UV exposure and the observed exposure pattern is that most frequently involved in melanoma development."

            "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure accounts for only 40-50% of the attributable risk for cutaneous melanoma (CM); also classical UV-induced lesions are rare in melanomas (especially among CM with NRAS or BRAF mutations). It is therefore likely that an additional environmental factor exists as familial and genetic factors play a role in less than 5%. A large amount of (largely forgotten) epidemiologic data indicates that heavy metal exposure is strongly associated with the development of CM. Also, epidemiologic studies of patients with joint replacement indicate a marked subsequent time-related increase in melanoma in patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties. In these patients chromium and cobalt levels rise to 10x normal and stay elevated at levels two- to threefold normal for at least 10 years. Chromium is widely used in industry for its anticorrosive and steel-strengthening properties and is widespread in everyday materials. Our hypothesis is therefore that chromium, alone or in conjunction with UV, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CM. We have incubated human neonatal melanocytes for more than 10 weeks in the presence of a wide range and concentrations of metals without effect except by hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)and to a lesser degree Co\u00b2(+). After prolonged culture, chromium-incubated cells produced foci and when replated secondary colonies formed. We have just begun to study this phenomenon in more detail and studies without and with different wavelengths of UV will be explored. Of interest is that aneuploidy (a universal chromosomal change in cutaneous melanoma) in lymphocytes in patients with hip-on-hip metal prostheses has been demonstrated by others."

A better understanding of NMSC epidemiology in Europe is essential if an evidence-based European-wide public health policy is to be developed. It is obvious this can only be achieved by recording and analysing comparative epidemiological data.

            "abstract": "THE CONTEXT: With the improvement in transplant in surgery, organ storage techniques and immunosuppressive treatments, the number of organ transplant recipients is regularly increasing. To preserve the activity of the graft, immunosuppressive treatment is required for life in most cases, leading to prolonged immunodeficiency. These patients exhibit an increased risk of cancer, notably of tumors associated with viruses such as carcinomas, Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas. THE DIFFERENT CANCERS CONCERNED: Cutaneous cancers, notably squamous cell carcinomas, are the predominant cancers encountered in transplant recipients and affect around half of the patients within 20 years following the transplant. Squamous cell carcinomas tend to be multiple, may be life-threatening, and appear to predict the onset of other cancers. Exposure to UV, immunosuppression, the relatively old age at the time of the transplant, light skinned phototype, genetic factors and papillomavirus infections are all factors of risk. Other photo-induced tumors, such as melanoma, some sarcomas or Merkel cell carcinomas also appear increased and of severe prognosis. MEASURES OF PREVENTION: The prevalence of these tumors could be reduced by educating the patients on strict sun-protection measures following the transplant. The factors enhancing Kaposi's sarcoma associated with the HHV8 virus remain to be defined. The possibility of transmission of the infection through the graft must lead to the systematic search for this virus in the donors."

Opossums were weighed weekly; samples for serum chemistry and hematology testing were obtained periodically. Complete postmortem examinations revealed a primary cause of death for each opossum. Meaningful differences among the groups in weight gain, serum chemistry values or hematology values were not seen. Significant life-shortening due to UV-radiation exposure was found for females but not males. Photoreactivation prolonged life only in the females exposed to UV radiation. Exposure to UV radiation was not associated with accelerated development of degenerative disease. Significant treatment-related mortality occurred in both male and female opossums exposed to UV radiation. Photoreactivation reduced the relative risk of skin tumors but not eye tumors in Monodelphis exposed to UV radiation. Eye and skin tumors were less likely to be a cause of death in UV-radiation-exposed opossums subsequently exposed to PRL than in opossums exposed to UV radiation alone.

As early surgical removal of the melanoma is the only effective therapy, current strategies for reducing mortality from melanoma focus on prevention of the disease. Chemical sunscreens protect mice from development of skin cancers that resemble sunlight-induced human squamous cell cancers, but there appears to be a complex relationship between UV radiation exposure and development of melanoma.\nPURPOSE: We asked whether common sunscreens would protect mice against UV radiation-induced enhancement of melanoma incidence.\nMETHODS: C3H mice were exposed to 4.8 kJ/m2 UVB from FS40 sunlamps twice a week for 3 weeks. Sunscreens containing 7.5% 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, 8% octyl-N-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoate, 6% benzophenone-3, or the oil-in-water vehicle alone were applied to the ears and tails of the mice 20 minutes before irradiation. At various times during and after exposure, we determined UV radiation-induced inflammation by measuring ear swelling. We also examined the ears histologically for UV radiation-induced alterations. One day after the final irradiation, 2.5 x 10(4) syngeneic K1735 melanoma cells were injected into the external ears. Mice were examined weekly for tumor growth for 5-8 weeks after tumor cell injection. Control mice were treated in the identical way except for exposure to UV radiation.\nRESULTS: The incidence of melanomas was significantly higher in the UV-irradiated mice. All three sunscreens protected against UV radiation-induced ear swelling and clearly diminished histopathologic alterations, including sunburn cell formation, epidermal hyperplasia, and mononuclear cell infiltrate in the dermis. However, the sunscreens failed to protect against UV radiation-induced increase in melanoma incidence. The sunscreens or vehicle alone did not significantly alter tumor growth.\nCONCLUSIONS: Protection against sunburn does not necessarily imply protection against other possible UV radiation effects, such as enhanced melanoma growth.\nIMPLICATIONS: Sunscreen protection against UV radiation-induced inflammation may encourage prolonged exposure to UV radiation and thus may actually increase the risk of melanoma development. These findings suggest that further research on the ability of sunscreens to prevent melanoma is urgently needed."

Analytical epidemiology has not reached a consensus on this aspect. Experimental data available are also difficult to interpret because there are consistent differences of susceptibility to UV among different animals, among lamps used and methods of measuring employed in various laboratories. Information available shows that the maximal relative biological activity of UV in humans is at about 305 nm. This evaluation greatly depends on (1) thickness of the skin, (2) the quantity and quality of secretions that cover the skin, (3) cleanness of the skin, (4) the latitude, (5) the weather, (6) the hour of the day and (7) the presence of chemical carcinogens in the air and on the skin.

The effectiveness of decontamination procedures outside experimental settings is unclear. We examined the prevalence of surface contamination on reusable PPE used by HCWs at a hospital incorporating daily centralized decontamination and post-use wiping by sampling for common pathogens.\nMETHOD: Samples were collected from HCWs' CleanSpace Halo respirator face masks (FMs) and FSs at the start of shift, immediately after use, and after cleaning with disinfecting wipes. Samples were analyzed for pathogens using the Applied Biosystems\u2122 TaqPath\u2122 COVID-19 Combo Kit and ThermoFisher TaqMan Array Card. Patient charts were reviewed for clinical correlation.\nFINDINGS: Of the 89 samples, 51 from FMs and 38 from FSs, none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, despite 58 being obtained from PPE used in the care of patients with COVID-19, many with recent aerosol-generating procedures. Four samples tested positive (4.5%) for Staphylococcus aureus, two each from FMs and FSs. FMs that tested positive were not worn concurrently with FSs that tested positive. The FM and FS samples testing positive were worn in the care of patients without diagnosed S. aureus infection. No FMs tested positive following wipe-based disinfection, but both positive FS samples were found after disinfection wiping.\nCONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Contamination of reusable PPE appears uncommon, especially with SARS-CoV-2, when regular decontamination programs are in place. The rare presence of S. aureus highlights the importance of doffing procedures and hand hygiene by HCW to prevent surface contamination."

Given reports of similar transmission mechanisms for COVID-19 and seasonal coronaviruses, we investigated whether hand hygiene impacted the risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infections. Methods: Data were drawn from three successive winter cohorts (2006-2009) of the England-wide Flu Watch study. \u00a0Participants ( n=1633) provided baseline estimates of hand hygiene behaviour. Coronavirus infections were identified from nasal swabs using RT-PCR. Poisson mixed models estimated the effect of hand hygiene on personal risk of coronavirus illness, both unadjusted and adjusted for confounding by age and healthcare worker status. Results: Moderate-frequency handwashing (6-10 times per day) predicted a lower personal risk of coronavirus infection (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) =0.64, p=0.04). There was no evidence for a dose-response effect of handwashing, with results for higher levels of hand hygiene (&gt;10 times per day) not significant (aIRR =0.83, p=0.42).

Regular and proper hand hygiene by caregivers and food handlers in particular is essential to decontaminate hands and potentially interrupt such spread. What would be considered a proper decontamination of hands? Handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? Are they more effective? The evidence suggests that some clearly are. Activity against bacteria may not reflect the ability of hygienic hand antiseptics to deal with viruses, especially those that are nonenveloped. In spite of the acknowledged importance of hands as vehicles for viruses, there is a lack of suitable regulatory mechanism for handwash or handrub products to make claims of efficacy against viruses. This is in contrast with the ability of general-purpose disinfectants to make antiviral claims, although transmission of viruses from surfaces other than those of reusable medical devices may play only a minor role in virus transmission.

However, clinical studies reporting the limited efficacy of HDL or its main apolipoprotein, APOA1, in reducing cardiovascular events have emerged. Although HDL cholesterol is unlikely to play a direct causal role in CVD, its inverse, albeit modest, association with CVD risk, consistently observed in large population studies, suggests it may influence alternative pathways beyond cholesterol metabolism. Given the diverse functions of HDL and its components, it is conceivable that its impact on CVD occurs through less direct mechanisms. A potential hypothesis is that HDL modulates platelet function, a crucial player in the initiation and progression of atherothrombosis, which may contribute to its observed relationship with CVD risk.

A restricted cubic spline regression model was used to evaluate the dose-response association, and ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive ability of individual and combined indicators (AIP and BMI). Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the association between AIP, BMI, and sarcopenia risk across different demographic groups.\nRESULTS: The cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with various factors, including age, marital status, education level, residence, smoking, BMI, uric acid (UA), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), AIP, as well as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart disease (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, revealed that the low AIP group was significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia (OR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02), while no significant difference was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.01, p\u2009=\u20090.07). In the retrospective cohort study, the low AIP group showed a positive association with sarcopenia risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.79, 95% CI 1.18-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and a similar trend was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.77, p\u2009=\u20090.04). BMI was inversely associated with sarcopenia incidence, consistent with the cross-sectional findings. Both AIP and BMI showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship with sarcopenia risk, with AIP approximating a U-shaped curve and BMI approximating an L-shaped curve. Subgroup analysis indicated that, in the 65-69 age group, low AIP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia. In participants aged 70 and above, as well as in females, both low and high AIP levels were significantly associated with higher incidence risk. ROC curve analysis showed that the combined use of AIP and BMI for predicting sarcopenia had an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8913, which was moderately better than the use of AIP (0.6499) or BMI (0.8888) alone.\nCONCLUSION: The changes in AIP and BMI are associated with the risk of sarcopenia, and both provide some predictive value for sarcopenia. Taken together, the combined prediction using AIP and BMI appears to be somewhat more effective than using either indicator alone in assessing the risk of sarcopenia."

Current evidence is insufficient to establish this association, yet it holds critical importance for healthcare and public health. Research into the link between ALI and all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis remains a topic of interest.\nOBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between ALI and all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients, and explored the clinical significance of this association.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2007 and 2018, involving 4502 adult participants with MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis in the United States. Data collected included age, sex, race, education, marital status, poverty-to-income ratio, alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between ALI and all-cause mortality, with follow-up through 31 December 2019, from the National Center for Health Statistics.\nRESULTS: The study found that ALI in patients was significantly negatively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality in U.S. adults with MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis. Participants with higher ALI levels had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with lower ALI levels. After full adjustment, moderate ALI levels were associated with a 42% reduced risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.81), and high ALI levels were associated with a 49% reduced risk (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73) of all-cause mortality. No significant interactions were observed in subgroup analyses (P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggested that high ALI levels are associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients. These findings may have important clinical implications for healthcare providers managing MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis patients, emphasizing the potential role of ALI as a prognostic marker for all-cause mortality."

The data of CHD was obtained through a questionnaire survey, and the DII was calculated using 24-h dietary recall data. Generalized linear models and logistic regression were used to determine the mediation factors, and subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the interaction between DII and CHD. Mean decrease in Gini (MDG) was used to determine the importance of individual dietary components.\nRESULTS: The age of the participants was 49.81\u202f\u00b1\u202f18.10\u202fyears, with 20,793 (47.4%) being male. A total of 1,892 (4.3%) participants were diagnosed with CHD, and the median DII score was 1.33 (0.11, 2.40). After adjusting for potential confounders, logistic regression analysis revealed that DII independently associated with CHD [OR: 1.049 (1.012-1.087), p\u202f=\u202f0.008]. Triglyceride-glucose index, visceral adiposity index, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio, high-density lipoprotein, and glomerular filtration rate (all p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.05) may mediate the relationship between DII and CHD. Subgroup analyses showed that DII was more sensitive in participants aged &lt;75\u202fyears (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001), females (p\u202f=\u202f0.028), those with low cholesterol levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.004), and individuals with low Framingham risk scores (p\u202f=\u202f0.005). MDG analysis indicated that carbohydrate, vitamin C and iron intake have the greatest impact on CHD.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that various metabolic and lipid indicators play a mediating role in the relationship between DII and CHD. DII may have a greater adverse impact on traditional low-risk CHD populations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited research on the relationship between the triglyceride-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and outcomes in new-onset heart failure (HF). Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between TG/HDL-C ratio and clinical outcomes in these patients.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort of 614 adults with new-onset HF hospitalized at The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between July 2021 and December 2022 was analyzed. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular (CV) death and HF rehospitalizations within 12 months after discharge. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and Cox regression evaluated the association between TG/HDL-C ratio and MACE risk.\nRESULTS: Patients were divided into four quartiles (Quartile 1, 2,3 and 4) based on their TG/HDL-C ratios. The mean age was 68.94\u2009\u00b1\u200914.34 years, with 59.12% male. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 46.59\u2009\u00b1\u200910.89%, with 45.11% having an LVEF\u2009\u2264\u200940%. During the 12-month follow-up, 156 patients experienced MACE, comprising 18 CV deaths and 138 HF rehospitalizations. The Quartile 4 group had the highest MACE risk incidence compared to other groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). K-M analysis confirmed that the Quartile 4 group was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of MACE, HF rehospitalization, and CV death (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). RCS analysis revealed a positive nonlinear relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and MACE risk (P for nonlinear\u2009=\u20090.026), with a sharp risk increase above a ratio of 1.08. After adjustment, TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with MACE (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29-1.60). Compared to Quartile 1, adjusted HRs were significantly higher in Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 (all P\u2009<\u20090.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TG/HDL-C ratio is independently associated with 12-month MACE risk in new-onset HF patients. It may serve as a simple, cost-effective marker to improve early risk stratification and guide closer monitoring and tailored management in this high-risk population."

SHR-1918 is a fully human monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL-3.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of SHR-1918 in patients at moderate or higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with suboptimally controlled hyperlipidemia.\nMETHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the effects of SHR-1918 in hypercholesterolemic patients, who did not achieve optimal LDL-C after 4 to 8\u00a0weeks of standard lipid-lowering therapies. A total of 333 patients were enrolled sequentially into 1 of 8 dose cohorts at a 4:1 (active/placebo) ratio. Patients received subcutaneous SHR-1918 at doses of 150, 300, or 600\u00a0mg every 4\u00a0weeks (Q4W), or SHR-1918 at a dose of 600\u00a0mg every 8\u00a0weeks (Q8W), alternating with placebo for a total treatment period of 16\u00a0weeks. The extension treatment included subcutaneous SHR-1918 at a dose of 150, 300, or 600\u00a0mg Q4W over 36\u00a0weeks, or SHR-1918 a dose of 600\u00a0mg Q8W over 40\u00a0weeks and then followed for safety. Prespecified endpoints included percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG. Safety was assessed with laboratory test results and by the incidence and severity of adverse events.\nRESULTS: SHR-1918 demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship with respect to percentage LDL-C lowering for both Q4W and Q8W administration: 21.7%, 27.3%, and 29.9% with 150, 300, and 600\u00a0mg Q4W compared with placebo, respectively, and 22.5% with 600\u00a0mg Q8W compared with placebo. SHR-1918 also substantially reduced TG, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A1, with a better achievement of LDL-C targets. SHR-1918 was generally well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on standard lipid-lowering therapy, ANGPTL-3 inhibition with SHR-1918 further reduces LDL-C by 21.7% to 29.9% in patients at moderate or higher risk of ASCVD. These additional reductions are both dose and dosing frequency dependent. (Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SHR-1918 in Patients With Hyperlipidemic; NCT06109831)."

The main source of energy in such diets is fat but the composition of nutrients varies This study aims to investigate dietary variations in a real-world LCHF population and its associations with cardiovascular risk factors.\nMETHODS: We recruited 100 volunteers who considered themselves adherent to a LCHF diet. Their last 14 days of dietary intake was assessed using diet history interviews. Validation of energy intake against expenditure was made using activity monitors. Predictive variables for the linear regression models were selected using stepwise bidirectional assessment of Akaike information criterion (AIC).\nRESULTS: Energy intake (E%) from carbohydrates was low, 8.7\u00a0E%, and fat was the main replacement. Dietary cholesterol was associated with higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Dietary sodium intake was associated with higher blood pressure. Protein intake was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure but also with lower HDL. The intake of dietary fibre was associated with lower LDL and total cholesterol but with higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The intake of carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids (SFA) was not associated with any of the outcome variables.\nCONCLUSION: In this LCHF population, variations in intake of carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids could not predict any aspects of the cardiovascular risk profile. Lower fibre intake and higher cholesterol and sodium intake predicted a less favorable cardiovascular risk profile."

Here we investigated whether the plasma levels of lipid species are causally linked to disease risk.\nMETHODS: We built genetic predictors of 179 lipid species, measured in 7174 Finnish individuals, by utilising either 11\u00a0high-impact genomic loci or genome-wide polygenic scores (PGS). We assessed the impact of the lipid species on seven diseases by performing disease association across FinnGen (n\u00a0=\u00a0500,348), UK Biobank (n\u00a0=\u00a0420,531), and Generation Scotland (n\u00a0=\u00a020,032). We performed univariable Mendelian randomisation (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses to examine whether lipid species impact disease risk independently of standard lipids.\nFINDINGS: PGS explained >4% of the variance for 34 lipid species but variants outside the high-impact loci had only a marginal contribution. Variants within the high-impact loci showed association with all seven diseases. MVMR supported a causal role of ApoB in ischaemic heart disease after accounting for lipid species. Phosphatidylethanolamine-increasing LIPC variants seemed to lower age-related macular degeneration risk independently of HDL-cholesterol. MVMR suggested a protective effect of four lipid species containing arachidonic acid on cholelithiasis risk independently of Total Cholesterol.\nINTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates how genetic predictors of lipid species can be utilised to gain insights into disease risk. We report potential links between lipid species and age-related macular degeneration and cholelithiasis risk, which can be explored for their utility in disease risk prediction and therapy.\nFUNDING: The funders had no role in the study design, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of this article."

Other disorders related to MetS could help assess the comprehensive risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to update the prevalence rates of MetS and to assess its relationship with other disorders and clinical conditions other than the criteria defining MetS. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with a random population-based sample of 6588 study subjects between 18 and 102 years of age. Crude and sex- and age-adjusted prevalence rates of MetS were calculated, and their associations with comorbidities and clinical conditions other than their defining criteria were assessed by bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The adjusted prevalence rates were 36.0% for MetS (39.8% in men; 33.5% in women), 21.5% for premorbid Mets, and 14.5% for morbid MetS. Considering only clinical conditions other than the criteria defining MetS, the independent disorders associated with premorbid MetS were hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, high levels of lipid accumulation product, high triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), high visceral adiposity index, high fatty liver index, and high waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), highlighting excess adiposity (EA). The independent disorders associated with morbid MetS were hypercholesterolaemia, high-WtHR, EA, high-TyG index, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, CKD, and albuminuria, highlighting hypertension. Conclusions: One-fifth of the adult population has premorbid MetS, and almost one-sixth has morbid MetS. Almost two-fifths of people with MetS are at moderate, high, or very high risk of CKD, and four-fifths are at high or very high cardiovascular risk. In addition to the criteria defining MetS, other cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disorders show an independent association with MetS, highlighting EA for premorbid MetS and hypertension for morbid MetS."

In Malaysia, CVDs account for 20.79% of deaths in government hospitals. Key risk factors include high blood sugar levels, elevated blood pressure, and increased cholesterol levels. Atherosclerosis frequently serves as the underlying condition for coronary heart disease (CHD), with CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 playing a crucial role in recruiting immune cells to inflammation sites. Early diagnosis of CVDs risk is important for preventing severe complications. This crosssectional study aims to investigate the relationship between biomarker CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression levels and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) categories in a Malaysian cohort.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 333 patients from the Family Medicine Specialist Clinic at Hospital Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah were recruited between March 2022 and February 2023. Blood samples were taken after a 12-hour fasting period, and levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were measured. 150 plasma samples were randomly selected for cytokine analysis of CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 using the Human Magnetic Luminex Assay. Patients' cardiovascular risk was assessed using the FRS calculator. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the relationship between cytokine levels and FRS categories, followed by a post hoc test with Bonferroni correction. A logistic regression model was implemented to assess the independent effects of these variables.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant association between the level of chemokines CCL2 and proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1, and FRS categories (low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk). CCL2 levels were notably higher in the high-risk group, as were TNF-\u03b1 levels, with both biomarkers showing increasing trends with higher risk categories, (p<0.001, effect size=0.32) and (p<0.001, effect size-0.29), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that dyslipidaemia, FBS, and TNF-\u03b1 remained significant after adjusting for other variables. Specifically, dyslipidaemia had lower odds of being in the high-risk group (AOR: 0.04), while FBS (AOR: 3.19) and TNF-\u03b1 (AOR: 1.18).\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 as biomarkers for CVDs risk assessment. Integrating these biomarkers into CVDs risk prediction models may enhance the precision of identifying individuals at elevated risk. However, the study's cross-sectional design and small sample size for cytokine analysis constrain the findings. Future research should explore the long-term predictive value of these cytokines in larger, longitudinal cohorts and explore more advanced techniques for improving CHD risk prediction models."

This study aimed to identify distinct clusters of individuals with type 2 diabetes who have varying risks of MACE using a data-driven clustering approach.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 49,506 individuals within a multicenter, population-based primary care registry in Catalonia, Spain. Individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 35 or older were recruited between January 2010 and December 2021 and followed for at least 10\u00a0years. Biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk-including serum glucose, HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, serum ferritin, leukocyte, and monocyte counts-were examined. Clustering analysis was applied to identify patient subgroups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations with cerebrovascular events, coronary events, and composite MACE.\nRESULTS: Five distinct clusters were identified, characterized by differences in serum glucose, HbA1c, lipid profiles, blood pressure, and serum ferritin levels. Individuals with discordantly high serum ferritin levels relative to their body mass index (BMI) exhibited a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In men, hazard ratios (HR) were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.87) for cerebrovascular events, 0.65 (95% CI 0.49-0.88) for coronary events, and 0.68 (95% CI 0.56-0.83) for MACE. In women, HRs were 0.81 (95% CI 0.67-0.92) for cerebrovascular events, 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.95) for coronary events, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.92) for MACE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes who exhibit higher-than-expected serum ferritin levels relative to their BMI may have a lower risk of cardiovascular events. These findings suggest that ferritin may play a more complex role in cardiovascular risk than previously assumed and highlight the potential for refined risk stratification strategies in type 2 diabetes management."

Conclusions: The predictors of prolonged LOHS in patients with HT include lower levels of LDL-c, elevated hsCRP, and the interaction between sex and heart failure (HF). Specifically, female patients with HF demonstrated significantly higher odds of prolonged LOHS compared to females without HF, while this relationship was not observed in male patients."

            "title": "Association between Intestinal Flora Metabolites and Coronary Artery Vulnerable Plaque Characteristics in Coronary Heart Disease.",
            "abstract": "Aims/Background The incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been increasing annually. Patients with severe conditions may die from myocardial infarction, heart failure or malignant arrhythmia. Intestinal flora plays an important role in various metabolic processes, such as atherosclerosis, tumour formation, and inflammation. However, its direct role in promoting plaque vulnerability must be further explored and validated. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between changes in intestinal flora, its metabolites in CHD patients and the vulnerability characteristics of coronary plaques. Methods This study recruited 180 subjects, among these, 90 CHD patients diagnosed between January 2023 and January 2024 were selected as the CHD group and 90 healthy volunteers were selected as the control group following a principle of 1:1 ratio. The differences in intestinal flora composition, metabolite levels, and blood biochemical indexes were compared between the two study groups. Based on the coronary angiography (CAG) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) results, the CHD group was divided into two sub-groups for stratified comparative analysis: the stable plaque group (n = 49) and the vulnerable plaque group (n = 41). Results The CHD group had reduced intestinal Bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria counts and higher intestinal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus levels than the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) levels were significantly higher in the CHD group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the CHD group exhibited substantially elevated serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to the control group. However, compared to the control group, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in the CHD group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Scr) were comparable in the two experimental groups (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, intestinal Bifidobacteria, lactic acid bacteria, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus compositions were comparable in CHD patients with vulnerable plaque and those with stable plaque (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, CHD patients with vulnerable plaque had elevated TMAO and PAGln levels than those with stable plaque (p &lt; 0.05). However, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, ALT, AST, BUN, and Scr levels were comparable between CHD patients with a vulnerable plaque and those with stable plaque (p &gt; 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes, elevated TMAO levels, and elevated PAGln levels were potential risk factors for coronary plaque vulnerability (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion In summary, CHD patients exhibit significant intestinal flora imbalance, with elevated TMAO and PAGln metabolite levels, which are related to the characteristics of plaque instability."

However, there are quite limited studies on the association between AIP and incident CVD among adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the Sleep Heart Health Study, including 2578 participants with OSA and without pre-existing CVD. AIP was calculated as lg (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Baseline AIP was stratified into quartiles (Q1-Q4). Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were performed to examine the relationship between AIP and CVD.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.67 years, 580 (22.50\u00a0%) OSA patients developed CVD, including 184 (7.10\u00a0%) with myocardial infarction (MI), and 400 (15.50\u00a0%) with coronary artery disease (CHD [including MI]), and 127 (4.90\u00a0%) with stroke. The multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses demonstrated a significant association between AIP and incidence of CVD, CHD, and MI, but not stroke. Compared with Q1 group, the fully adjusted odds ratios from Q2\u2009group\u2009to Q4 group were: 1.33 (0.98, 1.80), 1.41 (1.03, 1.92), and 1.54 (1.12,\u20092.14) for CVD; 1.71 (1.04,\u20092.86), 1.92 (1.17,\u20093.21), and 2.01 (1.19,\u20093.45) for MI; 1.48 (1.04,\u20092.11), 1.68 (1.18,\u20092.40), and 1.70 (1.18,\u20092.47) for CHD.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that higher AIP level is associated with incident CVD, except stroke, independent of OSA severity and hypoxia among OSA patients. These findings suggest that monitoring AIP can facilitate the early identification of OSA patients at high risk of CVD."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging genetic and observational evidence indicates that remnant cholesterol (RC) is a significant residual risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a relative paucity of evidence exploring the correlation among RC, lipid ratios, and atherosclerotic lesion severity. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of RC and lipid ratios alone or in combination for the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\nMETHODS: The Gensini score was used to assess the severity of coronary atherosclerotic lesions. CHD patients were categorized into mild stenosis and moderate-to-severe stenosis groups. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk of a high Gensini score associated with RC and lipid ratios. Our study also examined the relationship between inconsistencies in RC and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels and the severity of coronary artery stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive power of RC and lipid ratios alone or in combination for moderate to severe coronary artery lesions.\nRESULTS: Multivariate regression models suggested that RC was a strong predictor of moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis [odds ratio (OR): 5.44, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001]. When grouped by curve-fitting inflection points, the group with inconsistent high RC/low non-HDL-C, rather than the low RC/high non-HDL-C group, was associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe coronary stenosis compared with the consistent low RC group (OR: 2.72, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). ROC curves showed that RC predicted an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.715 for coronary stenosis severity, improving the predictive efficacy of the combined predictors comprising lipid ratios (AUC: 0.723 vs. 0.703, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: RC and various lipid ratios [triglyceride/HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/HDL-C, and apoloprotein (apo)B/apoA] correlated with the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with CHD, suggesting that RC has potential value as a biomarker reflecting the degree of coronary artery stenosis independent of the traditional risk factors and the levels of non-HDL-C. This could enhance the predictive efficacy based on the lipid ratio model and had better predictive value for moderate to severe coronary artery lesions."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is used for stroke prevention in AF, but it also increases bleeding risk. Clinical guidelines do not definitively recommend for or against OAC for patients with borderline stroke risk. Decision-making may benefit from values clarification exercises to communicate risk trade-offs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate if a visual with a values clarification alters the understanding of the trade-offs of anticoagulation in AF.\nMETHODS: Participants aged 45-64 years were recruited across the United States via an online survey. While answering the survey, they were asked to imagine they were newly diagnosed with AF with a CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age \u226575 years [doubled]; type 2 diabetes; previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism [doubled]; vascular disease; age 65 to 75 years; and sex category) score of 1 for men and 2 for women. Eligibility criteria included no diagnosis of AF and no prior OAC use. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: (1) standard text-based information only (n=255), (2) visual aids showing stroke-risk probabilities (n=218), or (3) visual aids plus a values clarification exercise (visual+VC; n=200). Participants were subrandomized within the 2 visual-based groups to view either a gauge display or an icon array representing stroke risk. All participants read a hypothetical scenario of being newly diagnosed with AF and hypertension. The primary outcome was decision confidence as measured by the SURE (Sure of Myself; Understand Information; Risk-Benefit Ratio; Encouragement) test. Secondary measures included participants' perceived stroke risk reduction, worry about stroke or bleeding, and likelihood to choose OAC.\nRESULTS: A total of 673 participants completed the survey. The overall SURE test was 61.2% (156/255) for the standard, 66.5% (145/218) for the visual, and 67% (134/200) for the visual+VC group (visual vs standard P=.23; visual+VC vs standard P=.20). Participants were less likely to choose OAC in the visual groups (standard: mean 58.3, SD 30; visual: mean 51.4, SD 32; visual+VC: 51.9, SD 28; P=.03). Participants felt the reduction in stroke risk from an OAC was less in the visual groups (standard: mean 63.8, SD 22; visual: mean 54.2, SD 28; visual+VC: mean 58.6, SD 25; P<.001). Visualization methods (gauge vs icon array) showed no significant differences in overall SURE test results. Participants were less likely to choose OAC and perceived a smaller stroke risk reduction with gauge than icon array (OAC choice: gauge 48.8, icon array 55.4; P=.03; stroke risk reduction: gauge 52.1, icon array 60.4; P=.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Visual aids can modestly affect decision confidence and perceptions regarding the benefits of OAC but do not significantly alter decision certainty in a scenario where the guidelines do not recommend for or against OAC. Future work should determine the role of a gauge versus icon array visual for decision-making in stroke prevention in AF."

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used in HFrEF patients with atrial fibrillation, but their role in patients with sinus rhythm is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of OACs in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of seven studies involving 17\u00a0051 patients was conducted. Outcomes included mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization rates.\nRESULTS: OACs significantly reduced non-fatal strokes compared to antiplatelets and placebo. A measurable reduction in nonfatal MIs was observed in most studies. However, no conclusive benefit was found regarding all-cause fatality and rehospitalization rates. The benefit of OACs in stroke prevention was counterbalanced by an increased risk of major bleeding episodes.\nCONCLUSION: OACs may have a role in reducing nonfatal cardiovascular events in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm, particularly those with ischemic etiologies or underlying thrombotic states.

            "abstract": "Patients who had venous thromboembolism (VTE) are not only at increased risk of recurrent VTE but also of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) than the general population. Therefore, the prediction of the risk of these events is important for a tailored prevention and mitigation strategy. We aimed to develop simple scores to estimate recurrent VTE and MACE risks after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in a large cohort of individuals who suffered VTE (EDITH cohort). The primary endpoints were recurrent symptomatic VTE and MACE (composite of non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiovascular death). Arterial thrombotic event (ATE) exclusively was also considered. Independent predictors of main outcomes were derived from multivariable Cox regression models. Weighted integer points based on the effect estimate of identified predictors were used to derive the final risk scores. A total of 1,999 participants (mean age: 54.78 years, 46.4% male, 43.6% unprovoked VTE) were included in the derivation cohort and 10,000 in the validation cohort (built using bootstrapping). During a median post-anticoagulation follow-up of 6.9 years, recurrent VTE occurred in 29.5% of participants and MACE in 14.8%. Independent predictors of recurrent VTE were male sex, age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, and unprovoked VTE (vs. transient risk factor-associated VTE). Independent predictors of MACE were age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The risk of recurrent VTE (moderate vs. low: hazard ratio [HR]: 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06-3.34; high vs. low: HR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.91-4.89), MACE (moderate vs. low: HR: 6.37, 95% CI: 3.19-12.69; high vs. low: HR: 12.32, 95% CI: 6.09-24.89), and ATE (based on MACE-predict risk score) increased gradually from the lowest to highest of the respective prediction risk score groups. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort with overall reasonable models' discrimination performance (recurrent VTE C-statistic: 0.62-0.63, MACE and ATE C-statistic: 0.72-0.77). Contemporary simple risk scores based on readily available clinical characteristics can reasonably predict the risk of recurrent VTE and MACE after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. These findings may influence the choice of anticoagulation strategy after the acute phase of VTE and, therefore, need confirmation by further studies."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dynamic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks is a cornerstone of patient-centered care in atrial fibrillation (AF) management. Unlike traditional approaches that evaluate these risks only at diagnosis or at initiation of oral anticoagulation, current evidence emphasizes periodic reassessment due to the evolving nature of risks.\nAREAS COVERED: Stroke and bleeding risks in AF patients are influenced by aging, new comorbidities, and worsening health conditions, requiring updates to management plans to optimize outcomes. Dynamic increases in CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (or the sex-less CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA) and HAS-BLED scores are associated with heightened risks of stroke and bleeding, underscoring the need for regular reassessment. Addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, renal dysfunction, and concurrent medications is key to improving outcomes. Although several guidelines now recommend risk reassessment at least annually, optimal timing remains unclear. Evidence supports more frequent reassessments for low-risk stroke patients (every 4\u2009months) and high-risk bleeding patients (within 4-6\u2009weeks) to promptly identify changes requiring intervention.\nEXPERT OPINION: Despite its benefits, challenges remain regarding risk reassessment, including the lack of universally applicable intervals and the complexity of multidisciplinary evaluations. Future advancements in artificial intelligence tools are expected to enhance risk reassessment by enabling more precise, personalized, and dynamic patient management."

Moreover, AF has been linked to worse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Real-world data on the impact of AF on outcomes after TAVI remain limited.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of AF on periprocedural and short-term outcomes after TAVI.\nMETHODS: Patients undergoing TAVI at a tertiary center were consecutively included in a prospective registry. Cardiac rhythm at baseline was assessed using 12-lead ECGs. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at 1 year, stroke at 30 days and 1 year, and procedural success, defined as freedom from periprocedural mortality, surgical re-interventions, re-interventions of the aortic valve, major access site complications, and periprocedural bleedings until discharge.\nRESULTS: Among 1655 patients undergoing TAVI, 428 patients (25.6%) had preexisting AF, and 77 patients (4.6%) were diagnosed with new-onset AF during hospitalization for TAVI. AF was not associated with higher mortality at 30 days (3.7% vs 2.0%; P = .054, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-3.4]), but at 1 year (13.8% vs 8.4%; P = .001; aHR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.2-2.2]).

However, the unregulated use of anticoagulants in AF remains a concern, as their efficacy and safety profiles are not yet fully understood.\nMETHODS: Data from AF patients were collected in 2013, 2018, and 2023. First, cross-sectional data on AF patients were gathered during each period to longitudinally evaluate long-term trends in AF characteristics and the progression of anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, predictors of non-regulated dosing of oral anticoagulants (OAC) were analyzed. Second, patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) were prospectively followed for 24 and 60 months with different NOAC doses to assess the risk of clinical outcome events and to analyze independent risk factors for clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 2825 AF patients, with 394 patients undergoing longitudinal follow-up.

At the 60-month follow-up, both all-cause mortality (10.00 vs. 6.49 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.019; 10.00 vs. 6.21 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.005) and the composite endpoint event rate (12.50 vs. 9.61 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.017; 12.50 vs. 9.32 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.013) were significantly higher in the overdosing group compared to standard and underdosing groups. Age and anemia were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality, while renal insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of composite endpoint events.\nCONCLUSION: AF remains a major disease burden, especially in elderly patients. For Asians, NOAC underdosing was still effective in preventing stroke, but its efficacy and safety need to be further validated through larger-scale clinical trials. Meanwhile, overdosing of NOAC should be avoided.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable."

We performed a single center retrospective study including patients with AF on oral anticoagulants admitted to the Emergency Department for IS were included. The primary endpoint was to analyse the severity of stroke evaluated through NIHSS scale according to anticoagulant therapy. The secondary endpoint was 3-month all-cause mortality. A total of 106 AF patients were included, with a mean age of 81.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5 years. Overall, 54.7% were women and 61.3% on DOAC. The AF patients on DOAC were older, with no other clinical differences. Median NIHSS was 12 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 5-19). At multivariable logistic regression analysis DOAC use (compared to warfarin) was associated with lower risk of moderate-severe/severe stroke (NIHSS\u2009\u2265\u200916) (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.355, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.127-0.995). Mechanical thrombectomy was strongly associated with higher severity of stroke (OR 6.113, 95%CI 2.186-17.099). During follow-up, 42 patients died. DOAC use inversely correlated with mortality risk (OR 0.323, 95%CI 0.127-0.822) after adjusting for CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc, time to hospital admission from symptom onset and type of acute treatment. In conclusion, in our contemporary real-world population, patients on DOACs treatment admitted for IS had better outcomes in terms of stroke severity and all-cause mortality compared with patients on VKAs."

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) and malignancy share a complex relationship, significantly complicating patient management. Patients with cancer, particularly those with lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and hematologic malignancies, are at increased risk of AF due to cancer-related hypercoagulability, proinflammatory cytokines, and treatment-related factors. This population faces unique thrombotic and bleeding risks, challenging standard management approaches. Anticoagulation is often complicated by drug-drug interactions with cancer therapies and heightened bleeding risks, including thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) offers an alternative stroke prevention strategy for patients unable to tolerate long-term anticoagulation. By isolating the left atrial appendage, LAAO reduces thromboembolic risk while minimizing bleeding complications. Indications include patients with elevated stroke risk with contraindications to anticoagulation due to nonreversible causes, such as recurrent bleeding or significant drug interactions. Surgical LAAO may also be considered during cardiac surgery in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, with previous studies showing reduced risk of thromboembolic complications. Outcomes of LAAO in cancer patients are generally favorable, with studies showing comparable stroke rates, bleeding risks, and mortality to non-cancer populations. However, malignancy-specific complications, such as device-related thrombus, require further investigation. LAAO provides a promising option for stroke prevention in this complex population, but further research is needed to refine patient selection and optimize outcomes."

The available agents target coagulation factors involved in thrombus formation but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Factor XI plays a minor role in haemostasis but contributes substantially to thrombus expansion, making it an attractive target to mitigate bleeding while maintaining antithrombotic efficacy. Various novel inhibitors, including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, have been developed. Phase II trials in orthopaedic surgery showed dose-dependent reductions in venous thromboembolism without significantly increasing bleeding compared with enoxaparin. In the first phase III trial of a small-molecule inhibitor of activated factor XI in patients with atrial fibrillation, asundexian was associated with a reduction in bleeding but also a higher risk of stroke, compared with apixaban. Factor XI inhibitors appear safe and hold promise for secondary prevention in myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, with ongoing phase III trials assessing their broader efficacy and safety.

A comprehensive search adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted across five databases, identifying eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the last five years. The included studies examined diverse populations, ranging from pediatric to elderly CKD patients, with interventions tailored to specific subgroups, including those with proteinuria or diabetic kidney disease. Key outcomes assessed included changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria reduction, cardiovascular events, and treatment-related adverse effects. Findings highlighted the superiority of ACEis and ARBs in reducing proteinuria and slowing CKD progression, particularly in proteinuric patients, while CCBs were effective in blood pressure control and improving cardiovascular parameters. However, no head-to-head trials directly comparing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (ACEis/ARBs) and CCBs were identified, limiting definitive conclusions regarding their relative efficacy. Limitations such as small sample sizes and short follow-up durations were also noted in some studies.

This review describes how new medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASi), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), can lower heart-kidney risk in people with CKD. GLP1RA are already recommended for managing blood sugar in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes and have been shown to lower the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. GLP1RA will likely soon be included in clinical guidelines, but further research is needed to understand how these medications protect the kidneys. ASi are another new medication that lower the protein found in urine. Larger trials are being done to see how well these medications work in slowing CKD. Lastly, both sGC agonists and ERAs have been shown to relax blood vessels to improve blood flow in the kidney, and reduce the amount of protein found in urine, both of which are critical to protecting kidneys. Larger clinical trials are being done to see if these medications prevent CKD from getting worse. In summary, this review describes the new and promising treatments for CKD. These therapies hold the potential to slow kidney disease and improve the wellbeing of patients. Further research of these new treatments is important for improving CKD care.\nABSTRACT: Despite recent advancements in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), identifying novel therapies beyond guideline-directed therapies that reduce residual cardiorenal risk remains imperative. In this review, we highlight the clinical evidence supporting emerging therapies for CKD, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and other incretin-based therapies, aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASI), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) agonists and anti-inflammatory drugs. Long-acting GLP1RA are already recommended for glycemic control in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes and the large, dedicated kidney outcome trial FLOW was recently stopped early for efficacy. Emerging clinical trial evidence supports the concept that ASI also provide additional benefit on top of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which remain a cornerstone of CKD treatment. Next, we consider the use of sGC agonists, which target nitric oxide bioavailability and thereby reduce albuminuria. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential of ERA, which act through hemodynamic and anti-fibrotic mechanisms, thereby addressing a common final pathway in the development of CKD. Accordingly, our review highlights the changing therapeutic landscape for CKD with promising agents to further prevent the progression of kidney disease."

The primary endpoint was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels after 6 months.\nRESULTS: This study included a total of 364 patients with DKD, 153 (42.0%) of whom were female. The median disease duration was 8.0 years, and the mean values of age, HbA1c level, body mass index, and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were 52.1 years, 8.6%, 27.8 kg/m2, and 88.0 mg/g, respectively.

Furthermore, one or two out of three adult Americans exhibit metabolic syndrome or an insulin-resistant state, depending on their age group.\nSUMMARY: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a complication often associated with type II diabetes or the insulin-resistant condition, typically identifiable through proteinuria. Proteinuria serves as both a marker and a contributing factor to kidney damage, and it significantly heightens the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, including atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in lowering blood pressure, reducing proteinuria, and slowing CKD progression. However, hyperkalemia is a common and serious adverse effect associated with using RAASi.\nKEY MESSAGES: It is imperative to establish personalized management strategies to enable patients to continue RAASi therapy while effectively addressing hyperkalemia risk. Healthcare professionals must be careful not to inadvertently create a low renal perfusion state, which can reduce distal nephron luminal flow or luminal sodium concentration while using RAASi. Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs), such as finerenone, are demonstrated to delay CKD progression and reduce CV complications, all while mitigating the risk of hyperkalemia. Additionally, maintaining a routine monitoring regimen for serum potassium levels among at-risk patients, making dietary adjustments, and considering the adoption of newer potassium-binding agents hold promise for optimizing RAASi therapy and achieving more effective hyperkalemia management."

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are drugs with known antihypertensive effects as well as CV and kidney protective effects in patients with CKD. Studies have shown that adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to ACEI or ARB therapy has additive benefits in terms of kidney and CV protection in patients with CKD (with/without T2DM). For patients with CKD associated with T2DM who have persistent albuminuria despite taking the maximum tolerated dose of a RAASi, adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) has demonstrated CV and kidney benefits in clinical trials. In this article, we review the use of ACEIs and ARBs for their kidney and CV protective effects when used alone or in combination with a drug with a different mechanism of action. From reviewing the available evidence, it seems clear that a multimodal drug effort is needed to achieve maximum kidney and CV protective effects for patients with CKD associated with T2DM."

            "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of CKD and ESKD in the United States and worldwide. Pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications for glycemia, dyslipidemia, and BP control have shown success in slowing the progression of DKD. Traditional treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and more recently the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as finerenone, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, have led to added benefits on various outcomes. However, significant residual risk for DKD progression remains despite the current standard-of-care approaches. Arteriolar hyalinosis (AH) is among the key findings seen on kidney biopsies of patients with DKD. It results from the excessive accumulation of hyaluronan (HA) in the arterioles. AH has not been targeted specifically by any of the therapeutic methods currently being used. We discuss in this manuscript the potential use of a selective therapy targeting AH and the increased total renal HA deposits using a HA synthesis inhibitor in DKD."

It is assumed that CKD will become the 5th most common cause of death worldwide in 2040. CKD is associated with high risk of mortality, morbidity, related in particular to cardiovascular disease, as well as high healthcare costs. Clinical strategies to manage CKD should encompass extensive life-style modification including weight normalization, reduction of dietary protein and salt intakes, regular exercise and avoidance of nicotine. Pharmacologically it includes inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sodium-glucose co-transporter\u20112 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in both diabetes-related and non-diabetic CKD and strategies to control other risk factors such as proteinuria, hyperglycemia and lipid disturbances. Among the various measures aimed at slowing CKD progression, blood pressure control and in particular RAAS inhibitors have received the most attention. Another therapeutic option includes aldosterone inhibition, be it via classical aldosterone-antagonists or the new mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Avoidance of nephrotoxic agents (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) seems self-explanatory. Overall, given the often asymptomatic course of CKD in particular in early phases, patient education and self-empowerment as well as treatment in a\u00a0multidisciplinary team appear essential to stem the tide of patients with advanced kidney damage."

The progression can be significantly slowed by blocking the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). Another new option to enhance the effect of blocking the RAAS system is the use of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, or gliflozins. Dapagliflozin is currently available and reimbursed for patients with both diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease.

The pathogenic processes in these circumstances have been documented to be significantly influenced by\u00a0enhanced renin-angiotensin system activity. The current meta-analysis was carried out to assess the efficacy of direct renin inhibitors in preventing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. This meta-analysis was conducted as per the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched the relevant medical literature through PubMed, Cochrane library and EMBASE. The primary efficacy outcome was a percentage change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) (in mg/g) level. Other primary efficacy outcomes included remission from microalbuminuria to normal albuminuria and progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria. Four randomized control studies were identified and included in the current meta-analysis involving 9,609 participants. The use of direct renin inhibitors was superior in reducing mean UACR compared to angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The pooled mean difference in UACR between direct renin inhibitors and the control group was 9.42% (95% CI: -15.70 to -3.15: p-value=0.003). The odds of progression from microalbuminuria to normal albuminuria are 1.26 times higher in patients receiving direct renin inhibitors compared to\u00a0patients in the control group (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46, p-value=0.002).

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have become a preferred treatment for type II diabetic patients since they have cardiorenal protective effects. However, most elderly diabetic patients also have hypertension, and the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have not been studied in hypertensive diabetic patients or animal models. The present study examined if controlling hyperglycemia with empagliflozin, or given in combination with lisinopril, slows the progression of renal injury in hypertensive diabetic rats. Studies were performed using hypertensive streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic Dahl salt-sensitive (STZ-SS) rats and in deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertensive type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) rats. Administration of empagliflozin alone or in combination with lisinopril reduced blood glucose, proteinuria, glomerular injury, and renal fibrosis in STZ-SS rats without altering renal blood flow (RBF) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Blood pressure and renal hypertrophy were also reduced in rats treated with empagliflozin and lisinopril. Administration of empagliflozin alone or in combination with lisinopril lowered blood glucose, glomerulosclerosis, and renal fibrosis but had no effect on blood pressure, kidney weight, or proteinuria in hypertensive T2DN rats. RBF was not altered in any of the treatment groups, and GFR was elevated in empagliflozin-treated hypertensive T2DN rats. These results indicate that empagliflozin is highly effective in controlling blood glucose levels and slows the progression of renal injury in both hypertensive type 1 and type 2 diabetic rats, especially when given in combination with lisinopril to lower blood pressure."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. No specific treatment of the underlying condition is available for the majority of patients, but ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I) and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARB) slows progression in albuminuric CKD. Adding a mineralocorticoid receptor-antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone has an additive effect. However, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockade increases the risk of hyperkalaemia which is exacerbated by the presence of CKD. Thus, hyperkalaemia may prevent optimal use of RAAS-blockade in some patients.This project hypothesises that adding a potassium binder (patiromer) allows for improved RAAS-blockade including the use of MRA, thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment is limited by hyperkalaemia.If successful, the study may lead to improved treatment of this subgroup of patients with CKD. Furthermore, the study will examine the feasibility of potassium binders in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: An open-label, randomised controlled trial including 140 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25-60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2, a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) &gt;500\u2009mg/g (or 200\u2009mg/g if diabetes mellitus) and a current or two previous plasma-potassium &gt;4.5\u2009mmol/L. Patients who develop hyperkaliaemia &gt;5.5\u2009mmol/L during a run-in phase, in which RAAS-blockade is intesified with the possible addition of spironolactone, are randomised to 12-month treatment with maximal tolerated ACE-I/ARB and spironolactone with or without patiromer.The primary endpoint is the difference in UACR measured at randomisation and 12 months compared between the two groups. Secondary endpoints include CKD progression, episodes of hyperkalaemia, blood pressure, eGFR, markers of cardiovascular disease, diet and quality of life.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by The Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics (REFNO 1-10-72-110-20) and is registered in the EudraCT database (REFNO 2020-001595-15).

            "abstract": "There is currently an unmet need for effective treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that slows disease progression, prevents development of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, and prolongs survival of patients with CKD. In the last 20\u00a0years, the only agents to show a reduction in the risk of CKD progression in patients with and without type\u00a02 diabetes (T2D) were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, but neither drug class has provided a decreased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and evidence for their use in patients with CKD without T2D is relatively limited. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying the progression of CKD, its associated risk factors, and summarizes the potential therapeutic approaches for managing CKD. There is increasing evidence to support the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter\u00a02 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy in patients with CKD, including data from the designated kidney outcome trials in patients with T2D (CREDENCE) and in patients with or without T2D (DAPA-CKD). These studies showed a significant reduction in the risk of CKD progression with canagliflozin (in patients with T2D) or dapagliflozin (in patients with or without T2D), respectively, with DAPA-CKD being the first trial to show a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. On the basis of these data, individualized treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with diabetic and nondiabetic CKD to slow disease progression."

Despite the introduction of these therapeutics, an important residual risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular death remains in patients with T2D. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are a promising therapeutic option in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) owing to the reported effects of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in inflammatory cells, podocytes, fibroblasts, mesangial cells and vascular cells. In preclinical studies, MRAs consistently reduce albuminuria, CKD progression, and activation of fibrotic and inflammatory pathways. DKD clinical studies have similarly demonstrated that steroidal MRAs lead to albuminuria reduction compared with placebo, although hyperkalaemia is a major secondary effect. Non-steroidal MRAs carry a lower risk of hyperkalaemia than steroidal MRAs, and the large FIDELIO-DKD clinical trial showed that the non-steroidal MRA finerenone also slowed CKD progression and reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo in patients with T2D. Encouragingly, other non-steroidal MRAs have anti-albuminuric properties in DKD. Whether or not combining MRAs with other renoprotective drugs such as SGLT2 inhibitors might provide additive protective effects warrants further investigation."

While angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are, without a doubt, safe and effective drugs, a significant proportion of patients with CKD still progress to end-stage kidney disease. After decades of negative trials, nephrologists have finally found cause for optimism with the introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). Recent trials such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CREDENCE have provided evidence of the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, which have now found widespread acceptance as first-line agents for diabetic CKD, in addition to ACEi/ARBs. Considering results from the DAPA-CKD study, it is expected that their use will soon be expanded to other causes of albuminuric CKD as well, although confirmation from further trials, such as the EMPA-KIDNEY study is awaited. Likewise, although the role of mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation in CKD progression has been known for decades, it is only now with the FIDELIO-DKD study that we have evidence of benefits of MRAs on hard renal endpoints, specifically in patients with diabetic CKD. While further research is ongoing, given the evidence of synergism between the three drug classes, it is foreseeable that a combination of two or more of these drugs may soon become the standard of care for CKD, regardless of underlying aetiology.

Resection for disseminations of PDAC is not recommended.\nCASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 69-year-old woman with a pancreatic tumor that was detected with computed tomography (CT) during a postoperative colon cancer checkup. She was suspected of having pancreatic body cancer without distant metastasis. Distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection was performed. Postoperative pathological examination revealed an invasive ductal adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis (pT4N1M0, stage III). Postoperatively, she received adjuvant chemotherapy containing gemcitabine and S-1 for 1 year and 4 months, and S-1 monotherapy for 1 year. Six years and 2 months after the initial surgery, her serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level elevated, and CT revealed soft tissue in front of the left kidney. Positron emission tomography/CT also revealed high fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the tissue. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with dissemination of PDAC. The patient was administered chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1. One year and 6 months after the diagnosis of dissemination, CT revealed reduction of the nodule. Therefore, we decided to eliminate this dissemination. A left nephrectomy and partial gastrectomy were performed. Histopathological examination confirmed dissemination of PDAC. The patient refused adjuvant chemotherapy. No evidence of recurrence has been observed for 13 years and 3 months since the initial surgery, and 5 years and 1 month since the resection of the dissemination.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case showed a recurrence of dissemination after radical PDAC surgery, and the patient showed long-term survival without recurrence after dissemination resection. Resection of dissemination may confer long-term survival in selected patients."

Here, we analyzed the prognostic value of the two biomarkers in patients who participated in the randomized phase III IDEA-France and HORG trials.\nMETHODS: Plasma samples were collected after surgery and before adjuvant chemotherapy. ctDNA analysis was performed using a clinically validated, personalized, tumor-informed 16-plex protein chain reaction assay. Multivariable analyses for time to recurrence (TTR; patients without recurrence or death due to CC) and overall survival (OS) were performed using ctDNA and IS results, along with other parameters including treatment duration and disease risk group.\nRESULTS: Of the 554 patients with available ctDNA results, 445 were ctDNA-negative (80.3%) and 109 were ctDNA-positive (19.7%); baseline characteristics showed more T4/N2 and venous embolism/lymphatic invasion/perineural invasion+ in ctDNA-positive patients. With a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the 2-year TTR rate was 43.5% (95% CI, 34.1 to 52.6) for ctDNA-positive patients and 88.1% (95% CI, 84.7 to 90.8) for ctDNA-negative patients (P &lt; .0001). ctDNA was confirmed as an independent prognostic marker for both TTR (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR], 5.21 [95% CI, 3.59 to 7.58]; P &lt; .001) and OS (adjHR, 4.84 [95% CI, 3.40 to 6.89]; P &lt; .001). ctDNA remained the most significant prognostic factor irrespective of disease stage, treatment duration, and IS results. IS was not prognostic in ctDNA-positive patients but remained a significant prognostic tool for ctDNA-negative patients.\nCONCLUSION: In this combined analysis of two adjuvant trials dedicated to patients with stage III CC after surgery, ctDNA was detectable in 19.7% of the patients and was confirmed as a major independent prognostic biomarker. IS seems to bring additional prognostic information in the 80.3% of patients who are ctDNA-negative."

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aspirin in the secondary prevention of colorectal cancer.\nMETHODS: This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 66 centres across 11 countries and territories (ten in Asia-Pacific; one in the Middle East). The trial included patients aged 18 years and older with Dukes' C or high-risk Dukes' B colon cancer or Dukes' B or C rectal cancer who had undergone resection and had completed standard adjuvant therapy (at least 3 months of chemotherapy). Patients with contraindications to aspirin, familial syndromes of colorectal cancer, recent other cancers, and clinically significant history of cardiovascular disease or stroke were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to aspirin 200 mg daily or placebo for 3 years, and were followed up for 5 years. Randomisation was stratified by study centre, tumour site and stage, and inclusion of oxaliplatin in adjuvant chemotherapy. The patients, study team, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignment.

Median follow-up at data cutoff was 59\u00b72 months (IQR 36\u00b77-60\u00b70). 5-year disease-free survival was 77\u00b70% (95% CI 73\u00b76-80\u00b70) in the aspirin group and 74\u00b78% (71\u00b73-77\u00b79) in the placebo group (hazard ratio of 0\u00b791 [95% CI 0\u00b773-1\u00b713]; p=0\u00b738). Any-grade adverse events were reported in 390 (49%) of 791 patients in the aspirin group versus 386 (51%) of 759 in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 95 (12%) patients in the aspirin group versus 107 (14%) in the placebo group. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.

After patients were divided into AC and non-AC groups, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to match the two groups.\nRESULTS: After PSM, 84 patients were included in each group. There were no significant differences between the AC and non-AC groups in the 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS; 88.01% vs. 81.46%, p\u2009=\u20090.295) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS; 69.57 vs. 70.08%, p\u2009=\u20090.820), respectively. In the subgroup analysis, AC improved both the CSS [hazard ratio (HR)0.273; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.094-0.797, p\u2009=\u20090.017] and RFS (HR 0.376; 95% CI 0.174-0.806, p\u2009=\u20090.012) only for tumors with N2 disease compared to non-AC.\nCONCLUSION: The current indications for AC in patients with CC after D3 lymphadenectomy should be reconsidered. It is possible that AC is appropriate only for stage III CC patients with N2 disease."

            "abstract": "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a powerful measure of minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Although immunotherapy has been widely established in metastatic CRC that is mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H), its role in non-metastatic CRC is rapidly evolving. In resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage II CRC, adjuvant fluoropyrimidine has no benefit and is not recommended. There is growing evidence to suggest diminished benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation in localized CRC that is dMMR/MSI-H. We present two cases of dMMR/MSI-H stage III CRC treated with definitive surgery wherein adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy led to a failure to clear postoperative plasma ctDNA levels, prompting a change to immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab and resultant ctDNA clearance. We illustrate that chemotherapy may achieve suboptimal disease control in localized colon cancer that is dMMR/MSI-H, while plasma ctDNA offers a window of opportunity to gauge the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy to clear microscopic disease in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer. These findings are important to contextualize given that relapse is inevitable with failure to clear MRD in the postoperative stage I-III CRC setting whereby chemotherapy remains the standard adjuvant therapy in resected, dMMR/MSI-H stage III colon cancer."

There are no reports of the procedure for tumors fed by middle colic vessels because it is a difficult procedure. We evaluated the feasibility and oncological outcomes of the procedure in elderly patients.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 336 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with D3 resection for Stage I-III ascending and transverse colon cancer between 2010 and 2021. Patients were divided into the EP (age\u2009\u2265\u200975 years) and nEP (age\u2009<\u200975 years) groups, and short- and long-term outcomes were analyzed using propensity score matching.\nRESULTS: The median follow-up period was 60.7 months. After matching, we enrolled 129 patients. The surgery time, estimated blood loss, postoperative complication rate, number of harvested lymph nodes, and recurrence rate did not differ significantly between the groups; however, the adjuvant chemotherapy rate was significantly lower in the EP group. The EP group had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (p\u2009<\u20090.01) than the nEP group; however, the cancer-specific (p\u2009=\u20090.15) and recurrence-free (p\u2009=\u20090.36) survivals did not differ significantly from those in the nEP group.

The associations between TME grade, adjuvant therapy receipt, and oncologic outcomes have not been well-studied. We aimed to determine the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and oncologic outcomes in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) or short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by proctectomy and to evaluate this association stratified by TME grade.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a retrospective multi-institutional cohort of primary LARC patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2018 who received neoadjuvant CRT/SCRT followed by proctectomy. Complete TME was defined as complete mesorectal excision, and noncomplete TME was defined as near-complete or incomplete TME. We used adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to test the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and mortality or locoregional recurrence (LRR) across groups.\nRESULTS: We identified 746 eligible patients. On final pathology, 101 (13.5%) had noncomplete and 645 (86.5%) had complete TME. Rates of adjuvant chemotherapy receipt were similar between noncomplete and complete TME groups (70.3% and 69.5%, respectively). Mean follow-up interval was 35\u00a0mo. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); the same association existed when stratifying patients by TME grade. For patients with a complete TME, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with lower LRR (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The LRR model for the noncomplete TME group did not converge due to few captured recurrences.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data show an association between adjuvant chemotherapy and positive outcomes in LARC patients receiving neoadjuvant CRT/SCRT followed by proctectomy."

Data from the FOxTROT clinical trial showed potential benefit of a 6-wk neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in T3/T4 patients. The present study evaluated real-world outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy in a national cohort of patients with resectable colon cancer.\nMETHODS: 169,120 patients with clinical stage I, II, or III colon cancer from the National Cancer Database registry were included. Patients were categorized as having received neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NACT), surgery then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), or surgery alone. Factors associated with treatment sequencing and outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: Of identified patients, 1.4% received NACT including 0.5% of stage I, 1.8% of stage II, and 3.0% of stage III. For stage I, 5-y overall survival (OS) was 74.7% after AC, 62.2% after NACT, and 76.4% after SA. For stage II, 5-y OS was 73.2% after AC, 66.8% after NACT, and 64.3% after SA.

Several phase II and III trials suggest a promising future role of immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, especially in MSI-H localized gastric adenocarcinomas.\u00a0We present a 38-year-old man diagnosed in March 2022 with poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma\u00a0clinical stage III (cT4 N0 M0) with deficiency of MLH1 and PMS2, combined positive score (CPS) of 100 and negative HER2 immunohistochemistry, had poor tumor response to preoperative 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT). It was considered unresectable because of the involvement of the colon, mesocolon, duodenum, pancreas,\u00a0and retroperitoneum. Then, first-line systemic treatment with 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)-nivolumab was initiated in August 2022, with a significant radiologic tumor reduction after six cycles, allowing a curative surgery in March 2023 with complete pathologic tumor response, followed by capecitabine and nivolumab for one year, maintaining radiological\u00a0remission in the last follow-up in April 2024.

This study investigates the real-world impact of the guideline change on overall survival (OS) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\nMETHODS: Patients with high-risk stage II (pT4\u00a0+) and III (pN+) colon cancer were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, based on surgical resection and adjuvant CAPOX before (2015-2016) versus after (2018-2019) the guideline change. Both groups were compared on OS, using multivariable Cox regression, and on PROs.\nRESULTS: Patients treated before (n\u00a0=\u00a02330) and after (n\u00a0=\u00a02108) the guideline change showed similar OS (HR 1.02; 95\u00a0%CI [0.89-1.16]), also in high-risk stage III (pT4/N2, HR 1.06 [0.89-1.26]).

            "abstract": "Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported. Observational studies have associated aspirin or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor usage either before or after colorectal cancer diagnosis with lower risk of recurrence and suggest that PIK3CA mutational status is predictive of better response to COX-2 inhibition. To prospectively test whether adding the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib to standard adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence and improves survival, the National Cancer Institute sponsored the CALGB/SWOG 80702 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01150045) for patients with stage III resected colon cancer. Although the primary hypothesis for all patients did not show a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) with celecoxib, subgroup analysis by PIK3CA mutational status was a preplanned study. PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations were detected in 259 of 1,197 tumors with available whole-exome sequencing data. When stratified by PIK3CA status, patients with PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations treated with celecoxib exhibited improved DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.96]) compared with PIK3CA wildtype patients (adjusted HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.14]), although the interaction test was nonsignificant (P<sub>interaction</sub> = .13). Overall survival was similarly improved for patients with PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations (adjusted HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.85]) compared with PIK3CA wildtype patients (adjusted HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.30]; P<sub>interaction</sub> = .04). Although the test for heterogeneity in DFS did not reach statistical significance, the results suggest potential utility of PIK3CA to consider selective usage of COX-2 inhibitors in addition to standard treatment for stage III colon cancer."

An immune scoring system, Immunoscore (IS), based on tumor-infiltrating T cells in stage I-III CRC, was used to predict prognosis. An alternative immune scoring signature of immune activation (SIA) reflects the balance between anti- and pro-tumoral immune components. The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of modified IS (mIS) and modified SIA (mSIA) in locally advanced pathological T4 (pT4) CRC, including stage IV CRC. Immunohistochemical staining for immune cell markers, such as CD3 (pan-T cell marker), CD8 (anti-tumoral cytotoxic T cell marker) and CD163 (tumor-supportive macrophage marker), in specimens from patients with radically resected pT4 CRC at stages II-IV was performed. mIS levels in the T4 CRC cohort were not associated with prognosis. However, low mSIA levels were associated with low survival. Furthermore, low mSIA was an independent predictor of recurrence in patients with radically resected pT4 CRC. In patients with CRC who did not receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, low mSIA was a major poor prognostic factor; however, this was not observed in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Evaluation of the tumor-infiltrating immune cell population could serve as a valuable marker of recurrence and poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced CRC. mSIA assessment after radical CRC resection may be promising for identifying high-risk patients with pT4 CRC who require aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy."

Summary data were extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves using DigitizeIT. Absolute differences in RFS event rates were compared at matched intervals using multiple paired t-tests.\nRESULTS: The initial search yielded 1469 manuscripts. After screening, 18 RCTs were eligible (14 Stage II/III; 4 Stage IV), inclusive of 16,682 patients. In the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy, the greatest rate of recurrence was observed in the first year (mean RFS event rate; 0-0.5\u2009years: 0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21; 0.5-1\u2009years: 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09).

In Stage IV trials, RFS event rates significantly differed for the interval 0-0.5\u2009years (p\u2009=\u20090.012), corresponding with adjuvant treatment durations of 6\u2009months. In Stage II/III trials, which included therapies of 6-24\u2009months duration, there were marked differences in the RFS event rates between surgery and chemotherapy arms for the intervals 0-0.5\u2009years (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 0.5-1\u2009years (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with smaller differences in the RFS event rates for the intervals 1-2\u2009years (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and 2-3\u2009years (p\u2009=\u20090.010).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review of positive RCTs comparing adjuvant chemotherapy to surgery alone for Stage II-IV CRC, observed RFS improvements were driven by early divergences that occurred primarily during active cytotoxic chemotherapy. Late recurrence dynamics were not influenced by adjuvant therapy use. Such observations may have implications for the use of chemotherapy for micrometastatic clones detectable by cell-free DNA-based methodologies."

Following risk adjustment, Delayed resection was associated with similar 1-year [hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.04, P\u2009=\u20090.72], but inferior 5- (HR 1.24, CI 1.22-1.26; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 10-year survival (HR 1.22, CI 1.20-1.23; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Black race [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.36, CI 1.31-1.41; P\u2009<\u20090.001], Medicaid insurance coverage (AOR 1.34, CI 1.26-1.42; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and care at high-volume hospitals (AOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.08-1.17; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were linked with greater likelihood of Delayed resection.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with CC who underwent resection\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0days following diagnosis demonstrated similar 1-year, but inferior 5- and 10-year survival, compared to those who underwent surgery within 25\u00a0days. Socioeconomic factors, including race and Medicaid insurance, were linked with greater odds of delayed resection. Efforts to balance appropriate preoperative evaluation with expedited resection are needed to optimize patient outcomes."

This study assessed the survival benefits of adjuvant therapy after curative resection of stage II-III colonic SRCC.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of outcomes of adjuvant therapy in colonic SRCC using National Cancer Database (2010-2019) data. Patients who received adjuvant therapy were matched to those who did not use the nearest neighbor propensity-score matching. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS).\nRESULTS: The unmatched cohort included 3530 patients. Patients who received adjuvant therapy were significantly younger, more often male, and more often had Charlson scores 0-1, left-sided cancers, stage III disease, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion. The matched cohort included 958 patients (53.6% female); 479 received adjuvant therapy and 479 did not. Adjuvant therapy was associated with longer mean OS (39.9 vs. 29.2 months; P < .001). Survival benefit of adjuvant therapy was evident in stage III disease (37.5 vs. 24.7 months; P < .001), right-sided colon cancer (40.2 vs. 27.7 months; P < .001), and transverse colon cancer (40.6 vs. 31.1 months; P = .002), but not stage II disease (52.1 vs. 53.1 months; P = .694) or left-sided colon cancer (35.8 vs. 32.6 months; P = .417). Independent predictors of improved OS were adjuvant therapy (HR: 0.539; P < .001), laparoscopic surgery (HR: 0.829; P = .001), robotic-assisted surgery (HR: 0.63; P = .007), and number of harvested lymph nodes (HR: 0.976; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant therapy was associated with improved OS in stage III, right-sided, and transverse colon SRCC. The survival benefit of adjuvant therapy in stage II and left-sided colon SRCC was limited."

The food effect (FE) part of the study was a randomised, 2-cycle, 2-way crossover design, which enrolled 16 participants to receive a single oral dose of 80 mg ZX-7101A tablets.\nRESULTS: ZX-7101A tablets were safe and well-tolerated in both SAD and FE studies. No participant died or experienced SAE, or withdrew prematurely. The prodrug ZX-7101A was rapidly transformed into the active ingredient ZX-7101 after a single oral dose of 40-320 mg. The blood concentration of ZX-7101A was below the lower limit of quantification at most time points. ZX-7101 reached peak concentration about 3-4 h postdose in all dose cohorts. The elimination half-life of ZX-7101 was 83.01-125.55 h, and AUC<sub>0-24</sub> was 1655.4-11483.7 h*ng/mL. The FE part showed that the high-fat meal significantly affected the exposure parameters compared to the fasted condition. The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-t</sub> of ZX-7101 under the fasted condition were 1.73 and 1.78 times those under the fed condition, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: A single oral dose of 40 mg and 80 mg ZX-7101A tablets achieved sufficient ZX-7101 exposure for effectively inhibiting influenza A and B viruses and avian influenza viruses. These findings support 40 mg and 80 mg of ZX-7101A tablets as single dose regimens for use in phase II/III clinical trials.

            "abstract": "Children's and adults' rhinosinusitis are two diseases that have both similarities and differences in anatomy, epidemiology, causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. At the same rhinosinusitis is one of the most common in otorhinolaryngology's practice, both in children and adults. The of adults paranasal sinuses (PNS) anatomy differs from children's PNS anatomy. Although ostiomeatal complex occlusion is recognized as a major cause of poor ventilation and drainage of the adult paranasal sinuses, it does not have a strong effect on pediatric rhinosinusitis, but adenoids play a key role. Adenoids are bacteria and biofilms reservoirs that cause chronic refractory rhinosinusitis regardless of pharyngeal tonsil size. The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is lower in children than in adults. Diagnosis of children's rhinosinusitis is more difficult because nasal cavity endoscopic examination is performed rarely due to the occasional need of general anesthesia during the procedure. Moreover, it's necessary to take into account prevailing etiological role of viruses in ARS at children's age and chronic adenoiditis often accompanies pediatric CRS, which requires attention prescribing medical therapy as the basis of rhinosinusitis treatment. The DysheLORz based on Pelargonium sidoides roots is highly effective and safe for children's and adults ARS and CRS treatment, both as monotherapy and in combination with topical steroids and antibiotics. This herbal medicine immunomodulatory effect is mediated mainly by stimulating the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3. It activates macrophages and improves their phagocytic activity. IL-12, together with TNF-\u03b1, enhances NK and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes' activity against infected cells. IL-12 effect on Th1 lymphocytes maturation provides a link between innate and adaptive immunity. This is also increasing MCP-1, IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b2 chemokines synthesis and decreasing MIP-1\u03b1, ENA-78, GRO\u03b1 and IL-8 production in PNS and nasal mucosa. This leads to decrease of neutrophils chemotaxis to the inflammation site, and decline of serine proteases concentration (neutrophils main enzymes), that increases mucous membrane epithelial barrier permeability, reducing bacterial infections risk. Additionally, Pelargonium sidoides increases epithelial cells beating cilia frequency and inhibits hemagglutinin and neuraminidase present on influenza virus surface. The drug increases antimicrobial peptides production as defensins, human neutrophil peptides (HNP) and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which is also important for rapid inflammation regression in rhinosinusitis. It causes bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells inhibition, phagocytosis stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) release and oxidative burst. The medicine had a direct effect on Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenza. Based on these data, it is possible to explain the high effectiveness and safety of the drugs based on Pelargonium sidoides in ENT organs inflammation treatment, for both adults and children over 1 year old."

            "abstract": "Microbiota-derived desaminotyrosine (DAT) protects the host from influenza by modulating the type I interferon (IFN) response. The aim of this study was to investigate the antivirus effects of a DAT-producing bacteria strain. A comparative genomics analysis and UHPLC Q-Exactive MS were used to search for potential strains and confirm their ability to produce DAT, respectively. The anti-influenza functions of the DAT producer were evaluated using an antibiotic-treated mouse model by orally administering the specific strain before viral infection. The results showed the Lactiplantibacillus pentosus CCFM1227 contained the phy gene and produced DAT by degrading phloretin. In vivo, L. pentosus CCFM1227 re-inoculation increased the DAT level in feces, and protected from influenza through inhibiting viral replication and alleviating lung immunopathology. Furthermore, CCFM1227-derived DAT was positively correlated with the IFN-\u03b2 level in the lung. The transcriptome results showed that CCFM1227 activated gene expression in the context of the defense response to the virus, and the response to interferon-beta. Moreover, CCFM1227 treatment upregulated the expression of MHC-I family genes, which regulate the adaptive immune response. In conclusion, L. pentosus CCFM1227 exerted antiviral effects by producing DAT in the gut, and this may provide a potential solution for creating effective antiviral probiotics."

Anti-infective agents were considered according to their pharmacological group and potential harmful risk using the Australian and Swedish classification systems. Prevalence rate was estimated annually and by trimester. Average annual percent change (AAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Joinpoint regression.\nRESULTS: Among 7\u2009571\u2009035 pregnancies, 3\u2009027\u2009031 (40.0%) received \u22651 antibacterial. This proportion decreased significantly from 41.5% in 2010 to 36.1% in 2019 (AAPC\u2009=\u2009-1.7%, [95%CI, -2.5 to -1.0%]). Conversely, use of antiviral agents increased during the 10-year study period for anti-herpes simplex virus agents (AAPC\u2009=\u00a04.4%, [3.7-5.2%]), influenza agents (AAPC\u2009=\u200925.4%, [6.2-48.1%]) and for HIV-antiretroviral agents (AAPC\u2009=\u00a01.3%, [0.6-2.0%]).

            "abstract": "Biofilms are complex structures formed by bacteria, fungi, or even viruses on biotic and abiotic surfaces, and they can be found in almost any part of the human body. The prevalence of biofilm-associated diseases has increased in recent years, mainly because of the frequent use of indwelling medical devices that create opportunities for clinically important bacteria and fungi to form biofilms either on the device or on the neighboring tissues. As a result of their resistance to antibiotics and host immunity factors, biofilms have been associated with the development or persistence of several clinically important diseases. The inability to completely eradicate biofilms drastically increases the burden of disease on both the patient and the healthcare system. Therefore, it is crucial to develop innovative ways to tackle the growth and development of biofilms. This review focuses on dental- and implant-associated biofilm infections, their prevalence in humans, and potential therapeutic intervention strategies, including the recent advances in pharmacology and biomedical engineering. It lists current strategies used to control the formation of clinically important biofilms, including novel antibiotics and their carriers, antiseptics and disinfectants, small molecule anti-biofilm agents, surface treatment strategies, and nanostructure functionalization, as well as multifunctional coatings particularly suitable for providing antibacterial effects to the surface of implants, to treat either dental- or implant-related bacterial infections."

            "abstract": "Venetian quarantine 400\u00a0years ago was an important public health measure. Since 1900 this has been refined to include \"challenge\" or deliberate infection with pathogens be they viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Our focus is virology and ranges from the early experiments in Cuba with Yellow Fever Virus to the most widespread pathogen of our current times, COVID-19. The latter has so far caused over four million deaths worldwide and 190 million cases of the disease. Quarantine and challenge were also used to investigate the Spanish Influenza of 1918 which caused over 100 million deaths. We consider here the merits of the approach, that is the speeding up of knowledge in a practical sense leading to the more rapid licensing of vaccines and antimicrobials. At the core of quarantine and challenge initiatives is the design of the unit to allow safe confinement of the pathogen and protection of the staff. Most important though is the safety of volunteers. We can see now, as in 1900, that members of our society are prepared and willing to engage in these experiments for the public good. Our ethnology study, where the investigator observed the experiment from within the quarantine, gave us the first indication of changing attitudes amongst volunteers whilst in quarantine. These quarantine experiments, referred to as challenge studies, human infection studies, or \"controlled human infection models\" involve thousands of clinical samples taken over two to three weeks and can provide a wealth of immunological and molecular data on the infection itself and could allow the discovery of new targets for vaccines and therapeutics. The Yellow Fever studies from 121\u00a0years ago gave the impetus for development of a successful vaccine still used today whilst also uncovering the nature of the Yellow Fever agent, namely that it was a virus. We outline how carefully these experiments are approached and the necessity to have high quality units with self-contained air-flow along with extensive personal protective equipment for nursing and medical staff. Most important is the employment of highly trained scientific, medical and nursing staff. We face a future of emerging pathogens driven by the increasing global population, deforestation, climate change, antibiotic resistance and increased global travel. These emerging pathogens may be pathogens we currently are not aware of or have not caused outbreaks historically but could also be mutated forms of known pathogens including viruses such as influenza (H7N9, H5N1 etc.) and coronaviruses. This calls for challenge studies to be part of future pandemic preparedness as an additional tool to assist with the rapid development of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, immunomodulators and new vaccines."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous Mycobacterium infections, particularly Mycobacterium abscessus, are increasingly common among patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchiectatic lung diseases. Treatment is challenging due to intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage therapy represents a potentially novel approach. Relatively few active lytic phages are available and there is great variation in phage susceptibilities among M. abscessus isolates, requiring personalized phage identification.\nMETHODS: Mycobacterium isolates from 200 culture-positive patients with symptomatic disease were screened for phage susceptibilities. One or more lytic phages were identified for 55 isolates. Phages were administered intravenously, by aerosolization, or both to 20 patients on a compassionate use basis and patients were monitored for adverse reactions, clinical and microbiologic responses, the emergence of phage resistance, and phage neutralization in serum, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\nRESULTS: No adverse reactions attributed to therapy were seen in any patient regardless of the pathogen, phages administered, or the route of delivery. Favorable clinical or microbiological responses were observed in 11 patients. Neutralizing antibodies were identified in serum after initiation of phage delivery intravenously in 8 patients, potentially contributing to lack of treatment response in 4 cases, but were not consistently associated with unfavorable responses in others. Eleven patients were treated with only a single phage, and no phage resistance was observed in any of these.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phage treatment of Mycobacterium infections is challenging due to the limited repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, but favorable clinical outcomes in patients lacking any other treatment options support continued development of adjunctive phage therapy for some mycobacterial infections."

Derived by technological treatment of antibodies to interferon gamma, histamine, and CD4, Ergoferon was previously proved to modulate its molecular targets promoting effective antiviral protection. The data of 282 patients with oral temperature \u226538.0\u00b0C plus mild to moderate severity of flu-like nonspecific and nasal/throat/chest symptoms were included in intention-to-treat analysis (n\u2009=\u2009140, Ergoferon group; n\u2009=\u2009142, placebo group). Time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms was the primary endpoint, and 8 outcome measures were estimated as the secondary endpoints. Respiratory viruses were confirmed in 57.1% (Ergoferon) and 54.9% (Placebo) of patients. Compared to placebo, Ergoferon reduced time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms (4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 versus 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 days in placebo; p=0.026) including fever (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0; p=0.031), flu-like nonspecific (4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2, p=0.022), and nasal/throat/chest (4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 versus 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3; p=0.024) symptoms. Ergoferon add-on therapy decreased the mean total symptom severity score (according to 4-point scale for each symptom), ARI severity, frequency of antipyretic use, and percentage of complication requiring antibiotics and increased the percentage of recovered patients. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the Ergoferon group was significantly lower compared to the placebo group (7.0% versus 18.8%; p=0.004) including infectious diseases (3.5% vs 12.5%; p=0.008). In the Ergoferon group, AEs were mild or moderate. In 8 (57.1%) cases, AEs were unrelated to Ergoferon, in 5 (35.7%), the relationship was uncertain, and in 1 (7.1%), it was possible (mild rash on the face). Ergoferon treatment is beneficial for infants and young children with ARI in contemporary outpatient practice. Being well-tolerated, Ergoferon increases the symptomatic therapy effectiveness and improves the patient condition and disease outcomes."

Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infections, and they do not effectively manage viral infections like sinusitis, sore throats, bronchitis, influenza, and common respiratory infections. Presently no medication is available only symptomatic interventions is an option in our hand. However, a lot of research is going on the vaccine and drugs-based approaches against respiratory viruses worldwide. Traditional medicines are getting the attraction to treat many diseases. It is vital to screen the medicinal plants to find the potential of new compounds for treatment against antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Glycyrrhiza glabra L.

Meta-analysis showed reduction of mortality (RR 0.57, 95% CI [0.43, 0.76], z\u00a0=\u00a03.86 [p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001], I2 \u00a0=\u00a044% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.03]) and higher number of discharged patients (RR 2.53, 95% CI [1.72, 3.72], z\u00a0=\u00a04.70 [p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001], I2 \u00a0=\u00a03% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.39]) in patients receiving CPT compared to standard care alone. A possible mechanism of action is prompt reduction in viral titre. Serious transfusion-related adverse events were reported to be less than 1% of cases, suggesting the overall safety of CPT; nevertheless, the number of patients participating in the studies was still limited. It is also important to notice that in all the studies, the majority of patients were also given other medications, such as antivirals, antibiotics and corticosteroid; furthermore, randomized controlled studies involving more patients and in combination with other treatment modalities are urgently needed."

Benefitting from the application experience of Chinese Medicine (CM) for influenza and SARS, CM has been used to save patients at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in China.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CM, and compare with Western Medicine (WM) for COVID-19, we conducted a retrospective case series study based on the patients in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China.\nMETHODS: The inclusion and exclusion criteria of data extraction were set for this retrospective study. All patients who were admitted by the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital between January 17th and February 25th 2020 were considered. In addition, patients enrolled met the severe defined by the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. In these cases included in the study, CM or WM treatment was selected according to the wishes of the patients at the beginning of hospitalization. The patients in CM group were treated with Huashi Baidu granule (137\u00a0g po, bid) combined with the injections of Xiyanping (100\u00a0mg iv, bid), Xuebijing (100\u00a0ml iv, bid) and Shenmai (60\u00a0ml iv, qd) according to the syndrome of epidemic toxin blocking the lung in the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The WM group received antiviral therapy (including abidor capsule 0.2\u00a0g po, tid; Lopinavir-Ritonavir tablets, 500\u00a0mg po, bid), antibiotics (such as cefoperazone 2\u00a0g iv, bid; moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 0.4\u00a0g po, qd) or corticosteroid therapy (such as methylprednisolone succinate sodium 40 mg iv, qd; prednisone, 30\u00a0mg po, qd). In addition, patients in both groups received routine supportive treatment, including oxygen inhalation, symptomatic therapy, and/or human intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or serum albumin, and treatment for underlying diseases. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on changes related with clinical manifestations, computer tomography (CT) scan images, and laboratory examinations before and after the treatment.\nRESULTS: 55 severe COVID-19 patients, with 23 in CM group and 32 in WM group, were included for analyzed. There was no case of death, being transferred to ICU, or receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in two groups during hospitalization. The median time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in CM and WM group were 12 days and 15.5 days respectively, the ratio of nucleic acid negative conversion of CM group at different follow-up time points was significantly higher than that of WM group (HR: 2.281, P = 0.018). Further, the chest CT imaging showed more widely lung lesion opacity absorbed in the CM group. The high sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum ferritin decreased significantly in the CM group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in adverse events in terms of liver function and renal function between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Based on this retrospective analysis from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, CM has better effects in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, promoting lung lesion opacity absorbed and reducing inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients, which is effective and safe therapy for treating severe COVID-19 and reducing mortality."

We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of influenza among Chinese adults during this special season. A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.30, p&lt;\u00a0.001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants' use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination."

The primary outcomes were the time to defervescence and decrease of the Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score (PRESS) during hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were serial changes in virus titers, measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four patients were enrolled (28 in the control group and 26 in the combination group) in total. There were no differences in the patients' baseline characteristics between the groups. The time to defervescence was significantly shorter in the combination group than the oseltamivir group (13.2\u00a0h vs. 32.1\u00a0h, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

There were no differences in adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain during the study or within 30 days after antiviral therapy.\nCONCLUSION: The clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination group experienced a more rapid defervescence and a more rapid decline of influenza virus titer than the group treated with oseltamivir alone. Further consideration should be given to whether the overall benefits of combination therapy in hospitalized pediatric influenza patients outweigh the risks."

            "abstract": "Azithromycin (AZM) is a synthetic macrolide antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacterial and mycobacterial infections. Due to an additional range of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, it has been given to patients with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is now being investigated as a potential candidate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 having been identified as a candidate therapeutic for this virus by both in vitro and in silico drug screens. To date there are no randomised trial data on its use in any novel coronavirus infection, although a large number of trials are currently in progress. In this review, we summarise data from in vitro, murine and human clinical studies on the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of macrolides, particularly AZM. AZM reduces in vitro replication of several classes of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza A, Zika virus, Ebola, enteroviruses and coronaviruses, via several mechanisms. AZM enhances expression of anti-viral pattern recognition receptors and induction of anti-viral type I and III interferon responses. Of relevance to severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by an over-exuberant innate inflammatory response, AZM also has anti-inflammatory properties including suppression of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF and GM-CSF. AZM inhibits T cells by inhibiting calcineurin signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin activity and NF\u03baB activation. AZM particularly targets granulocytes where it concentrates markedly in lysosomes, particularly affecting accumulation, adhesion, degranulation and apoptosis of neutrophils. Given its proven safety, affordability and global availability, tempered by significant concerns about antimicrobial stewardship, there is an urgent mandate to perform well-designed and conducted randomised clinical trials."

All patients were examined for the presence of influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR. Patients of the main group received enisamium iodide along with symptomatic therapy, the control group received only symptomatic therapy. The primary parameter of the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated on the scale of the general severity of the manifestations of ARVI (Total Symptom Score TSS) from the 2nd to the 4th day and by the secondary criteria of effectiveness: assessment of the duration of ARVI, the severity of fever, the proportion of patients with normal body temperature, the duration of the main clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, the proportion of patients in whom complications requiring antibiotics were noted, the dynamics of interferon status on the 6th day. To conduct a statistical analysis, depending on the efficiency parameter, the ANCOVA method with a fixed group factor and an initial score on the TSS severity scale was used as covariates, a criterion for comparing quantitative indicators in two independent groups.\nRESULTS: According to the results of the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, the median (interquartile range) of the average score on the scale of the general severity of ARVI manifestations in the main group was 4.33 (3.675.83), in the comparison group 6.00 (4.677.25; p0.001). The duration of systemic and local manifestations of acute respiratory viral infections was statistically significantly less in the main group (p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). Prescription of additional therapy was required in 2 (2.9%) patients of the main group (patients taking enisamium iodide), compared with 8 (11.9%) patients in the control group. Serum levels of interferon \uf0e1 and interferon \uf0e3 on the last day of treatment were statistically significantly higher in patients of the main group compared with the control group (p0.001). Treatment (excellent) was evaluated by 42 (62.7%) patients, while in the control group only 17 (25.8%) patients gave similar ratings. Both patients (p0.001) and doctors (p0.002) rated therapy tolerance better in the study group.\nCONCLUSION: The results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of enisamium iodide as a treatment for ARVI and influenza. The antiviral, interferonogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are involved in the formation of an antiviral response and reduce the risk of complications, which makes it possible to reduce the number of symptomatic agents used."

Active TB incidence was compared between the two groups with 37\u00a0months of follow-up. Safety profile and complete rates were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 1227 adults with silicosis were screened; 513 eligible participants were enrolled and assigned to 3RPT/INH (n\u00a0=\u00a0254) vs. observation (n\u00a0=\u00a0259). Twenty-eight participants were diagnosed with active TB, and 9 and 19 in the 3RPT/INH group and observation groups, respectively. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative active TB rate was 3.5% (9/254) in the 3RPT/INH group and 7.3% (19/259) in the observation group (log rank p 0.055). On per protocol analysis, the cumulative active TB rates were 0.7% (1/139) and 7.3% (19/259), respectively (log rank p 0.01). Owing to an unexpected high frequency of adverse events (70.4%) and Grade 3 or 4 AEs (7.9%), the completion rate of the 3RPT/INH regimen was 54.7% (139/254). Twenty-six (10.8%) participants had flu-like systemic drug reactions; five (2.1%) experienced hepatotoxicity.\nDISCUSSION: Weekly rifapentine/isoniazid prophylaxis prevented active TB among Chinese people with silicosis when taken, irrespective of LTBI screening; efficacy was reduced by lack of compliance.

Early initiation of treatment is associated with improved outcomes. In clinical practice, empirical oseltamivir treatment is therefore commonly started prior to diagnostic microbiological confirmation. There is limited data on the patient characteristics, outcomes and safety of this practice. This study investigated outcomes and safety of this pre-emptive treatment strategy using oseltamivir.\nMETHODS: Descriptive analysis of LTRs who received oseltamivir for \u22652 days for suspected influenza infection between July 2011 and June 2012. Analyses were based on data from electronic medical records and our standardized LTR database with prospective documentation of clinical information including medication, laboratory and radiological results, outcomes and adverse events.\nRESULTS: We included 133 patients with a total of 261 oseltamivir treatment episodes (87.4% as outpatients). Median duration of oseltamivir treatment was 4 days (range 2 to 67) and 98.5% had concomitant antibiotic pharmacotherapy. Indications for oseltamivir included acute respiratory infection (66.7%), non-distinctive inflammatory reaction (51.3%) and influenza-like illness (2.7%). Influenza virus infection was confirmed by PCR in only 7%. Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen detected (14.9%). We discovered a wide range of adverse events but none occurred in >5%, and most were mild and of questionable causal relationship to oseltamivir administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: This non-controlled retrospective analysis suggests that the pre-emptive use of oseltamivir for respiratory tract infections pending microbiological results is safe in LTRs."

However, the optimal duration and dosage of aspirin remain inconsistent across hospitals. The absence of large-scale, multicenter randomized clinical trials hinders a clear understanding of the effectiveness of high-dose aspirin.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of IVIG alone compared with IVIG combined with high-dose aspirin as the active interventional therapy for KD and to compare treatment effectiveness across various KD subgroups.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prospective, evaluator-blinded, multicenter noninferiority randomized clinical trial, children (aged <6 years) who had been diagnosed with KD according to American Heart Association criteria were recruited from 5 medical centers in Taiwan and were enrolled between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2018, with follow-up assessments at 6 weeks and 6 months after treatment. Data were analyzed between January 23, 2023, and January 29, 2024.\nINTERVENTION: The standard group received IVIG (2 g/kg) plus high-dose aspirin (80-100 mg/kg per day) until fever subsided for 48 hours. The intervention group received IVIG (2 g/kg) alone.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the occurrence of CALs at 6 weeks. The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. Data analysis was performed using \u03c72 tests for categorical variables; independent t tests for continuous, normally distributed variables; generalized estimating equations for variables without specific distributions at multiple time points; and repeated-measures analysis of variance for continuous variables at multiple time points.\nRESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 134 patients with KD (mean [SD] age, 1.8 [1.3] years; 82 males [61.2%]), with matched age, weight, height, and sex distributions in 2 groups. Overall, in the IVIG plus aspirin group, among 69 patients, CAL occurrence decreased from 9 (13.0%) at baseline to 2 (2.9%) at 6 weeks and to 1 (1.4%) at 6 months. In the IVIG-only group, among 65 patients, CAL occurrence decreased from 7 (10.8%) at diagnosis to 1 (1.5%) at 6 weeks and to 2 (3.1%) at 6 months. No statistically significant differences in CAL frequency were observed between the 2 groups (0.7 percentage points [95% CI, -4.5 to 5.8 percentage points]; P\u2009=\u2009.65). There were also no significant differences in the treatment or prophylactic effect.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated the noninferiority of IVIG alone compared with IVIG plus aspirin, with a noninferiority margin set at 10%. The findings suggest that addition of high-dose aspirin during initial IVIG treatment is not clinically meaningful for CAL reduction in children with KD. Future studies on IVIG treatment alone for CAL reduction in KD across diverse racial and ethnic groups, beyond the Asian population, may be necessary to confirm minimal racial and ethnic variability and the broad applicability of these findings.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02951234."

Infants under 6 months represent a diagnostic challenge due to atypical or incomplete presentations, increasing the risk of coronary artery lesions and complications such as aneurysms. Early diagnosis and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin are crucial to prevent long-term cardiac sequelae. We report a rare case of KD in a 5-month-old Bangladeshi girl presenting with prolonged fever, rash, and sterile pyuria. Initial evaluations pointed to partially treated meningitis, delaying KD diagnosis. Subsequent symptoms included edema, osteoarthritis, and persistent inflammation, leading to an echocardiographic detection of a small coronary aneurysm. Treatment with IVIG, aspirin, and corticosteroids resulted in the resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac findings. Infants below 6 months often present with incomplete KD, complicating diagnosis and delaying treatment. This case underscores the importance of considering KD in febrile infants with persistent inflammation, even in the absence of classic symptoms. Echocardiography and laboratory markers remain essential for early detection and management.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is therefore essential to initiate appropriate therapeutic interventions. A 16-month-old boy presented with fever and diarrhea and was initially treated for infectious gastroenteritis, with elevated inflammatory markers noted (C-reactive protein (CRP) 4.47 mg/dL, white blood cell (WBC) 8,200/\u03bcL). As his condition progressed, he developed symptoms consistent with KD, including a rash and mucous membrane changes, and was treated with IVIG and aspirin. However, the fever persisted, and elevated inflammatory markers continued (CRP 3.93 mg/dL, WBC 9,700/\u03bcL), prompting additional immunosuppressive therapies for refractory KD. Ultrasound revealed gastrointestinal and lymph node abnormalities suggestive of vasculitis. Eventually, Y. ptsb. infection was confirmed through serology, and antibiotic treatment was reintroduced, leading to defervescence. This case highlights the challenge of distinguishing KD from Y. ptsb. infection because they can coexist, complicating treatment decisions. Rapid diagnostic methods for Y. ptsb., specifically through loop-mediated isothermal amplification-polymerase chain reaction (LAMP-PCR) testing, are crucial to guide timely treatment, particularly given the risk of coronary artery complications associated with both conditions."

            "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency typically appear normal at birth, and many are diagnosed through newborn screening programs. Symptomatic individuals experience hypoketotic hypoglycemia in response to either prolonged fasting (e.g., weaning the infant from nighttime feedings) or during intercurrent and common infections (e.g., viral gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infections), which typically cause loss of appetite and increased energy requirements when fever is present. Untreated severe hypoglycemic episodes can be accompanied by seizures, vomiting, lethargy, coma, and death. Metabolic decompensation during these episodes can result in elevated liver transaminases and hyperammonemia. Individuals with MCAD deficiency who have experienced the effects of uncontrolled metabolic decompensation are also at risk for chronic myopathy. Early identification and avoidance of prolonged fasting can ameliorate these findings. However, children with MCAD deficiency are at risk for obesity after initiation of treatment due to the frequency of feeding.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MCAD deficiency is established in a proband through biochemical testing (prominent accumulation of C8-acylcarnitine (octanoylcarnitine) with lesser elevations of C6-, C10-, and C10:1-acylcarnitines and elevated C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios) AND/OR by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ACADM by molecular genetic testing OR by significantly reduced activity of MCAD activity in blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Because of its relatively high sensitivity, ACADM molecular genetic testing can obviate the need for enzymatic testing, which is available only in limited academic centers.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: For routine daily treatment, fasting should be avoided and may require frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) in infancy, overnight feeding, a bedtime snack, or 2 g/kg of uncooked cornstarch to maintain blood glucose levels during sleep. A normal, healthy diet containing no more than 30% of total energy from fat is recommended. All individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid skipping meals and weight loss diets that recommend fasting. Prolonged or intense exercise should be covered by adequate carbohydrate intake and hydration. Intravenous glucose is recommended for surgical procedures that require several hours of fasting. Weight control measures such as regular education about proper nutrition and recommended physical exercise should be discussed to help avoid obesity.

For acute inpatient treatment, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately with 10% dextrose with appropriate electrolytes at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance rate or at 10-12 mg glucose/kg/minute to achieve and maintain a blood glucose level higher than 5 mmol/L, or between 120 and 170 mg/dL. Address electrolyte and pH imbalances with intravenous fluid management and initiate appropriate treatment for what triggered the metabolic stress. Surveillance: Infants should establish care with a biochemical genetics clinic including a metabolic dietitian as soon as possible following a positive newborn screen. A metabolic dietician should be involved to ensure proper nutrition in terms of quality and quantity. Affected infants should be seen in team clinic in two to three months, then every six to 12 months if otherwise clinically well; however, the frequency of routine follow-up visits is individualized based on comfort level of the affected persons, their families, and health care providers. Routine assessments for growth, acquisition of developmental milestones, neurobehavioral issues, and secondary carnitine deficiency are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hypoglycemia; infant formulas, coconut oil, and other manufactured foods containing medium-chain triglycerides as the primary source of fat; popular high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets; alcohol consumption, in particular acute alcohol intoxication (e.g., binge drinking), which can elicit metabolic decompensation; aspirin. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women who have MCAD deficiency must avoid catabolism. This is supported by several case reports describing carnitine deficiency, acute liver failure, and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) in pregnant women with MCAD deficiency.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: MCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the sibs of an affected individual are at a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being asymptomatic carriers, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not carriers. Because of the high carrier frequency for the ACADM c.985A&gt;G pathogenic variant in individuals of northern European origin, carrier testing should be discussed with reproductive partners of individuals with MCAD deficiency. Once both ACADM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MCAD deficiency are possible."

            "abstract": "This retrospective study assessed the efficacy of initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), aspirin, and corticosteroids in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients at risk for IVIG resistance. Data from pediatric patients with KD between January 2010 and December 2019 were divided into the IVIG-sensitive and IVIG-resistant groups based on treatment response. Risk factors for IVIG resistance were identified through univariate analysis. Outcomes included comparison of fever resolution time, hospital stay, and coronary artery lesion (CALs) incidence at multiple intervals post-treatment. An observational group (January 2020 to December 2022) was given additional methylprednisolone if they exhibited three or more IVIG resistance risk factors. The IVIG-resistant group had a higher proportion of males and significantly elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, PCT) and TBIL, NT-proBNP compared to the IVIG-sensitive group (all p\u2009<\u20090.05), while showing lower levels of albumin, ARR (AST/ALT ratio), and serum sodium (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Both the IVIG-sensitive and observational groups had significantly shorter fever resolution times and hospital stays than the IVIG-resistant group (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). CALs incidence was consistently higher in the IVIG-resistant group across all follow-up periods (all p\u2009<\u20090.05), with significant differences observed between the observational group and IVIG-resistant group at 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month post-treatment (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Notably, prior to treatment, the observational group had a higher CALs incidence compared to the IVIG-sensitive group (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). In children with KD who exhibit\u2009\u2265\u20093 risk factors for IVIG non-response, initial treatment with IVIG, aspirin, and glucocorticoids can effectively reduce fever duration, hospitalization duration, and incidence of CALs and is considered safe."

            "abstract": "RATIONALE: Kawasaki disease (KD) manifests as an acute, self-limited vasculitis disease that constitutes the primary cause of acquired heart disease in children under 5 years of age. Facial nerve palsy (FNP) is a rare complication associated with coronary artery lesions (CALs) in patients with KD. Patients with KD and FNP usually present atypically, leading to a delayed diagnosis and treatment of KD.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: A 4-month-old boy with fever, left FNP and bilateral conjunctival injection with spontaneous resolution, was admitted to the hospital, received a short course of intravenous dexamethasone, and experienced rapid FNP recovery on the first admission. The patient experienced a resurgence of fever, bilateral conjunctival injection, and right FNP, which led to readmission. Physical examination revealed redness at the site of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin inoculation, reddening of lips, and desquamation of the distal extremities. Echocardiography revealed right-sided CALs.\nDIAGNOSES: The patient initially missed KD on the first admission, and was later diagnosed with complete KD with FNP on the second admission.\nINTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: After a short course of intravenous dexamethasone, the left FNP resolved quickly. However, right FNP recurred after corticosteroids withdrawal. Meanwhile, more typical symptoms were observed, and KD was diagnosed. Treatment ensued with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), aspirin, and dexamethasone. The patient achieved rapid remission, without recurrence. Echocardiography continued to show normal findings during 1-year follow-up after discharge.\nLESSONS: The clinical symptoms of FNP complicating KD in children are atypical and can easily lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. FNP in patients with KD may serve as a risk factor for CALs, which are more challenging to resolve than the FNP itself. Adding corticosteroids to IVIG may be recommended to reduce IVIG resistance, decrease the risk of developing CALs, and alleviate CALs."

We present a compelling case of KD in a previously healthy 13-week-old infant who presented with fever, irritability, reduced feeding, and the subsequent development of classical mucocutaneous manifestations, including bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, cracked lips, and an erythematous rash. Laboratory findings revealed elevated inflammatory markers, thrombocytosis, and neutrophilic leukocytosis, consistent with the diagnosis.\u00a0The patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) at a dose of 2g/kg,\u00a0IV methylprednisolone, and a high dose of aspirin. The infant was eventually transferred to a tertiary care hospital for comprehensive management. The case is intriguing due to its presentation in an atypical age group. Prompt recognition and management of KD are crucial to prevent the development of coronary artery abnormalities. This case underscores the importance of considering KD in the differential diagnosis of infants with fever and unusual clinical presentations, even in the absence of typical cardiac involvement. Early identification and appropriate treatment are essential to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

Intravenous immunoglobulin gamma (IVIG) combined with aspirin therapy is the first-line regimen for the prevention of coronary aneurysms in the acute phase of KD. The etiology and pathogenesis of KD are unclear, but its incidence is increasing gradually, especially in the cases of IVIG-na\u00efve KD and refractory KD. Conventional therapies for refractory KD have unsatisfactory results. At present, infliximab (IFX), a human-murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), has made great progress in the treatment of KD. This review revealed that IFX infusion (5 mg/kg) could effectively modulate fever, reduce inflammation, improve arthritis, diminish the number of plasma exchange, decrease hospitalizations, and prevent the progression of coronary artery lesions. The adverse effects of IFX administration included skin rash, arthritis, respiratory disease, infusion reaction, hepatomegaly, and vaccination-associated complications. But the incidence of these adverse effects is low. The clear optimal application protocol of the application of IFX for either initial combination therapy or salvage therapy in KD is still under investigation. In addition, there are no effective biomarkers to predict IFX resistance. Further multicenter trials with large sample size and long-term follow-up are still needed to validate the clinical efficacy and safety of IFX for IVIG-resistant KD or refractory KD."

            "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis with a particular tropism for the coronary arteries. KD mainly affects male children between 6 months and 5 years of age. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the international American Heart Association criteria. It should be systematically considered in children with a fever, either of 5 days or more, or of 3 days if all other criteria are present. It is important to note that most children present with marked irritability and may have digestive signs. Although the biological inflammatory response is not specific, it is of great value for the diagnosis. Because of the difficulty of recognising incomplete or atypical forms of KD, and the need for urgent treatment, the child should be referred to a paediatric hospital as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. In the event of signs of heart failure (pallor, tachycardia, polypnea, sweating, hepatomegaly, unstable blood pressure), medical transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) is essential. The standard treatment is an infusion of IVIG combined with aspirin (before 10 days of fever, and for a minimum of 6 weeks), which reduces the risk of coronary aneurysms. In case of coronary involvement, antiplatelet therapy can be maintained for life. In case of a giant aneurysm, anticoagulant treatment is added to the antiplatelet agent. The prognosis of KD is generally good and most children recover without sequelae. The prognosis in children with initial coronary involvement depends on the progression of the cardiac anomalies, which are monitored during careful specialised cardiological follow-up."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that mainly affects children. Symptoms include fever, chapped lips, strawberry tongue, red eyes (bulbar conjunctival injection), rash, redness, swollen hands and feet or skin peeling; and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. High fevers and systemic inflammation characterise the acute phase. Inflammation of the coronary arteries causes the most serious complication of the disease, coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). The primary treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA/aspirin), with doses and regimens differing between institutions. It is important to know which regimens are the safest and most effective in preventing complications.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVIG in treating and preventing cardiac consequences of Kawasaki disease.\nSEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 26 April 2022.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of IVIG for the treatment of KD. We included studies involving treatment for initial or refractory KD, or both.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were incidence of CAAs and incidence of any adverse effects after treatment. Our secondary outcomes were acute coronary syndromes, duration of fever, need for additional treatment, length of hospital stay, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.\nMAIN RESULTS: We identified 31 RCTs involving a total of 4609 participants with KD. Studies compared IVIG with ASA, another dose or regimen of IVIG, prednisolone, or infliximab. The majority of studies reported on primary treatment, so those results are reported below. A limited number of studies investigated secondary or tertiary treatment in IVIG-resistant patients. Doses and regimens of IVIG infusion varied between studies, and all studies had some concerns related to risk of bias. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to ASA for people with KD Compared to ASA treatment, IVIG probably reduces the incidence of CAAs in people with KD up to 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.87; 11 studies, 1437 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The individual studies reported a range of adverse effects, but there was little to no difference in numbers of adverse effects between treatment groups (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.89; 10 studies, 1376 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was limited evidence for the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, so we are uncertain of any effects. Duration of fever days from treatment onset was probably shorter in the IVIG group (mean difference (MD) -4.00 days, 95% CI -5.06 to -2.93; 3 studies, 307 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little or no difference between groups in need for additional treatment (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.57; 3 studies, 272 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported length of hospital stay, and no deaths were reported in either group. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to different infusion regimens of IVIG for people with KD Higher-dose regimens of IVIG probably reduce the incidence of CAAs compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens of IVIG up to 30 days (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; 8 studies, 1824 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in the number of adverse effects between groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.37; 6 studies, 1659 participants; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on acute coronary syndromes. Higher-dose IVIG may reduce the duration of fever compared to medium- or lower-dose regimens (MD -0.71 days, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.06; 4 studies, 992 participants; low-certainty evidence). Higher-dose regimens may reduce the need for additional treatment (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 4 studies, 1125 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear difference in length of hospital stay between infusion regimens (MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.30; 3 studies, 752 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported mortality, and there was little to no difference detected between regimens (moderate-certainty evidence). Primary treatment with IVIG compared to prednisolone for people with KD The evidence comparing IVIG with prednisolone on incidence of CAA is very uncertain (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.48; 2 studies, 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there was little to no difference between groups in adverse effects (OR 4.18, 95% CI 0.19 to 89.48; 1 study; 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the impact on duration of fever, as two studies reported this outcome differently and showed conflicting results. One study reported on acute coronary syndromes and mortality, finding little or no difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). No study reported the need for additional treatment or length of hospital stay.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included RCTs investigated a variety of comparisons, and the small number of events observed during the study periods limited detection of effects. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low due to concerns related to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. The available evidence indicated that high-dose IVIG regimens are probably associated with a reduced risk of CAA formation compared to ASA or medium- or low-dose IVIG regimens. There were no clinically significant differences in incidence of adverse effects, which suggests there is little concern about the safety of IVIG. Compared to ASA, high-dose IVIG probably reduced the duration of fever, but there was little or no difference detected in the need for additional treatment. Compared to medium- or low-dose IVIG, there may be reduced duration of fever and reduced need for additional treatment. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding acute coronary syndromes, mortality, or length of hospital stay, or for the comparison IVIG versus prednisolone. Our findings are in keeping with current guideline recommendations and evidence from long-term epidemiology studies."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has increasingly been documented globally with the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant proportion of cases have been noted in children of Black descent. There has been a noticeable discrepancy in the presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in sub-Saharan Africa compared to the rest of the world. We documented the demography, clinical features, laboratory and imaging findings, therapeutic management, and short-term outcomes of paediatric patients with MIS-C diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lagos, Nigeria.\nMETHODS: We carried out a retrospective review of MIS-C cases seen in nine public and private hospitals in Lagos from July 10, 2020 to July 30, 2021. Data on clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, therapy as well as outcomes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months were analyzed.\nFINDINGS: 28 children and adolescents with median age of 7\u00b75 (IQR 2\u00b73 - 9\u00b74) years were diagnosed with MIS-C. MIS-C was suspected in 24 patients (85\u00b77%) at initial clinical evaluation and mucocutaneous, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular manifestations were identified in 75\u00b70%, 71\u00b74% and 89\u00b73% of patients respectively. Acute kidney injury and aseptic meningitis were noted in 32\u00b71% and 17\u00b79% of patients respectively. Cardiac manifestations at presentation included coronary dilatation and pericardial effusion in 46\u00b74% each, ventricular dysfunction (32\u00b71%), atrioventricular valve regurgitation (25\u00b70%), prolonged QTc interval (40\u00b70%) and first-degree atrioventricular block (16\u00b70%). Therapy included aspirin in 89\u00b73%, steroids in 75\u00b70% and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion in 60\u00b77%. All patients survived and were discharged after a mean of 11\u00b714 (SD 5\u00b765) days. Frequency of coronary dilatation had reduced from 46\u00b74% to 7\u00b71% by 3 months follow up and prolonged QTc interval persisted until the 6 week follow up in 4.5% of patients. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram findings were normal in all patients assessed at 6 months follow up.\nINTERPRETATION: MIS-C is an important diagnosis in children presenting with prolonged fever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular manifestations occurred in several children with MIS-C and improved by 6 months follow up. Early diagnosis and prompt institution of a combination of antiplatelet therapy, steroids and IVIG appear to be beneficial.\nFUNDING: None."

There is much controversy on how best to treat children with KD and in particular who may benefit from additional treatment beyond the standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin, such as the addition of corticosteroids. This is an update of the review first published in 2017.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of corticosteroid use on the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities in KD as either first-line or second-line treatment.\nSEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and two trials registers to 8 February 2021. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials involving children with all severities of KD who were treated with corticosteroids, including different types of corticosteroids, different durations of treatment, and where corticosteroids were used alone or in conjunction with other accepted KD treatments. We included trials using corticosteroids for both first- and second-line treatment.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted data using standard Cochrane methods. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The outcomes of interest were incidence of coronary artery abnormalities, serious adverse events, mortality, duration of acute symptoms (such as fever), time for laboratory parameters to normalise, length of hospital stay and longer-term coronary morbidity.\nMAIN RESULTS: This update identified one new study, therefore the analysis included eight trials consisting of 1877 participants. Seven trials investigated the use of corticosteroids in first-line treatment and one investigated second-line treatment. The trials were all of good methodological quality. On pooled analysis, corticosteroid treatment reduced the subsequent occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.75; 8 studies, 986 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), without resultant serious adverse events (0 events; 6 studies, 737 participants; moderate-certainty) and mortality (0 events; 8 studies, 1075 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In addition, corticosteroids reduced the duration of fever (MD -1.34 days, 95% CI -2.24 to -0.45; 3 studies, 290 participants; low-certainty evidence), time for laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) to normalise (MD -2.80 days, 95% CI -4.38 to -1.22; 1 study, 178 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and length of hospital stay (MD -1.01 days, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.30; 2 studies, 119 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported long-term (greater than one year after disease onset) coronary morbidity.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence shows that use of steroids in the acute phase of KD can be associated with reduced coronary artery abnormalities, reduced inflammatory markers and shorter duration of hospital stay when compared to no corticosteroids. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported with or without corticosteroid use. Low-certainty evidence shows use of corticosteroids can reduce duration of clinical symptoms (fever and rash). None of the included studies reported on long-term (greater than one year after disease onset) coronary morbidity. Evidence presented in this systematic review agrees with current clinical guidelines on the use of corticosteroids in the first-line treatment in KD."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the current consensus recommends a standard treatment of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin with high-dose aspirin to manage Kawasaki disease (KD), the use of different adjunctive therapies remains controversial. The aim of the current network meta-analysis (NMA) was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of different existing interventions for the initial and refractory stages of KD.\nMETHODS: An NMA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using the frequentist model applied after electronic searches in PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science. The main outcomes were reduced fever duration/diminished severity of fever subsided. The initial stage of KD was defined as the first stage to treat patients with KD; the refractory stage of KD represents KD patients who failed to respond to standard KD treatment. The cut-off points for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were low (100-400\u00a0mg), medium (1\u00a0g), and high (at least 2\u00a0g).\nFINDINGS: A total of fifty-six RCTs with 6486 participants were included. NMA demonstrated that the medium-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0aspirin\u00a0+\u00a0infliximab [mean difference=-1.76 days (95% confidence intervals (95% CIs): -3.65 to 0.13 days) compared to high-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0aspirin] exhibited the shortest fever duration; likewise, the medium-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0aspirin\u00a0+\u00a0infliximab [odds ratio (OR)=0.50, 95% CIs: 0.18-1.37 compared to high-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0aspirin] exhibited the smallest incidence of coronary artery lesion (CAL) in the initial-stage KD. In the refractory-stage KD, the high-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0pulse steroid therapy (OR=0.04, 95% CIs: 0.00-0.43 compared to the high-dosage IVIG only) had the best rate of decline of fever; likewise, the high-dosage IVIG\u00a0+\u00a0ciclosporin [OR=0.05 (95% CIs: 0.00-1.21) compared to the high-dosage IVIG only] exhibited the smallest incidence of CAL. Infliximab significantly improved resolution compared to the high-dosage IVIG only group (OR=0.20, 95%CIs: 0.07-0.62) in refractory-stage KD.\nINTERPRETATION: The NMA demonstrated that the combination therapy with the standard therapy of IVIG and aspirin might have an additional effect on shortening the duration of fever and lowering the CAL incidence rate in patients with acute KD. Moreover, the combination therapy with high-dose IVIG and pulse steroid therapy or cyclosporine therapy might have an additional effect on improving the rate of decline of fever and lowering the incidence rate of CAL in children with refractory KD. Because some of the findings of this NMA should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory, further evidence from de novo randomised trials is needed to support our results.\nFUNDING: None."

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched. A total of 34 randomized clinical trials were included in this systematic review. We assessed the risk of bias of all included studies using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias assessment. The evidence on ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac, and other NSAIDs were rated for degree of uncertainty for each of the study outcomes and summarized using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Our findings suggest that high-quality evidence supports the use of NSAIDs to reduce fever in both adults and children. However, the evidence was uncertain for the use of NSAIDs to reduce cough. Most studies showed that NSAIDs significantly relieved sore throat. The evidence for mortality and oxygenation is limited. Regarding the adverse events, gastrointestinal discomfort was more frequently reported in children. For adults, our overall certainty in effect estimates was low and the increase in gastrointestinal adverse events was not clinically significant. In conclusion, NSAIDs seem to be beneficial in the outpatient management of fever and sore throat in adults and children. Although the evidence does not support their use to decrease mortality nor improve oxygenation in inpatient settings, the use of NSAIDs did not increase the rate of death or the need for ventilation in patients with respiratory tract infections. Further studies with a robust methodology and larger sample sizes are recommended."

Atypical Kawasaki disease applies to patients who do not fulfill the complete criteria of fever of 5\u00a0days or more with at least four of five features: bilateral conjunctival injection, changes in the lips and oral cavity, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes, and polymorphous rash. Acute kidney injury is defined as a sudden decline in kidney function within hours, including structural injuries and loss of function. Acute kidney injury is extremely common in hospitalized pediatric patients. However, it is rarely documented in Kawasaki disease. Acute kidney injury is underestimated in Kawasaki disease due to the lack of a clear definition of age-specific normal serum creatinine levels and routine renal functions. This report describes a case who presented with clinical features suggestive of atypical Kawasaki disease and developed acute kidney injury.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old Saudi girl had a history of high-grade fever for 5\u00a0days, moderate dehydration, dry cracked lips, poor appetite, and generalized erythematous rash; therefore, she was diagnosed to have incomplete Kawasaki disease. Laboratory investigations revealed normochromic normocytic anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, high inflammatory markers, and acute kidney injury stage III. An echocardiogram showed a 4-mm dilatation on the left main coronary artery and a 3-mm dilatation on the right. A renal biopsy was not performed to identify the cause of the injury as it showed improvements after the start of the specific therapy for Kawasaki disease; intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 2\u00a0g/kg, aspirin at a high dosage of 80\u00a0mg/kg/day, and prednisolone at 2\u00a0mg/kg. In addition to the acute kidney injury management, normal saline boluses were followed by furosemide at a 2\u00a0mg/kg dose. Her urine output increased, and her renal functions normalized. She was discharged in good condition after 10\u00a0days.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is valuable to check renal function tests in a confirmed case of Kawasaki disease to reduce the negative consequences of late acute kidney injury discovery. Early detection and intervention make a substantial difference in acute kidney injury management."

            "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are inflammatory conditions that present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the physician. Although many of their features overlap, they are two distinct conditions. KD is a febrile illness most commonly affecting children younger than five years. It manifests with prolonged fever and at least four of the following features: bilateral bulbar conjunctivitis, mucositis, diffuse maculopapular rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy of 1.5 cm or more in diameter. Patients with MIS-C may have many of the same manifestations but tend to have higher rates of gastrointestinal and neurocognitive symptoms and signs of shock on presentation. Both conditions are associated with cardiac sequelae, including coronary artery aneurysms, although children with MIS-C are at high risk of developing ventricular dysfunction and depressed cardiac output. Lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide are key laboratory findings of MIS-C that can help distinguish it from KD. The use of intravenous immune globulin is well established in KD and also appears to have a role in the treatment of MIS-C. Aspirin has been used in KD for an anti-inflammatory effect, and low-dose aspirin is recommended for MIS-C to reduce the risk of thrombosis. In addition to supportive care, patients with MIS-C may benefit from immunomodulatory medications, although data on this topic are evolving."

            "title": "Variation in Pharmacologic Management of Patients with Kawasaki Disease with Coronary Artery Aneurysms.",
            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate practice variation in pharmacologic management in the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Practice variation in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, anti-inflammatory agents, statins, beta-blockers, antiplatelet therapy, and anticoagulation was described.\nRESULTS: We included 1627 patients from 30 IKDR centers with maximum coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) z scores 2.5-4.99 in 848, 5.0-9.99 in 349, and \u226510.0 (large/giant) in 430 patients. All centers reported IVIG and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as primary therapy and use of additional IVIG or steroids as needed. In 23 out of 30 centers, (77%) infliximab was also used; 11 of these 23 centers reported using it in <10% of their patients, and 3 centers used it in >20% of patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were used in >10% of patients in only nine centers. Beta-blocker (8.8%, all patients) and abciximab (3.6%, all patients) were mainly prescribed in patients with large/giant CAAs. Statins (2.7%, all patients) were mostly used in one center and only in patients with large/giant CAAs. ASA was the primary antiplatelet modality for 99% of patients, used in all centers. Clopidogrel (18%, all patients) was used in 24 centers, 11 of which used it in >50% of their patients with large/giant CAAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the IKDR, IVIG and ASA therapy as primary therapy is universal with common use of a second dose of IVIG for persistent fever. There is practice variation among centers for adjunctive therapies and anticoagulation strategies, likely reflecting ongoing knowledge gaps. Randomized controlled trials nested in a high-quality collaborative registry may be an efficient strategy to reduce practice variation."

            "title": "Perspective of Immunopathogenesis and Immunotherapies for Kawasaki Disease.",
            "abstract": "Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute inflammatory illness that mostly occurs in children below 5 years of age, with intractable fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and lesions of the coronary artery (CAL). KD is sharing clinical symptoms with systemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which is related to COVID-19. Certain genes are identified to be associated with KD, but the findings usually differ between countries and races. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele types and toll-like receptor (TLR) expression are also correlated to KD. The acute hyperinflammation in KD is mediated by an imbalance between augmented T helper 17 (Th17)/Th1 responses with high levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10, in contrast to reduced Th2/Treg responses with lower IL-4, IL-5, FoxP3, and TGF-\u03b2 expression. KD has varying phenotypic variations regarding age, gender, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance, macrophage activation and shock syndrome. The signs of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can be interpreted as hyperferritinemia and thrombocytopenia contradictory to thrombocytosis in typical KD; the signs of KD with shock syndrome (KDSS) can be interpreted as overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and coagulopathy. For over five decades, IVIG and aspirin are the standard treatment for KD. However, some KD patients are refractory to IVIG required additional medications against inflammation. Further studies are proposed to delineate the immunopathogenesis of IVIG-resistance and KDSS, to identify high risk patients with genetic susceptibility, and to develop an ideal treatment regimen, such as by providing idiotypic immunoglobulins to curb cytokine storms, NO overproduction, and the epigenetic induction of Treg function."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the continued societal and policy interest in cannabinoids, the Penn State Harrisburg Center for Survey Research (CSR) conducted a web survey (Cannabinoid Lion Poll) for adult-aged Pennsylvanians between March 6 and April 2, 2023.\nMETHODS: The Lion Poll omnibus survey asked questions of adult-aged Pennsylvanians to assess awareness of cannabidiol (CBD) and products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), including marijuana, the likelihood of reporting cannabinoid use to health care providers (HCPs), and perceptions regarding safety.\nRESULTS: Of these 1,045 respondents, 51.2% were female; 83.0% were white, non-Hispanic; and 48.6% and 27.5% were within the 35-64-year and 18-34-year age ranges, respectively. Of the respondents, 52.1% and 53.9% told their HCPs they took CBD or products containing THC, respectively. Alcohol was perceived by the large proportion of respondents as unsafe (47.3%), followed by products containing THC (25.2%), anxiety/depression medications (21.7%), CBD (16.1%), and over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications (8.1%). Most combinations were perceived to be unsafe when asked to consider the safety of taking them with other prescription medications. Again, alcohol was perceived to be unsafe by the largest proportion (77.4%), followed by anxiety/depression medications (43.2%), products containing THC (42.6%), CBD (33.4%), and then OTC pain medications (24.8%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adult-aged Pennsylvanians perceive CBD and THC containing products as safer than alcohol. There is considerable underreporting of cannabinoid use to HCPs, and therefore significant implications for patient safety. It remains vital that HCPs have open communications with their patients about cannabinoid use."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Australian prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) provide information about a patient's recent medication history for controlled drugs at the point of prescribing and dispensing. Despite their increasing use, the evidence for PDMPs is mixed, and is almost exclusively from the United States. This study examined the impact of PDMP implementation on opioid prescribing among general practitioners in Victoria, Australia.\nMETHOD: We examined data on analgesic prescribing using electronic records of 464 medical practices in the Australian state of Victoria between 01/04/2017 and 31/12/ 2020. We used interrupted time series analyses, to examine immediate and longer-term trends in medication prescribing following voluntary (from April 2019) and mandatory PDMP implementation (from April 2020). We examined changes in three outcomes (i) 'high' opioid dose (50-100mg oral morphine equivalent daily dose (OMEDD) and over 100mg (OMEDD) prescribing (ii) prescribing of high-risk medication combinations (opioids with either benzodiazepines or pregabalin), and (iii) initiation of non-controlled pain medications (tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin and tramadol).\nRESULTS: We found no effect of voluntary or mandatory PDMP implementation on 'high-dose' opioid prescribing with reductions only seen in those prescribed <20mg OMEDD (i.e., the lowest dose category). Co-prescribing of opioids with benzodiazepines (additional 11.87 [95%CI 2.04 to 21.67] patients/10,000 and pregabalin (additional 3.54 [95% CI 0.82 to 6.26] patients/10,000 increased following mandatory PDMP implementation among those prescribed opioids. In contrast to trends of reduced initiation prior to PDMP implementation, we found increased new initiation of non-monitored medications following PDMP implementation (e.g., an immediate increase of 2.32 [95%CI 0.02 to 4.54], patients/10,000 received pregabalin and 3.06 [95%CI 0.54 to 5.5] patients/10,000 received tricyclic antidepressants after mandatory PDMP implementation), and increased tramadol initiation during the voluntary PDMP period (an increase of 11.26 [95%CI: 5.84, 16.67] patients /10,000).\nCONCLUSION: PDMP implementation did not appear to reduce prescribing of high opioid doses or high-risk combinations. Increased initiation of tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin and tramadol may indicate a possible unintended effect."

            "title": "Prescription of Controlled Substances: Benefits and Risks",
            "abstract": "None: One of the most difficult challenges for any prescriber is distinguishing between the legitimate prescription of controlled substances versus the prescription potentially used for illegitimate purposes. To discern the difference, prescribers need to understand the signs, symptoms, and treatment of acute and chronic pain and the signs and symptoms of patients misusing controlled substances. A common reason people seek\u00a0the care of medical professionals is pain relief. While many categories of pain medications are available, opioid analgesics are FDA-approved for moderate to severe pain. As such, they are a common choice for patients with acute, cancer-related, neurologic, and end-of-life pain. Prescribing opioid analgesics for chronic pain is controversial and fraught with inconclusive standards. In the 1990s, due to the chronic failure of health professionals to treat severe pain appropriately,\u00a0opioid analgesic prescribing was expanded. Unfortunately, this led to increased overuse, diversion of drugs, opioid use disorder, and overdose. The \"Catch-22\" seems to be either\u00a0health professionals undertreat, and there is needless suffering, or they overtreat, with the potential to cause adverse effects like\u00a0increased opioid analgesic use disorder and potential overdose. The prescribing of opioid analgesics peaked in 2011. Since then, both prescribing and overdose have been declining, yet as a society, in both the lay and scientific literature, there are grave concerns that\u00a0we are still in the middle of an opioid crisis. Perhaps the biggest challenge of caring for patients with pain is that individuals have different tolerance levels and require variable opioid doses to obtain adequate pain relief. Patients may have a range of behavioral, cultural, emotional, and psychologic responses to pain versus a substance use disorder; often, it is challenging to tell the difference. All health professionals engaged in pain management need an understanding of the treatment recommendations and safety concerns in prescribing opioid analgesics. Appropriate opioid prescribing requires a thorough patient assessment, short and long-term treatment planning, close follow-up, and continued monitoring. All providers need to be aware of appropriate patient assessment and treatment planning and the possibility of use disorder, diversion, and potentially dangerous behavioral responses to controlled substances, e.g., opioid analgesics differ from pseudoaddiction and physical dependence. It is clear that many clinicians know little about opioid use disorder. They do not understand it is a disease, and many believe opioid dependence is the same as opioid use disorder. Lack of a clear understanding results in clinicians confusing a patient with chronic non-use disorder with the one misusing their prescribed opioid. Lack of training and educational deficits often interfere with the appropriate\u00a0prescription of opioid analgesic agents. To prevent the misuse of controlled substances, providers that prescribe controlled substances should learn prescribing practices that\u00a0minimize or prevent adverse consequences. Definitions:  Addiction - according to the\u00a0American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM): \"Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social, and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward or relief by substance use and other behaviors.\" Addiction is now termed \"use disorder\" and is characterized by an inability to consistently abstain, craving the drug, impairment in behavioral control, diminished ability to recognize significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, use disorder often involves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in recovery activities, use disorder is progressive and can result in disability or premature death.\"\u00a0\u00a0: Appropriate opioid analgesic prescribing: This involves providing pain control while minimizing toxicity, use disorder, or the risk of use disorder and implementing safeguards to reduce drug diversion. Inappropriate opioid analgesic prescribing: non-prescribing, inadequate prescribing, excessive prescribing, or continued prescribing despite evidence of the lack of effective\u00a0opioid analgesic treatment. Controlled substances: These are drugs or medications that possess the potential for being misused and are\u00a0considered to be substances that have a substantially high risk of resulting in substance use disorder. Opioid analgesics:\u00a0these are drugs that dull the senses and relieve pain, e.g., morphine. Also, these medications may\u00a0induce sleep. Please note that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA, USA) uses the term \"narcotic\" to refer to drugs that are opioid analgesics. Five Characteristics of Addiction/Use Disorder (ASAM):  1. Craving for drugs or rewards. 2. Diminished recognition of significant problems in one's behavior. 3. Dysfunctional emotional response. 4. Impairment in behavioral control. 5. Inability to consistently abstain\u00a0. Drug Schedules of Controlled Substances All providers should be familiar with the guidelines and laws for each schedule, which have, as their basis, the purpose of the drug and the risk of use disorder. In the United States, controlled substances are under strict regulation by both federal and state laws that guide their manufacture and distribution. Controlled substances have a high risk of resulting in addiction and substance use disorder. As the schedules decrease, I-V,\u00a0the drugs listed\u00a0within each category have a lower potential to cause a substance use or\u00a0addiction disorder.\u00a0 Controlled Substance Act In the United States, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was passed in 1970, and it included the\u00a0Controlled Substance Act. The Controlled Substance Act covers drug: Classification and regulation, according to their content and purpose. Manufacturing. Distribution. Exportation and sale. The Controlled Substance Act established five drug schedules and classified them to control their manufacture and\u00a0distribution. Part of the regulation requires providers prescribing scheduled drugs and pharmacists filling them to obtain a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Health professionals' licenses include specific license numbers allowing controlled substance prescriptions to be tracked and linked to a particular provider or distributor. Each of the five schedules has parameters based on their medical value, the risk of addiction, and the ability to cause harm. The schedules range from Schedule I (most potential for addiction/use disorder) to Schedule V (least potential for addiction/use disorder). Schedule I:  Schedule I drugs possess the highest potential for use disorder and misuse. They\u00a0have no medical use and are illicit or \"street\" drugs. Examples of Schedule I drugs include heroin, lysergic acid\u00a0diethylamide, mescaline, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and methaqualone. Marijuana, which is legal in some states, is still classified as a\u00a0Schedule I drug at the federal level as of this writing. Schedule II:  Schedule II drugs have a reduced potential for use disorders than Schedule I. They are at high risk for both physical and psychological dependence. They have a high capacity for both use disorder and misuse.\u00a0They are typically prescribed to treat severe pain, anxiety,\u00a0insomnia, and ADHD. Examples of Schedule II substances include\u00a0fentanyl, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, methamphetamine, pentobarbital,\u00a0and secobarbital. They previously had to be prescribed only via paper prescription but now are permitted to be electronically transmitted. (Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances or EPCS). No refills are allowed.\u00a0. Schedule II drugs have the tightest regulations when\u00a0compared to other prescription drugs. Schedule III:  Schedule III drugs have a lower misuse potential than I and II. Drugs in this category\u00a0may cause\u00a0physical dependence but more commonly lead to psychological\u00a0dependence. Medications in this category are often used for pain control, or anesthesia, or appetite suppression. Examples of Schedule III substances include benzphetamine, ketamine, phendimetrazine, and anabolic steroids. Opioid analgesics in this schedule include products containing not more than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit and buprenorphine. Schedule III drugs are prescribable verbally over the phone, with a paper prescription, or via EPCS. Within a six-month time frame, refill requirements are such that the drug can only have five refills.\u00a0. Schedule IV:  Schedule IV drugs have an even lower misuse potential than I, II, or III. They have a limited risk of physical or psychological dependence. Examples of Schedule IV substances include: alprazolam, carisoprodol, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, temazepam, tramadol, and triazolam. Drugs in this class may be utilized for pain control as\u00a0long as the provider deems the drug medically necessary and the patient would benefit. Schedule IV drugs are prescribable verbally over the phone, with a paper prescription, or via EPCS. Refills are permitted up to five times in a six-month\u00a0timeframe from the issuance date. Schedule V:  Schedule V drugs are the least likely of the controlled substances to be misused.\u00a0They result in very limited physical or psychological dependence. Examples include cough medicines with codeine, antidiarrheal medications that contain\u00a0atropine/diphenoxylate, pregabalin, and ezogabine. Despite their low abuse potential, they still need to be managed appropriately and administered with care. When they contain codeine, it must have less than 200 mg of codeine\u00a0per 100 mL. Partial prescription fills cannot occur more than\u00a0six months after the issue date. When a partial fill occurs, it is treated in the\u00a0same manner and with the same rules as a refill of the drug. Drug Use Disorder, Abuse, and Misuse The use disorder of a drug differs from abuse and misuse\u00a0of a drug. The drugs taken may be illicit street or stolen drugs or obtained via a legal prescription. Misusing a drug usually involves taking the drug in a harmful or detrimental way, resulting in personal, professional, or social problems. A patient abusing an opioid analgesic may no longer be appropriately interacting with their family or friends or be able to perform their duties at work. Misuse of a controlled substance refers to using a prescribed drug in a way that was not\u00a0intended. It may be deliberate or accidental. A negative result may or may not occur. Examples of misuse include taking too much of a drug, using an incorrect dose, an incorrect route, or using prescription drugs written for another person. Controlled substances include both prescription drugs and illicit drugs with no recognized medical value. Both have the potential to be abused or misused. While Schedule I drug use is illegal, prescription drugs found in Schedules II-V are also commonly abused and misused, and their misuse is a challenging problem that has increased over the last several years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared prescription drug abuse a problem of epidemic\u00a0proportions. The CDC believes that absent checks and balances on the prescription and distribution of controlled substances, including those prescribed for\u00a0medical use, have the potential for abuse and that misuse will continue to\u00a0increase. Prescriber\u00a0Shopping Unfortunately, a common practice among those who deliberately misuse controlled substances is to seek out\u00a0multiple sources of drugs. They do this by seeing different health care providers and presenting with a list of complaints that are often fictitious and different for each provider. The patient may be able to\u00a0obtain multiple prescriptions\u00a0and then fill them at different pharmacies. Many states have enacted systems that allow providers to see all of the prescriptions written for each patient. The use of these systems is gradually curbing \"prescriber shopping.\" Diversion Some prescription drugs will sell on the street for as much as $50 a tablet.\u00a0Diversion is when a patient sells their drugs as a method of earning money. Drugs may also be sold to buy food, pay expenses, or purchase more potent street drugs. Worse, in some cases, healthcare providers may divert drugs from patients\u00a0for the providers' personal use\u00a0or sell them to someone else. Some individuals use controlled substances in ways for which they were not originally intended. Rather than pain control, they may be used to stay awake, induce sleep, or get \"high.\" Before the popularity of prescription drug diversion, the only method to obtain illicit drugs was to import from other countries or manufacture them in private labs. Today, law enforcement agencies have the tremendous challenge of dealing with prescription drugs sold by diversion and illicit drugs imported or manufactured. In both instances, these drug sales and usage result in increased criminal activity, dangerous overdoses, and death.\u00a0 Methods of Obtaining Prescription Drugs A review of multiple studies demonstrates a variety of ways individuals obtain prescription drugs. The following summarizes the studies' findings. 55% free from a friend or relative. 20% from a prescriber. 10% purchased from a friend or relative. 5% stolen from a friend or relative. 5% purchased from a drug dealer. 2% from multiple doctors. 1% from theft from medical practice or pharmacy. Less than 1% obtain them from the internet. Studies also reveal the source of the majority of these drugs was a single legal prescriber. Provider Opioid Knowledge Deficit\u00a0 There are substantial knowledge gaps around appropriate and inappropriate opioid analgesic prescribing, including deficits in understanding current research, legislation, and appropriate prescribing practices. Providers often have knowledge deficits that include: Understanding of addiction. At-risk opioid addiction populations. Prescription vs. non-prescription opioid addiction. The belief that addiction and dependence on opioids are synonymous. The belief that opioid addiction is a psychological problem instead related to a chronic painful disease. With a long history of misunderstanding, poor society, provider education, and inconsistent laws, prescribing opioids has resulted in significant societal challenges that will only be resolved with significant education and training. Misuse of Controlled Substances Unfortunately, the misuse of controlled substances resulting in morbidity and mortality is rampant.\u00a0According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2016, performed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, over 10 million people misuse prescription pain medications, and over 2 million misuse sedatives, stimulants, and tranquilizers each year. The same study found that the most common reason for misuse is for treating physical pain. The Centers for Disease Control estimates more than 40,000 people die each year from an opioid overdose.\u00a0 Controlled Substances Three common classes of controlled substances are commonly misused: opioids, depressants, and stimulants.\u00a0 Opioids Opioids are prescribed for pain control by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system reducing pain signals to the brain as well as receptors in the GI tract and respiratory system, and are used to treat pain, diarrhea, and cough. Common Opioids Codeine -\u00a0One of the most commonly taken opioid medications. It is at the center of the opioid addiction problem in the United States and thus is highly regulated. Its main indications\u00a0are pain and cough. FDA-Approved Indication Pain Codeine plays a role in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Its use is recognized in chronic pain due to ongoing cancer and palliative care. However, the use of codeine to treat other types of chronic pain remains controversial. Chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain, is pain persisting beyond the standard tissue healing time, which is three months.[1] The most prevalent causes of non-cancer chronic pain include back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and headache. Non-FDA Approved Indications Cough Codeine is useful in the treatment of various etiologies producing chronic cough. Also, 46% of patients with chronic cough do not have a distinct etiology despite a proper diagnostic evaluation. Codeine produces a decrease in cough frequency and severity in these patients. However, there is limited literature demonstrating the efficacy of codeine in chronic cough. The dose can vary from 15 mg to 120 mg a day. It is, however, indicated in the management of prolonged cough (in specific populations like lung cancer) usually as 30 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Restless Leg Syndrome Codeine is effective in treating restless leg syndrome when given at night time, especially for those whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Persistent Diarrhea (Palliative) Codeine and loperamide are equally effective, and the choice between them has its basis in the assessment of the physician evaluating the small but undoubted addictive potential of codeine versus the higher cost of loperamide and an individual difference in patient's vulnerability to adverse effects. Fentanyl -\u00a0Transdermal patch and IV, commonly abused and used in mixture with other drugs. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80\u00a0to 100 times stronger than morphine and is often added to heroin to increase its potency. It can cause severe respiratory depression and death, particularly when mixed with other drugs or alcohol. It has high addiction potential. Hydrocodone -\u00a0Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain. Immediate-release (IR) hydrocodone is available as a combination product (combined with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.) and is FDA approved for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative (non-opioid) treatments are inadequate. Single-entity hydrocodone is only available in extended-release (ER) formulations. It is FDA approved to treat persistent pain severe enough to require 24-hour, long-term opioid treatment, for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydrocodone is also an antitussive and is indicated for cough in adults. Morphine Sulfate -\u00a0FDA-approved usage of morphine sulfate includes moderate to severe pain that may be acute or chronic. Most commonly used in pain management, morphine provides significant relief to patients afflicted with pain. Clinical situations that significantly benefit from medicating with morphine include managing palliative/end-of-life care, active cancer treatment, and vaso-occlusive pain during sickle cell crises. Morphine is widely used off-label for almost any condition that causes pain. In the emergency department, morphine is given for musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis, and even headaches when patients fail to respond to first and second-line agents. Morphine is rarely used for procedural sedation. However, clinicians will sometimes combine a low dose of morphine with a low dose of benzodiazepine-like lorazepam for minor procedures. Oxycodone -\u00a0An opioid agonist prescription medication. The oxycodone immediate-release formulation is FDA-approved for managing acute or chronic moderate to severe pain for which other treatments do not suffice, and for which opioid medication is appropriate. The extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of pain severe enough to require continuous (24 hours per day), long-term opioid treatment, and for which there are no alternative options to treat the pain. The oxycodone to morphine dose equivalent ratio is approximately 1 to 1.5 for immediate-release and 1 to 2 for extended-release formulations. Tramadol -\u00a0Tramadol is an FDA-approved medication for pain relief. It has specific indications for moderate to severe pain. It is considered a class IV drug by the FDA. Due to possible abuse and addiction potential, limitations to its use should be for pain that is refractive to other pain medication, such as non-opioid pain medication. There are two forms of tramadol: extended-release and immediate release. The immediate release is not for use as an \"as needed\" medication; instead, it is for pain of less than a week duration. For pain lasting more than a week, extended-release is the therapeutic choice \u2014 the indication for extended-release is for pain control under 24-hour management or an extended period. Off-label, the drug is useful for premature ejaculation and restless leg syndrome refractory to other medications. For the off-label use of tramadol for premature ejaculation, both sporadic and daily use is effective for treating the condition. Patients indicate a preference for \"as needed\" therapy for premature ejaculation due to the lack of side effects compared to the daily use of tramadol. Addiction, Dependence, and Tolerance While each of these terms is similar, providers should be aware of the differences. Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences. Pseudoaddiction - constant fear of being in pain, hypervigilance; usually, there is a resolution with pain resolution. Dependence - physical adaptation to a medication where it is necessary for normal function and withdrawal occurs with lack of the medication. Tolerance - lack of expected response to a medication increasing dose to achieve the same pain relief resulting from CNS adaptation to the medication over time. Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and will integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.\u00a0 As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if permitted by applicable state law, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers who were registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed on the part of registrants. There are no longer any limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine.

            "title": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), pain and aging: Adjusting prescription to patient features.",
            "abstract": "A narrative review of papers published from January 2011 to December 2021, after a literature search in selected databases using the terms \"pharmacokinetics\", \"ibuprofen\", \"diclofenac\", \"acemetacin\", \"naproxen\", \"etodolac\" and \"etoricoxib\" was performed. From 828 articles identified, only eight met the inclusion criteria. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with higher cardiovascular risk, while non-selective COX inhibitors are associated with higher gastrointestinal risk. NSAIDs with lower renal excretion with phase 2 metabolism are less likely to induce adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Patients with frequent NSAID use needs, such as elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular disease or impaired renal function, will benefit from lower renal excretion (e.g. acemethacin, diclofenac, and etodolac) (level of evidence 3). Polymedicated patients, elderly patients, and patients with chronic alcohol abuse will be at a lower risk for adverse effects with NSAIDs that undergo phase 2 liver biotransformation, namely, acemethacin and diclofenac (level of evidence 3). Young patients, patients dealing with acute pain, or with active and/or chronic symptomatic gastritis, selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib or etoricoxib) may be a better option (level of evidence 2). Knowing the individual characteristics of the patients, combined with knowledge on basic pharmacology, offers greater safety and better adherence to therapy. PERSPECTIVE: Although there are several NSAIDs options to treat pain, physicians usually take special care to its prescription regarding cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, despite the age of the patient. In this paper, based on the best evidence, the authors present a review of the safest NSAIDs to use in the elderly."

            "title": "Therapeutic potential of opioid/cannabinoid combinations in humans: Review of the evidence.",
            "abstract": "The endogenous opioid and cannabinoid receptor systems are widely distributed and co-localized throughout central and peripheral nervous system regions. A large body of preclinical evidence suggests that there are functional interactions between these two systems that may be leveraged to address various health conditions. Numerous animal studies have shown that cannabinoid agonists (e.g., delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [\u03949-THC]) enhance the analgesic effects of \u00b5-opioid analgesics as evidenced by decreasing the opioid dose required for analgesia (i.e., opioid sparing) and extending the duration of the opioid analgesia. In contrast, controlled human laboratory studies and clinical trials have not demonstrated robust analgesic or opioid-sparing effects from opioid-cannabinoid combinations. Meta-analyses of the literature (clinical trials, controlled laboratory studies; some non-controlled studies/case reports) have examined the effects of cannabis/cannabinoids for pain relief in those taking a wide variety of analgesics, including prescription opioid medications. These data do not strongly support the use of cannabinoids for chronic pain nor do prospective studies demonstrate significant cannabinoid-mediated opioid-sparing effects. Preclinical studies have also suggested a role for cannabinoids for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. Controlled laboratory and clinical studies suggest that there may be a modest signal for \u03949-THC to suppress some opioid signs and symptoms but they are not completely ameliorated and there may also be concerns around safety of \u03949-THC administration in a state of heightened autonomic arousal as occurs with opioid withdrawal. Despite anecdotal and correlational reports suggesting a benefit of cannabis on reducing opioid overdose, there is no strong data supporting this contention and emerging reports have conflicting results. In summary, there is a groundswell of public advocacy supporting the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to replace opioid analgesics or to reduce opioid use; however, the extant controlled clinical data do not support the role of cannabinoids for opioid replacement or opioid-sparing effects when treating opioid use disorder or chronic pain."

            "title": "Use of analgesics in France, following dextropropoxyphene withdrawal.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2009, the European Medicines Agency recommended withdrawal of dextropropoxyphene (DXP); in March 2011 it was withdrawn from the market in France. Up until that time the combination dextropropoxyphene-paracetamol (DXP/PC) was widely used for analgesia. At withdrawal, French regulators recommended that DXP/PC be replaced by other step 2 analgesics, i.e. tramadol, codeine, or opium-containing drugs, or by PC for a weak level of pain. To investigate prescribing behaviours after DXP/PC withdrawal, dispensations of analgesics before and after withdrawal were analysed.\nMETHODS: Aggregated dispensation data of analgesics prescribed between January 2009 and December 2012 in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region were obtained from the general health insurance claims data; changes in analgesic dispensation over time were analysed with the ATC/DDD methodology. Pre (Jan-June 2009) and post-withdrawal (Jan-June 2012) changes of DDDs where computed for each analgesic step.\nRESULTS: The dispensations of DXP/PC experienced a two-step decrease until 2011. Over the withdrawal period 2009-2012, there was a 14% decrease in the overall use of analgesic (from 109 to 94 DDDs), while the use of step 2 analgesics declined by 46% (-\u200922 DDDs, from 47 to 25 DDDs). This latter decline included a cessation of use of DXP/PC (29 DDDs in 2009) that were only in part (+\u20097 DDDs, from 18 to 25 DDDs) compensated by increased use of codeine, tramadol and opium, in monotherapy or combined with PC. For step 1 analgesics, use increased with 9%, mostly PC (+\u20098 DDDs, from 31 to 39 DDDs). Step 3 analgesics dispensations remained largely unchanged over this period (around 3 DDDs).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, DXP/PC withdrawal was accompanied in part by an increased use of same level analgesics, and in part by an increased use of PC in monotherapy. The extent of DXP/PC use before withdrawal, and the increased use of PC after DXP withdrawal, underline the complexity of pain management."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute periradicular abscess is a condition characterized by the formation and propagation of pus in the periapical tissues and generally associated with debilitating pain.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the overall analgesic effectiveness of two combinations of opioid and non-opioid analgesics for acute periradicular abscess.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 26 patients who sought emergency care in a Brazilian dental school. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: Co/Ac - oral prescription of codeine (30 mg) plus acetaminophen (500 mg), every 4 h, for 3 days or Tr/Ac - oral prescription of tramadol hydrochloride (37.5 mg) plus acetaminophen (500 mg) on the same schedule. Two factors were evaluated: (1) pain scores recorded by the patients in a pain diary 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment, using the Visual Analogue Scale; and (2) the occurrence of adverse effects.\nRESULTS: In both groups, there was a reduction in pain scores over time. For the Co/Ac group, there was a significant reduction in the scores 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment (P<0.05). In the Tr/Ac group, the scores significantly decreased over time from time point 6 h (P<0.05). Comparing the pain at each time point, the groups were not significantly different (P>0.05), i.e., both treatments were effective in controlling pain caused by APA; however, the combination of Tr/Ac caused more adverse reactions as two patients had to stop using the medication.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that, considering both analgesic efficacy and safety, the combination of codeine and acetaminophen is more effective to control moderate to severe pain from acute periradicular abscesses."

            "title": "Supervised dosing with a long-acting opioid medication in the management of opioid dependence.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first-line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off-site consumption.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off-site consumption.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/).All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references on topic-related systematic reviews.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS: Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes.We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow-up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self-reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence).Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low-quality evidence), while in the cohort study all-cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person-years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27).No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid-related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Take-home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take-home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow-up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence."

            "title": "Improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: a randomized controlled trial.",
            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The use of opioid analgesics in the United States has significantly increased in recent years. However, there is minimal consensus on what discharge counseling should accompany these high-risk prescriptions and large variations in what is done in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dual-modality (written and spoken) literacy-appropriate educational strategy on patients' knowledge of and safe use of opioid analgesics.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive discharged patients at an urban academic ED (>88,000 visits) with new prescriptions for hydrocodone-acetaminophen were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care or the educational intervention. The educational intervention was a one-page information sheet about hydrocodone-acetaminophen, which was both given to the patients and read aloud by the research assistant (nonblinded). Follow-up phone calls were conducted 4 to 7 days after the visit to assess patient knowledge about the medication and self-report of activities associated with safety of use (e.g., double-dipping with acetaminophen, storage, use with alcohol or while driving).\nRESULTS: A total of 274 patients were enrolled; 210 completed follow-up (110 usual care and 100 intervention). No significant differences in baseline characteristics emerged between the study arms; 42% were male, and 51% were white, with a median age of 43 years. Half of patients had non-back pain orthopedic injuries (49.5%). On follow-up, overall knowledge was poor, with only 28% able to name both active ingredients in the medication. The intervention group had better knowledge of precautions related to taking additional acetaminophen (usual care 18.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.9% to 25.5% vs. intervention 38%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 47.7%; difference = 27.6, 95% CI of difference = 21.5 to 33.7) and knowledge of side effects (usual care median = 1, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 2 vs. intervention median = 2, IQR = 1 to 2; p < 0.0001). Additionally, those who received the intervention were less likely to have reported driving within 6 hours after taking hydrocodone (usual care 13.6%, 95% CI = 7.2% to 20% vs. intervention 3%, 95% CI = -0.3% to 6.3%; difference = 10.6, 95% CI of difference = 3.4 to 17.9). There was no difference between groups related to knowledge about drinking alcohol while taking hydrocodone (overall 18.1%) or knowledge that the opioid could be addictive (overall 72.4%).\nCONCLUSIONS: This simple strategy improved several, but not all, aspects of patient knowledge and resulted in fewer patients in the intervention arm driving while taking hydrocodone. Integration of a patient education document into conversations about opioids holds promise for improving patient knowledge about these high-risk medications."

            "title": "[Tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets].",
            "abstract": "Tramadol/acetaminophen fixed-dose combination tablets (Tramse) combine tramadol, a centrally acting week opioid analgesic, with low-dose acetaminophen. The action of tramadol may be described as a weak agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake. The second component in these tablets, acetaminophen mainly appears to act through central mechanism. Chronic pain may be broadly classified into nociceptive, neuropathic and mixed. Tramset may exert additive or synergic benefits in treating the multiple mechanism of pain. Clinical studies have revealed its efficacy and safety for a variety of pain condition such as chronic low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It is expected that Tramset is going to induce pain relief and to improve disturbance of daily life in patients with intractable chronic pain. However overuse of Tramset may induce severe adverse effects such as addiction, abuse and hepatotoxicity. Therefore clinician should continuously assess pain intensity, activity of daily life, mode of its consumption, and adverse effects after prescription."

            "title": "Topical review on the abuse and misuse potential of tramadol and tilidine in Germany.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tramadol and tilidine (in combination with naloxone) are used as weak opioid analgesics in Germany. Tramadol is not scheduled in the German Narcotic Drugs Act. Tilidine is scheduled, whereas Tilidine in fixed combinations with naloxone is exempt from some of the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs Act. Recent reports on misuse of both substances led to an evaluation of their potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency by the expert advisory committee established by the German Federal Government, resident at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.\nMETHODS: A subcommittee formulated key questions and identified available data sources for each of these questions. Additional information was solicited where necessary, including a survey among a panel of pharmacists, a survey in an addiction clinic, analysis of prescription patterns, and information from the boards of pharmacists of the federal states and the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\nRESULTS: Analgesic efficiency in the treatment of acute and chronic pain has been proven for both tramadol and tilidine/naloxone. For tramadol, high evidence has been confirmed in systematic reviews, and tramadol is listed in national and international guidelines on acute and chronic pain management. Animal and human studies found a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency for both substances. Information from 2 tramadol safety databases allowed calculation of the incidence of abuse or dependency as 0.21 and 0.12 cases per million defined daily dosages (DDDs), with lower incidences in recent years. For tilidine/naloxone, the incidence was calculated as 0.43 cases per million DDDs for oral solution and 0.18 for slow-release tablets. In an online survey among German pharmacies as well as in the reports from state pharmacy boards, fraud attempts were repeated more frequently with tilidine/naloxone than with tramadol in the last 2 years. The Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigations reported prescription fraud only with tilidine/naloxone and predominantly in the region of Berlin. Dependency on tramadol or tilidine/naloxone is reported only rarely from addiction counseling centers. One third of the patients surveyed in an addiction clinic reported experiences with tramadol or tilidine/naloxone, but mostly with duration of less than 4 weeks and with a medical prescription based on a reasonable indication. Also, occasional illegal use of opioid analgesics as a substitute of heroin was reported. An evaluation of pooled data from statutory health insurance companies found 2.5% of persons receiving at least 1 prescription of tramadol or the combination of tilidine and naloxone in 2009 (1.6% with tramadol and 1.0% with tilidine/naloxone). High usage with more than 180 DDDs per year was found in 8.6% of patients treated with tramadol and 17.2% of patients with tilidine/naloxone.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the subcommittee of the expert advisory committee found a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency for tramadol, and a low prevalence in clinical practice. Considerable less information is available for the combination of tilidine and naloxone. However, the cumulation of evidence indicated a higher risk of misuse, abuse, and dependency for tilidine/naloxone solution, but not for slow-release tablets."

            "title": "Respiratory effects of diazepam/methadone combination in rats: a study based on concentration/effect relationships.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methadone may cause respiratory depression and fatalities. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines in methadone-treated patients for chronic pain or as maintenance therapy for opiate abuse is common. However, the exact contribution of benzodiazepines to methadone-induced respiratory toxicity remains debatable.\nMETHODS: We investigated the respiratory effects of the combination diazepam (20mg/kg)/methadone (5mg/kg) in the rat, focusing on methadone concentration/effect relationships. Respiratory effects were studied using arterial blood gases and whole-body plethysmography. Plasma concentrations of both R- and S-methadone enantiomers were measured using high-performance liquid chiral chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. To clarify mechanisms of diazepam/methadone interaction, methadone metabolism was investigated in vitro using rat liver microsomes.\nRESULTS: Diazepam/methadone co-administration significantly increased methadone-related effects on inspiratory time (p<0.001) but did not significantly alter the other respiratory parameters when compared with methadone alone, despite significant increase in the area under the curve of plasma R-methadone concentrations measured during 240 min (p<0.05). Diazepam/methadone co-incubation with microsomes in vitro resulted in a significant inhibition of methadone metabolism (p<0.01), with 50%-inhibitory diazepam concentrations of 25.02 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcmol/L and 25.18 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcmol/L for R- and S-methadone, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: We concluded that co-administration of high-doses of diazepam and methadone in rats is not responsible for additional respiratory depression in comparison to methadone alone, despite significant metabolic interaction between the drugs. In humans, although our experimental data may suggest the relative safety of benzodiazepine/methadone co-prescription, physicians should remain cautious as other underlying conditions may enhance this drug-drug interaction."

A change was done from prior monotherapy at day 0 to TTFC dosed once a day, regardless in the evening or in the morning, without washout period. Active evaluation of systemic and local tolerability (adverse events), and efficacy. i.e., intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering was done at control 1 (day 30), control 2 (day 90) and control 3 (day 120).\nRESULTS: 40/155/170 patients (79/309/339 eyes) completed the study (120 days/ 90 days/baseline, respectfully). At control 1 excluded were patients with low tolerability (severe hyperemia (6 patients), discomfort (4), chest pain (1)) and non responders (IOP lowering less than 15% from baseline IOP or target IOP >18 mmHg (4 patients)). Mean IOP at control 1 was 15.92 +/- 1.85 mm Hg (21.66% reduction) for 155 patients (non responders excluded), at control 2 was for 155 patients 15.67 +/- 2.17 mm Hg (21.14% reduction), and at control 3 for 40 patients 16.28 +/- 1.59 mm Hg (19.86% reduction). At control 2 analysis of IOP reduction by 4 groups of previous monotherapy (timolol 0,5% (N = 33/66), latanoprost 0.005% (N = 49/98), betaxolol 0.5% (N = 30/60), and travoprost 0.004% (N = 43/85) was performed. 40 patients/79 eyes endured to control 3 (after day 90 free samples were not available for all patients). Analysis of IOP reduction by 4 groups of previous monotherapy medications was performed (timolol 0.5% (N = 7/14), latanoprost 0.005% (N = 14/28), betaxolol 0.5% (N = 7/14), travoprost 0.004% (N = 12/23)).\nCONCLUSIONS: Changing patients from prior monotherapy to TTFC can provide on average a further reduction in IOP, while demonstrating a favorable safety profile."

Respondents lived independently, used OTC drugs, and were responsible for their health care decisions. Conn's Self-Medication Practice Tool was used to assess symptoms the older adults were treating with OTC drugs; therapeutic categories of OTC drugs used; frequency of OTC drugs used; and the use of alcohol, prescription drugs, and caffeine. The respondents reported pain as the symptom most frequently self-treated with OTC drugs. Ninety percent of the respondents used pain medicine, and approximately two thirds (67%) of the respondents used at least one high blood pressure medicine. More than half of the respondents (59%) used caffeine daily, and 10% used alcohol. The researchers concluded that older adults might be unaware of the adverse risks associated with concurrent use of pain medicines, alcohol, high blood pressure drugs, and regular caffeine use. This makes it necessary for all nurses and other clinicians providing health care to older adults to intensify efforts to educate and guard these patients and ensure appropriate use of OTC drugs."

            "abstract": "Pain of multiple etiologies remains a substantial problem for many patients presenting in the clinical setting. Improved pain relief can be demonstrated, and adverse effects minimized, by multimodal analgesic combinations as the method to improve pain treatment. Substantial evidence supports combining analgesics for the management of pain and, in some instances, they have a heterogeneous pharmacologic sparing effect. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with demonstrated efficacy and safety are widely useful for pain management. However, work needs to continue to further explore which analgesics at which doses can be combined with a coanalgesic in a patient-specific manner to achieve additive, if not synergistic, multimodal pain relief with the fewest possible adverse consequences. Unsupervised consumption of over-the-counter drugs that contain acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen offers clinical challenges to both the patient and health care providers. Couple this often undisclosed over-the-counter medication consumption event with prescription medications, which many contain similar combination ingredients, and the potential for a therapeutic misadventure may precipitate. This article will address the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen independently and in combination with currently available prescription dosage forms with a focus on pharmacology, pharmacotherapeutics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, including drug interactions at the CYP450 system. Patient-specific cautions are presented for opiate/opioid combinations, codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and propoxyphene, and there is a discussion of COX I/COX II agents."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of prescribing of methadone tablets and syrup in South Australia by investigating overdose deaths of patients using prescribed methadone and non-patients using illegally obtained methadone.\nDESIGN: Surveillance study of deaths related to methadone overdose, 1984-1994.\nDATA SOURCES: Coroner's Office and the Therapeutic Goods Section of the South Australian Health Commission.\nRESULTS: Per capita prescription of methadone tablets for chronic pain in South Australia was the highest in Australia in 1994. A large increase in deaths, due mainly to methadone tablets prescribed for chronic pain, occurred in 1993-1994. Illegal diversion of methadone to non-patients was responsible for half of the deaths during these two years. Deaths from overdoses of methadone syrup prescribed in maintenance therapy for drug dependence declined from 1984 to 1994. The relative risk for patient deaths due to methadone tablets versus methadone syrup was estimated to be 7.29 (95% confidence limits, 2.15-31.48). Psychotropic drug combinations were present in 86% of deaths.\nCONCLUSION: The methadone syrup program for drug dependence remains relatively safe. Our data raise concerns about prescribing methadone tablets for chronic pain. Better prescriber education and accountability, patient assessment and supervision and advice to patients about concurrent use of alcohol and benzodiazepines are needed."

After switching from PCV13 to PCV10 in 2015-2016, Belgium switched back to PCV13 in 2019. Building on our systematic monitoring of childhood nasopharyngeal carriage since 2016, here, we analyze the serotypes of S. pneumoniae and other pathogens in children attending daycare centers (DCCs) from 2018 to 2021. From the period of 2018-2019 to 2020-2021, we included a total of 2,741 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children aged 6 to 30\u2009months. We identified S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus and conducted serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility assessments of S. pneumoniae strains using culture methods and real-time PCR. S. pneumoniae carriage was frequent and quite stable over the three study years. H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were more frequently carried than S. pneumoniae. Frequency of all PCV13-serotypes together among S. pneumoniae carriers decreased significantly from 19.4% in 2018-2019 to 9.9% in 2020-2021 (p\u2009&lt;\u2009.001), largely due to the decreased serotype 19A carriage.

The aim of this article on specialist knowledge is to provide an overview of evidence-based decision-making for optimal diagnosis and treatment of RAT based on current studies and the new S3 guideline on tonsillitis. The diagnosis of a new episode of acute tonsillitis / sore throat should always include a classification with a scoring system (Centor, McIssac, FeverPain score) to assess the likelihood of bacterial tonsillitis, mainly due to group A streptococci (GAS). In unclear cases, a point-of-care test (POCT) for a GAS smear is helpful. Accurate counting of episodes is important in patients with RAT, as the cumulative frequency is the most important marker for or against tonsil surgery to date. In addition, a specific quality of life questionnaire should be used for each episode. Conservative symptomatic treatment of an episode includes a combination of paracetamol and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If there is a high probability of bacterial tonsillitis, especially in high-risk patients, antibiotic treatment is initiated directly or by delayed prescription. Tonsillectomy is indicated and highly effective if the patient had \u22657 adequately treated episodes of RAT in the previous year or \u22655 such episodes in each of the previous two years or \u22653 such episodes in each of the previous three years. Whether a tonsillotomy is equivalent to a tonsillectomy in these cases will only be answered once the TOTO study has been completed. Standardized pain management is an essential part of the operation, as most patients are likely to experience severe postoperative pain. Nowadays, evidence-based treatment of patients with RAT is readily available."

            "abstract": "The association between psoriasis and streptococcal infection has been widely explored in both children and adults. However, the exact impact of Streptococcus pharyngeal infection on the course of psoriasis is not fully comprehended. This study explored the impact of Streptococcus pharyngeal infection on psoriasis and investigated the effectiveness of systemic antibiotic therapy in conjunction with standard topical treatment for psoriatic patients with concomitant streptococcal throat infection. The research involved 115 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis, clinically assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients with active streptococcal infection were administered adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy along with standard local treatment for psoriasis, while psoriasis patients without evidence of infection received the local topical treatment only. Streptococcal infections were more common in psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls. A group of psoriasis patients with active streptococcal throat infections, treated with antibiotics in addition to standard topical psoriasis therapy, did not show any difference in PASI score reduction compared to those without evidence of active infection. While our study did not show a statistically significant reduction in PASI scores in psoriasis patients with streptococcal throat infections treated with antibiotics, it highlights the complex interaction between infection and psoriasis. Larger studies with longer follow-up may better clarify this relationship, contributing to stronger evidence for or against the use of antibiotics in managing psoriasis triggered by streptococcal infections."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rapid and accurate detection of group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis allows for timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment. This is important to prevent empiric antibiotic overuse while simultaneously lowering the risk of post-infection sequelae. Timely treatment may also reduce forward transmission, which could prevent cases of devastating invasive infections. The need for timely and accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis has created an ideal environment for molecular diagnostic (MDx) testing. The high sensitivity of MDx tests mean no culture confirmation is required for negative results in most situations, and several MDx tests are approved for point-of-care (PoC) use. As such, MDx technology can lower the barriers to treatment in remote areas of high incidence, where resources are limited. We believe it is time for widespread adoption of MDx testing for GAS pharyngitis.\nAREAS COVERED: Here, we highlight the advantages of MDx GAS pharyngitis testing and discuss challenges to implementation - as well as solutions to these challenges.\nEXPERT OPINION: In the face of increased GAS-induced disease following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence supporting the clinical validity and cost-effectiveness of MDx testing for GAS pharyngitis continues to grow. Although hurdles to implementation exist, broad-based implementation of this technology is within practical reach."

            "abstract": "Nanoparticles, defined as particles ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers in size, are revolutionizing the approach to combating bacterial infections amid a backdrop of escalating antibiotic resistance. Bacterial infections remain a formidable global health challenge, causing millions of deaths annually and encompassing a spectrum from common illnesses like Strep throat to severe diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. The misuse of antibiotics has precipitated the rise of resistant strains like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), underscoring the critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Nanotechnology offers a promising avenue in this crisis. Nanoparticles possess unique physical and chemical properties that distinguish them from traditional antibiotics. Their high surface area to volume ratio, ability to be functionalized with various molecules, and distinctive optical, electronic, and magnetic characteristics enable them to exert potent antibacterial effects. Mechanisms include physical disruption of bacterial membranes, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and release of metal ions that disrupt bacterial metabolism. Moreover, nanoparticles penetrate biofilms and bacterial cell walls more effectively than conventional antibiotics and can be precisely targeted to minimize off-target effects. Crucially, nanoparticles mitigate the development of bacterial resistance by leveraging multiple simultaneous mechanisms of action, which make it challenging for bacteria to adapt through single genetic mutations. As research advances, nanotechnology holds immense promise in transforming antibacterial treatments, offering effective solutions that address current infections and combat antibiotic resistance globally. This review provides a comprehensive overview of nanoparticle applications in antibacterial therapies, highlighting their mechanisms, advantages over antibiotics, and future directions in healthcare innovation."

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of medical records from nine primary care centers in Poland. The study enrolled 1949 medical records of patients (children 67.4%, adults 32.6%). An infection of Streptococcus pyogenes, based on a rapid strep test, was diagnosed in 830 patients (42.6%). In the comprehensive study group of 1949 patients, 1054 (54.1%) were given antibiotics. Notably, 224 patients had a negative rapid strep test result but still received antibiotic treatment, underscoring the complexity of treatment decisions. The most commonly used antibiotics were oral penicillin V in 431 cases (41%) and amoxicillin in 219 cases (20.8%). We observed no significant difference between positive rapid strep test results and patients' sociodemographic data and comorbidities. The prevalence of GAS was 42.6% in the analyzed records of patients with pharyngitis, and 54.1% were prescribed antibiotics. Antibiotics were overprescribed for sore throats.

Bacterial biofilms are more resilient to antibiotic treatment, and new therapeutic strategies are needed to control biofilm-associated infections, such as recurrent pharyngotonsillitis. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus are two bacterial commensals used for their probiotic properties. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-biofilm properties of L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus cell-free supernatants (LPSN and LRSN, respectively) on S. pyogenes biofilms grown in vitro in supplemented minimal medium. When planktonic or biofilm S. pyogenes were exposed to LPSN or LRSN, S. pyogenes survival was reduced significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effect was more pronounced on preformed biofilms. Enzymatic digestion of LPSN and LRSN suggested that glycolipid compounds might cause the antimicrobial effect. In conclusion, this study indicates that L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus produce glycolipid bioactive compounds that reduce the viability of S. pyogenes in planktonic and biofilm cultures.IMPORTANCEStreptococcus pyogenes infections are a significant concern for populations at risk, such as children and the elderly, as non-invasive conditions such as impetigo and strep throat can lead to severe invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis. Despite its susceptibility to current antibiotics, the formation of biofilm by this pathogen decreases the efficacy of antibiotic treatment alone. The ability of commensal lactobacillus to kill S. pyogenes has been documented by previous studies using in vitro settings. The relevance of our study is in using a physiological setup and a more detailed understanding of the nature of the lactobacillus molecule affecting the viability of S. pyogenes. This additional knowledge will help for a better comprehension of the molecules' characteristics and kinetics, which in turn will facilitate new avenues of research for its translation to new therapies."

Clinical, sociodemographic and vaccination histories were recorded. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and processed at Infectious Disease Research Laboratory, Aga Khan University, Karachi. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the culture positive isolates.\nRESULTS: Of the 200 children enrolled, pneumococcus was detected in 140(70 %) isolates. Majority of age-eligible children (60.1 %,110/183) received 3 PCV13 doses. PCV10 carriage declined from 13.2 %(78/590) in 2017/18 to 7.2 % (10/140) in 2022, additional PCV13 serotypes (3, 6A/6C and 19A) decreased from 18.5 %(109/590) to 11.4 %(16/140) while non-PCV13 serotypes increased from 68.3 %(403/590) to 81.4 %(114/140).

Studies using confocal and electron microscopy demonstrated that during the transfer of Tn916-related elements in nasopharyngeal cell biofilms, pneumococcal strains formed clusters facilitating their acquisition of resistance determinants at a high recombination frequency (rF). Remarkably, these aggregates comprise both encapsulated and nonencapsulated pneumococci that span extracellular and intracellular compartments. rF assessments showed similar rates regardless Mega was associated with large integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) (>23\u202fkb) or not (\u223c5.4\u202fkb). The rF for Mega Class IV(c) insertion region (\u223c53\u202fkb) was three orders of magnitude higher than the transformation of the capsule locus. Metabolomics studies of the microenvironment created by colonization of human nasopharyngeal cells revealed a link between the acquisition of ICEs and the pathways involving nicotinic acid and sucrose.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal clusters, both extracellular and intracellular, facilitate macrolide resistance acquisition, and ICEs were acquired at a higher frequency than the capsule locus.

In this cross-sectional study, we examined changes within the pneumococcal population following introduction of PCV13 in 2015 in the National Immunization Program (NIP), in Portugal. In 2018-2020 (NIP-PCV13), we obtained 1450 nasopharyngeal samples from children \u22646\u00a0years attending day-care. We assessed serotypes, antimicrobial resistance, and genotypes (MLST and GPSC) and compared findings with earlier periods: 2009-2010 (pre-PCV13), 2011-2012 (early-PCV13), and 2015-2016 (late-PCV13). Pneumococcal carriage prevalence remained stable at 60.2 %. Carriage of PCV13 serotypes was 10.7 %, markedly reduced compared to pre-PCV13 period (47.6 %). The most prevalent PCV13 serotypes were 19F, 3, and 19A all showing a significant decreasing trend compared to the pre-PCV13 period (from 7.1 % to 4.7 %, 10.1 % to 1.8 %, and 14.1 % to 1.8 %, respectively), a notable observation given the described limited effectiveness of PCV13 against serotype 3. Non-vaccinated children and children aged 4-6\u00a0years were more likely to carry PCV13 serotypes (2.5-fold, 95 %CI [1.1-5.6], and 2.9-fold, 95 %CI [1.3-6.8], respectively). The most prevalent non-PCV13 serotypes were 15B/C, 11A, 23B, 23A, and NT, collectively accounting for 51.9 % of all isolates. In total, 30.5 % of all pneumococci were potentially covered by PCV20. Resistance to penicillin (low-level) and macrolides increased significantly, from 9.3 % and 13.4 %, respectively, in the late-PCV13 period, to approximately 20 % each, mostly due to lineages expressing non-PCV13 serotypes, nearing pre-PCV13 levels. An expansion of lineages traditionally associated with PCV13 serotypes, like CC156-GPSC6 (serotype 14) and CC193-GPSC11 (serotype 19F), but now predominantly expressing non-PCV13 serotypes (11A, 15B/C, and 24F for GPSC6; and 15A and 21 for GPSC11) was noted. These findings indicate that the pneumococcal population is adapting to the pressures conferred by PCV13 and antimicrobial use and indicate the need to maintain close surveillance."

We characterized Streptococcus pneumoniae ( Spn ), Haemophilus influenzae ( Hflu ) and Moraxella catarrhalis ( Mcat ) in the nasopharynx during well-child healthy visits and at the onset of AOM, and in middle ear fluid (MEF) of children with AOM to assess anticipated effects of higher-valency PCVs (PCV15 and PCV20).\nMETHODS: From September 2021 to September 2023, we conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort study of PCV13 immunized children 6-36 months old. MEF was collected via tympanocentesis. Serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed on Spn , Hflu and Mcat isolates.\nRESULTS: We obtained 825 nasopharyngeal and 216 MEF samples from 301 children. The order of frequency of nasopharyngeal colonization was Mcat , Spn and Hflu ; Hflu was the predominant otopathogen in MEF. Among Spn isolates, non-PCV15, non-PCV20 serotypes predominated in the nasopharynx and in MEF; the most frequent serotype was 35B. Among MEF samples, 30% of Spn isolates were amoxicillin nonsusceptible; 23% of Hflu isolates and 100% of Mcat isolates were \u03b2-lactamase-producing.\nCONCLUSION: The majority of Spn isolates among young children were non-PCV15, non-PCV20 serotypes, especially serotype 35B; therefore, the impact of higher-valency PCVs in reducing pneumococcal colonization or AOM is expected to be limited. Hflu continues to be the most frequent AOM pathogen. Antibiotic susceptibility data suggest a high dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate or alternative drugs that are effective against contemporary mix of otopathogens could be considered for optimal empiric selection to provide the best efficacy."

This finding followed a marked decrease in the recording of patients with group A streptococcal infections and associated prescriptions during the period of covid-19 restrictions where the maximum count and rates were lower than any minimum rates before the covid-19 pandemic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Recording of rates of scarlet fever, sore throat or tonsillitis, and invasive group A streptococcal infections, and associated antibiotic prescribing, peaked in December 2022. Primary care data can supplement existing infectious disease surveillance through linkages with relevant prescribing data and detailed analysis of clinical and demographic subgroups."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012, Botswana introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) to its childhood immunization program in a 3+0 schedule, achieving coverage rates of above 90% by 2014. In other settings, PCV introduction has been followed by an increase in carriage or disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes, including some serotypes with a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance.\nMETHODS: We characterized the serotype epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of pneumococcal isolates cultured from nasopharyngeal samples collected from infants (\u226412 months) in southeastern Botswana between 2016 and 2019. Capsular serotyping was performed using the Quellung reaction. E-tests were used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations for common antibiotics.\nRESULTS: We cultured 264 pneumococcal isolates from samples collected from 150 infants. At the time of sample collection, 81% of infants had received at least one dose of PCV-13 and 53% had completed the three-dose series. PCV-13 serotypes accounted for 27% of isolates, with the most prevalent vaccine serotypes being 19F (n = 20, 8%), 19A (n = 16, 6%), and 6A (n = 10, 4%). The most frequently identified non-vaccine serotypes were 23B (n = 29, 11%), 21 (n = 12, 5%), and 16F (n = 11, 4%). Only three (1%) pneumococcal isolates were resistant to amoxicillin; however, we observed an increasing prevalence of penicillin resistance using the meningitis breakpoint (2016: 41%, 2019: 71%; Cochran-Armitage test for trend, p = 0.0003) and non-susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (2016: 55%, 2019: 79%; p = 0.04). Three (1%) isolates were multi-drug resistant.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCV-13 serotypes accounted for a substantial proportion of isolates colonizing infants in Botswana during a four-year period starting four years after vaccine introduction. A low prevalence of amoxicillin resistance supports its continued use as the first-line agent for non-meningeal pneumococcal infections. The observed increase in penicillin resistance at the meningitis breakpoint and the low prevalence of resistance to ceftriaxone supports use of third-generation cephalosporins for empirical treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis."

However, distinguishing GAS from viral pharyngitis is sometimes difficult. Unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to unwanted side effects, such as allergic reactions and diarrhea. It also may increase antibiotic resistance.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of a machine learning algorithm on the clinical evaluation of bacterial pharyngitis in children.\nMETHODS: We assessed 54 children aged 2-17 years who presented to a primary healthcare clinic with a sore throat and fever over 38\u00b0C from 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2022. All children were tested with a streptococcal rapid antigen detection test (RADT). If negative, a throat culture was performed. Children with a positive RADT or throat culture were considered GAS-positive and treated antibiotically for 10 days, as per guidelines. Children with negative RADT tests throat cultures were considered positive for viral pharyngitis. The children were allocated into two groups: Group A streptococcal pharyngitis (GAS-P) (n=36) and viral pharyngitis (n=18). All patients underwent a McIsaac score evaluation. A linear support vector machine algorithm was used for classification.\nRESULTS: The machine learning algorithm resulted in a positive predictive value of 80.6 % (27 of 36) for GAS-P infection. The false discovery rates for GAS-P infection were 19.4 % (7 of 36).\nCONCLUSIONS: Applying the machine-learning strategy resulted in a high positive predictive value for the detection of streptococcal pharyngitis and can contribute as a medical decision aid in the diagnosis and treatment of GAS-P."

We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal carriage, serotypes distribution, and antimicrobial profile of pneumococci among the children of Aden.\nMETHODOLOGY: A total of 385 children, aged 2-17 years, were included. Asymptomatic samples were randomly collected from children in selected schools and vaccination centers. Symptomatic samples were obtained from selected pediatric clinics. The nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for pneumococci using culture and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serotyping was done with a pneumotest-latex kit and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disc diffusion and Epsilometer test.\nRESULTS: The total pneumococcal carriage was 44.4% and 57.1% by culture and RT-PCR, respectively. There was a statistically significant association between carriage rate and living in single room (OR = 7.9; p = 0.00001), sharing a sleeping space (OR = 15.1; p = 0.00001), and low monthly income (OR = 2.02; p = 0.007). The common serotypes were 19, 1, 4, 5, 2, and 23. The proportion of non-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (non-PCV13) serotypes was 24%. Pneumococci were resistant to penicillin (96.5%), cefepime (15.8%), ceftriaxone (16.4%), and amoxicillin-clavulanate (0%). Erythromycin, azithromycin, and doxycycline had resistance rates of 48%, 31%, and 53.3%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: A high pneumococcal carriage rate was observed in Yemeni children, particularly in low-income households and shared living conditions. There was significant penicillin resistance at meningitis breakpoint. Furthermore, non-PCV13 serotypes were gradually replacing PCV13 serotypes. The findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced surveillance and stewardship to improve vaccination and antibiotic policies in Yemen."

In case of bacterial etiologies of the disease, penicillin antibiotics are prescribed, in particular amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. Dispersible forms of antibiotics have a number of advantages over film-coated tablets and are characterized by better pharmacokinetic parameters that increase the effectiveness and safety of treatment, as well as patient compliance.\nAIM: To compare the effectiveness and safety of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS in the form of dispersible tablets and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid in film-coated tablets in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized comparative clinical study involved 60 adult patients diagnosed with acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. Group 1 (n=30) received the Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS, dispersible tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. Group 2 (n=30) received Amoxiclav, film-coated tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. The duration of the treatment was 10 days. The following procedures were performed to all participants: general clinical and otorhinolaryngological examinations, an express test to detect group A streptococcal antigens in a smear from the posterior pharyngeal wall (streptatest), assessment of symptoms of acute tonsillopharyngitis on the McIsaac scale, severity of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, swelling of the throat, measurement of body temperature, assessment of the clinical global impression of the therapy, adherence to treatment, frequency of the adverse reactions before treatment, 3 days after the beginning of therapy and after the course completion (day 10).\nRESULTS: Recovery occurred in 96.6% of patients in group 1 according to examination on the 10th day of treatment and in 93.3% of patients in group 2. The rate of fever regression was higher in group 1 - on the 3rd day of treatment, normalization of temperature was observed in 36.6% and 30% of patients in the comparison group. Pain syndrome, symptoms of throat swelling and difficulty swallowing significantly (p&lt;0.01) regressed by the 10th day in patients of both treatment groups. The incidence of adverse reactions on the 10th day of treatment in group 1 was 10%, in group 2 - 33.3% (p=0.03).\nCONCLUSION: Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS has high therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, comparable to the Amoxiclav in film-coated tablets. At the same time, dispersible tablets of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS demonstrated a significantly higher safety profile compared to the simple tablet form."

The CAP-IT trial (grant No. 13/88/11; https://www.capitstudy.org.uk/ ) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from children discharged from hospitals with clinically diagnosed CAP, and found no differences in pneumococci susceptibility between higher and lower antibiotic doses and shorter and longer durations of oral amoxicillin treatment. Here, we studied in-depth the genomic epidemiology of pneumococcal (vaccine) serotypes and their antibiotic resistance profiles.\nMETHODS: Three-hundred and ninety pneumococci cultured from 1132 nasopharyngeal swabs from 718 children were whole-genome sequenced (Illumina) and tested for susceptibility to penicillin and amoxicillin. Genome heterogeneity analysis was performed using long-read sequenced isolates (PacBio, n\u2009=\u200910) and publicly available sequences.\nRESULTS: Among 390 unique pneumococcal isolates, serotypes 15B/C, 11\u00a0A, 15\u00a0A and 23B1 were most prevalent (n\u2009=\u2009145, 37.2%). PCV13 serotypes 3, 19A, and 19F were also identified (n\u2009=\u200925, 6.4%). STs associated with 19A and 19F demonstrated high genome variability, in contrast to serotype 3 (n\u2009=\u200913, 3.3%) that remained highly stable over a 20-year period. Non-susceptibility to penicillin (n\u2009=\u200961, 15.6%) and amoxicillin (n\u2009=\u200910, 2.6%) was low among the pneumococci analysed here and was independent of treatment dosage and duration. However, all 23B1 isolates (n\u2009=\u200927, 6.9%) were penicillin non-susceptible. This serotype was also identified in ST177, which is historically associated with the PCV13 serotype 19F and penicillin susceptibility, indicating a potential capsule-switch event.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that amoxicillin use does not drive pneumococcal serotype prevalence among children in the UK, and prompts consideration of PCVs with additional serotype coverage that are likely to further decrease CAP in this target population. Genotype 23B1 represents the convergence of a non-vaccine genotype with penicillin non-susceptibility and might provide a persistence strategy for ST types historically associated with vaccine serotypes. This highlights the need for continued genomic surveillance."

We identified a previously uncharacterized peptide in the Klebsiella pneumoniae secretome, which enters Streptococcus pneumoniae via its AmiA-AliA/AliB permease. Subsequent downregulation of genes for amino acid biosynthesis and peptide uptake was associated with reduction of pneumococcal growth in defined medium and human cerebrospinal fluid, irregular cell shape, decreased chain length and decreased genetic transformation. The bacteriostatic effect was specific to S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae with no effect on Streptococcus mitis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus or K. pneumoniae. Peptide sequence and length were crucial to growth suppression. The peptide reduced pneumococcal adherence to primary human airway epithelial cell cultures and colonization of rat nasopharynx, without toxicity. We identified a peptide with potential as a therapeutic for pneumococcal diseases suppressing growth of multiple clinical isolates, including antibiotic resistant strains, while avoiding bacterial lysis and dysbiosis."

The aim was to identify moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and SB thresholds for mortality risk.\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study comprised Australian participants aged\u2009\u2265\u200945\u00a0years with self-reported CHD (2006-2020). Self-reported MVPA (min/wk) and SB (hr/day) were the exposures. Cardiac and all-cause mortality were the main outcomes. Survival regression trees identified MVPA and SB thresholds influencing mortality survival rate. Cox regression models and the C-statistic were used to examine the thresholds, comparing them to public health guidelines.\nRESULTS: The cohort included 40,156 participants (mean (SD) age, 70.3(10.3) years; 15,278 females (38%)). During a median follow-up of 11.1 (IQR,6.2-14.4) years, 2,497 cardiac and 12,240 all-cause deaths were recorded. The threshold for MVPA and all-cause and cardiac mortality was\u2009\u2265\u2009146\u00a0min/wk and\u2009\u2265\u200996\u00a0min/wk, respectively.

All MVPA and SB thresholds had equivalent associated risk reductions and predictive abilities for cardiac and all-cause mortality to the public health guidelines.\nCONCLUSION: The newly identified thresholds suggest that the public health physical activity guidelines are suitable for reducing risks of all-cause mortality in people with CHD. For reducing risks of cardiac mortality, the threshold is suggested to be much lower. The SB suggested thresholds for reducing risks of mortality are 5-6\u00a0h/day. Further research is required to explore these thresholds and sex-specific differences."

Dynamic changes in vascular tone are determined, in large part, by the eNOS/NO/cGMP axis. We used pharmacologic gain of function of the eNOS/NO/cGMP axis in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and reduced function in lean mice to test the hypothesis that functionality of this vascular control mechanism parallels the benefits of an exercise training regimen. DIO mice have 50% lower exercise capacity (p<0.0001) than lean mice and were used for pharmacological gain of function. The PDE-5a inhibitor - sildenafil - increases cGMP and was administered to DIO mice daily. In sedentary mice, neither acute nor chronic sildenafil improves exercise capacity. In contrast, chronic Sildenafil synergizes with exercise training to improve performance during an incremental exercise test. Improved exercise performance was accompanied by a 40% increase in basal skeletal muscle capillary flow velocity and ~20% increase in plasma-perfused capillary density measured via intravital microscopy. Loss of function was tested in lean mice hemizygous for endothelial cell (EC) specific eNOS creating an EC-eNOS knockdown (KD). EC-eNOS KD decreases capillary density and exercise tolerance in sedentary mice; however, it did not prevent exercise-training induced improvements in endurance capacity. These data show that 1) increasing cGMP with sildenafil enhances microcirculatory function and exercise work tolerance that results from training; 2) eNOS KD does not prevent the microcirculatory or improvements in exercise tolerance with training. PDE-5a inhibitors combined with physical exercise are a potential mechanism for improving ambulation in patients with circulatory limitations."

This study investigates the effects of combined training (CT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on insulin sensitivity, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and serum levels of C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRP1 and CTRP3) in overweight and obese women.\nMETHODS: Thirty-three overweight and obese women (aged 18-50 years) were randomly divided into three groups: control (CON, n\u2009= 10), HIIT(n\u2009= 9), and combined training (CT, n\u2009= 10). The HIIT protocol consisted of intervals performed at 100% of maximum aerobic velocity (MAV) and rest intervals at 50% of MAV, with a 30-s work-to-rest ratio. The CT sessions included RT followed by AT. RT comprised seven exercises performed in three sets of 10-16 repetitions at 60-75% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). AT involved running for 15-30 min at 60-75% of heart rate reserve. Subjects trained three times per week.

These patients are considered eligible for exercise programs not only to improve prognosis related to their underlying heart disease but also to facilitate psychological adaptation to living with the device, to enhance evaluation of device performance and, particularly in ICD recipients, to reduce the risk of inappropriate shocks. Studies have shown that exercise training improves physical performance in CIED patients without increasing the risk of adverse events. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, a personalized exercise plan, appropriate device programming, and regular follow-up are essential to ensure that patients can safely engage in effective physical activity tailored to their specific needs. Participation in sports is another consideration for many CIED patients. Recent guidelines recommend encouraging individuals with CIEDs to engage in sports activities, unless contraindicated by their underlying heart conditions. It is generally accepted that low- to moderate-intensity leisure-time sports activities are safe and clinically beneficial for most individuals with a CIED. However, individualized recommendations may vary significantly depending on the patient's cardiovascular health, the impact of physical activity on their underlying disease, and the type of implanted device."

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular-Renal-Hepatic-Metabolic diseases are on the rise worldwide, creating major challenges for patient care and clinical research. Although these conditions share common mechanisms and often respond to similar treatments-such as lifestyle changes and newer cardiometabolic drugs (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists)-clinical management remains divided among multiple specialties. Recently proposed curricula in Cardiometabolic Medicine and Preventive Cardiology reflect an effort to address this fragmentation. In addition, recent studies reveal that hormonal deficiencies may increase cardiovascular risk and worsen heart failure, with emerging data showing that correcting these imbalances can improve exercise capacity and possibly reduce major cardiac events. To overcome gaps in care, we propose a new sub-specialty: Cardiovascular-Endocrine-Metabolic Medicine. This approach unifies three main pillars: (1) Lifestyle medicine, emphasizing nutrition, physical activity, and smoking cessation; (2) the Integrated Medical Management of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, early-stage kidney disease, metabolic-associated liver disease, and related conditions; and (3) hormonal therapies, focused on optimizing sex hormones and other endocrine pathways to benefit cardiometabolic health. By bridging cardiology, endocrinology, and metabolic medicine, this sub-specialty offers a more seamless framework for patient care, speeds up the adoption of new treatments, and sets the stage for innovative research-all critical steps in addressing the escalating cardiometabolic pandemic."

            "abstract": "None: Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide and the primary cause of mortality in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation is a complex, interprofessional intervention recommended for individuals with chronic cardiac conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure, and for those recovering from a recent\u00a0myocardial infarction\u00a0and procedures, such as coronary angioplasty\u00a0and coronary artery bypass grafting. Cardiac rehabilitation programs aim to reduce the psychological and physiological stress of cardiovascular disease, lower mortality risk, and enhance cardiovascular function to improve quality of life. Achieving these goals strengthens cardiac capacity, slows or reverses atherosclerotic disease progression, and boosts patient confidence through gradual conditioning. Cardiac rehabilitation, a key component of clinical practice guidelines, is an interprofessional program that focuses on supervised physical training, cardiovascular risk factor modification, and psychosocial support for individuals recovering from cardiovascular diseases. A standard 12-week program, typically consisting of 36 in-person sessions at a rehabilitation center, has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality while improving quality of life. However, only one-fourth of eligible patients participate, with factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location contributing to low enrollment.\u00a0In addition, many participants do not complete the full program, further limiting the benefits of this\u00a0cardiovascular health-enhancing strategy. Several organizations, including the American Heart Association, the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, emphasize that a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program should include core components designed to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction, reduce disability, promote healthy lifestyle changes, and support long-term adherence. Key focus areas include the following: Patient assessment. Nutritional counseling. Weight management. Blood pressure management. Lipid management. Diabetes mellitus\u00a0management. Tobacco cessation. Psychosocial support. Physical activity counseling. Exercise training ."

            "title": "Evaluating Heart Rate Variability as a Biomarker for Autonomic Function in Parkinson's Disease Rehabilitation: A Clustering-Based Analysis of Exercise-Induced Changes.",
            "abstract": "Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a key biomarker reflecting autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and neurocardiac regulation. Reduced HRV has been associated with cardiovascular risk, neurodegenerative disorders, and autonomic dysfunction. In Parkinson's disease (PD), HRV impairments indicate altered autonomic balance, which may be modifiable through structured exercise interventions. This study investigates the effects of aerobic exercise on HRV in patients with PD and evaluates autonomic adaptations to rehabilitation. Methods: A total of 110 patients with PD (55 male, 55 female) participated in a supervised three-month aerobic exercise program. HRV was assessed pre- and post-intervention using electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Time-domain and frequency-domain HRV metrics, including standard deviation of RR intervals (SDRR), very-low-frequency (VLF), low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF) power, and LF/HF ratio, were analyzed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques were applied to identify subgroups of HRV responders based on autonomic adaptation. Results: Significant improvements in HRV were observed post-intervention, with a reduction in LF/HF ratio (p &lt; 0.05), indicating improved autonomic balance. Cluster analysis identified four distinct HRV response subgroups: Strong Responders, Moderate Responders, Mixed/Irregular Responders, and Low Responders. These findings highlight individual variability in autonomic adaptations to exercise. PCA revealed that key HRV parameters contribute differently to autonomic regulation, emphasizing the complexity of HRV changes in PD rehabilitation. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that aerobic exercise induces beneficial autonomic adaptations in PD patients, as reflected by HRV changes. The identification of response subgroups suggests the need for personalized rehabilitation strategies to optimize autonomic function. Further research is warranted to explore the long-term impact of HRV-guided rehabilitation interventions in PD management."

It affects around 25% of adults and is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) composite, which considers cardiovascular health factors, has been studied for its predictive capacity in assessing arthritis risk. The study aims to provide tailored prevention recommendations and monitor factors associated with arthritis within the LE8 framework specifically for arthritic individuals.\nMETHODS: This population-based study used data from the U.S. NHANES (2017-2020) for adults aged 20\u2009+\u2009. Multivariate logistic and restricted cubic spline modeling explored the relationship between LE8 and arthritis, revealing significant nonlinearity (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\u00a0Gradient Boosting Decision Trees were\u00a0employed\u00a0to conduct a\u00a0predictive model of Arthritis risk.\nRESULTS: Through study, we found that idealer LE8 scores correlated with poorer arthritis risk. Subgroup analyses ideallighted poorer scores for smoking (P\u2009<\u20090.002, poor_socre and intermediate_score) and physical activity(P\u2009=\u20090.001, poor_score) as significant risk factors. Gradient Boosting Decision Trees predicted disease risk, with age, HDL cholesterol, and blood pressure identified as the three most significant predictive factors.\nCONCLUSION: The LE8 score in U.S. adults shows a negative association with arthritis outcomes, with arthritis prevalence decreasing as the score increases. poorer Smoke and Physical Exercise Time components and intermediate Blood Glucose scores may be arthritis risk factors. The LE8 may help identify arthritis risk early and reduce its burden."

We investigated the associations between genetic liability to sedentary behaviour and the incidence of the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nMETHODS: We constructed and validated a genome-wide polygenic score for leisure screen time (PGS LST) as a measure of genetic liability to sedentary behaviour. We performed survival analyses between higher PGS LST and register-based CVDs using the FinnGen cohort (N=293 250-333 012). Replication and exploratory analyses were conducted in an independent Norwegian Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT) cohort (N=35 289).\nRESULTS: In FinnGen, each SD increase in PGS LST was associated with a higher risk of incident CVD (HR: 1.05 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.06)) (168 770 cases over 17 101 133 person-years). The magnitudes of association for the three most common CVDs were 1.09 ((95% CI 1.08 to 1.09), 1.06 ((95% CI 1.05 to 1.07) and 1.05 ((95% CI 1.04 to 1.06) for hypertensive disease, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, respectively. Those in the top decile of PGS LST had 21%, 35%, 26% and 19% higher risk of any CVD, hypertensive disease, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, respectively, than those in the bottom decile. Associations were replicated in HUNT and remained independent of covariates (socioeconomic status, body mass index and smoking) except for cerebrovascular disease. Besides direct effects, reduced physical activity served as a potential mediating pathway for the observed associations.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that genetic liability to sedentary behaviour is associated with incident CVD, although effect sizes with current PGS remained small. These findings suggest that genetic liability to sedentary behaviour is an under-recognised driver of common CVDs."

People with cachexia experience unintentional weight loss, muscle loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, and reduced quality of life. Multimodal interventions which work synergistically to treat the syndrome could lead to benefits.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of multimodal interventions aimed at alleviating or stabilising cachexia in people with a chronic illness.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in July 2024, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with or at risk of cachexia, comparing multimodal interventions combining two or more modalities (of pharmacology, nutrition, exercise) to treatment as usual, variation of the intervention, or unimodal intervention.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB 1). Primary outcomes were physical function, strength, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were body composition and weight, quality of life (QoL), appetite, fatigue, and biochemical markers. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included nine studies with 926 adults (mean age: 63 years). Study sample sizes ranged from 20 to 332 participants. Six studies were conducted in Europe, and one each in Turkey, New Zealand, and the USA. There were six studies in people with cancer, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. We judged four studies to be at an overall high risk of bias, and five at an overall unclear risk. All outcomes in all comparisons had very low-certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias and/or indirectness and twice for imprecision. Multimodal intervention (pharmacological, nutritional, and/or exercise) compared to treatment as usual One cancer study randomised 46 participants, with 41 included in all analyses except adverse events. The study assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, lasting six weeks. Compared to treatment as usual, there is no clear evidence for an effect of a multimodal intervention on: physical function (mean difference (MD) -16.10 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -79.06 to 46.86; 41 participants); strength (MD 3.80 kg, 95% CI -3.21 to 10.81; 41 participants); adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.65; 46 participants); body composition (MD 7.89 cm2, 95% CI -10.43 to 26.21; 41 participants); weight (MD 5.89 kg, 95% CI -1.45 to 13.23; 41 participants); appetite (MD 0.68 points, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.96; 41 participants); fatigue (MD 0.12, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.29; 41 participants); and biochemical markers (MD 2%, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.01; 41 participants), but the evidence was very uncertain; QoL was not reported. Multimodal intervention compared to variation of the intervention Three cancer studies and one HIV/AIDS study randomised 192 participants. We could not use the available data, nor obtain additional data, from two studies (one in cancer, one in HIV/AIDS). The studies assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, ranging from three to seven months. Compared to a variation of the intervention, there is no clear evidence for an effect of a multimodal intervention on: physical function (MD 10.0 m, 95% CI -36.27 to 56.27; 1 study, 56 participants); strength (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI -3.75 to 5.15; 1 study, 56 participants); adverse events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.02; P = 0.75, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); body composition (MD -2.67 kg, 95% CI -5.89 to 0.54; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); weight (MD -2.47 kg, 95% CI -7.11 to 2.16; P = 0.30, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); QoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.26; P = 0.47, I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 95 participants); appetite (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.59; P = 0.48, I2 = 79%; 2 studies, 95 participants); fatigue (MD 6.40 points, 95% CI -1.10 to 13.90; 1 study, 56 participants); or biochemical markers (MD 9.80 pg/mL, 95% CI -6.25 to 25.85; P = 0.23, I2 = 73%; 2 studies, 95 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. Multimodal intervention compared to unimodal intervention We included six studies (802 participants) in this comparison: three cancer studies, and one each in people with COPD, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS. The studies assessed outcomes immediately after treatment, ranging from three to seven months. We could not use the available data, nor obtain additional data, from the HIV/AIDS study.

The certainty of the evidence was very low. Methodologically rigorous, well-powered RCTs with adequate interaction times are needed to assess the effectiveness of multimodal interventions in managing cachexia across chronic illnesses."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol with putative estrogen (E2) -like effects, is believed to counteract left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, how RES exerts its protection is not well understood, particularly when prominent risk factors, such as E2 depletion and pressure overload (PO), coexist. Here, we evaluated the impact of RES and E2 on angiogenesis and LVH in rats subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) and PO.\nMETHODS: Three weeks after bilateral OVX induction, abdominal aortic banding was performed on Wistar female rats to trigger PO. The animals were treated with either RES or E2 for six weeks. Finally, the heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW), cell size, fibrosis, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA expression were assessed. Angiogenesis was determined by evaluating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and protein expression and by CD31 immunostaining. Serum E2 levels were also measured.\nRESULTS: OVX\u00a0+\u00a0PO caused more severe myocardial hypertrophy (HW/BW) and fibrosis compared with PO alone, but did not aggravate cell size and ANP mRNA expression. OVX blunted the angiogenic response to PO, with reduced VEGF expression. RES increased VEGF expression and CD31, and abrogated LVH and fibrosis. E2 treatment improved VEGF expression and fibrosis, but not to the same extent as RES. RES improved serum levels of E2 in OVX\u00a0+\u00a0PO rats.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that RES limits OVX-induced exacerbation of LVH and fibrosis in a PO model, and targets systemic E2 levels and myocardial angiogenesis as underpinning protective mechanisms. Thus, RES may provide cardioprotection for post-menopausal women."

This study aimed to evaluate maximal aerobic capacity (peakVO<sub>2</sub>) in asymptomatic adults with LBBB without structural heart disease and compare it to an age-, physical activity-, and sex-matched control population.\nMETHODS: This prospective case-control study included asymptomatic adults with isolated LBBB and matched controls. All participants underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing and echocardiography. The primary outcome was to compare peakVO<sub>2</sub> and percent predicted peakVO<sub>2</sub> (pp-peakVO<sub>2</sub>) between LBBB and matched controls. Secondary outcomes included differences in left ventricular indexed end-diastolic volumes (iLVEDV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Multivariate linear mixed models were used to analyze primary and secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS: A total of 162 participants (81 with LBBB and 81 controls) were included. The mean age was 65.7\u00b110.2 years, and 106 participants (65.4%) were women. The mean pp-peakVO<sub>2</sub> and peakVO<sub>2</sub> were 93.6\u00b116.9% and 19.9\u00b16.4mL/kg/min, respectively. There were no significant differences in cardiovascular risk factors, NT-proBNP, or hemoglobin values between groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of LBBB was associated with lower peakVO<sub>2</sub> (-3.3mL/kg/min, 95%CI,-4.6 to-2.1; P &lt;.001) and pp-peakVO<sub>2</sub> (-17.2%; 95%CI, -22.1 to -11.9; P &lt;.001).

Apart from lifestyle intervention like exercise for high-risk groups or patients at early period, various medical interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have been clinically used to reduce progression and prevalence of CVDs. However, invasive surgery risk and severe complications still contribute to ventricular remodeling, even heart failure.

Currently, clinical translation of nanomedicines from bench to bedside continues to suffer unpredictable biosafety and orchestrated behavior mechanism, which, if appropriately addressed, might pave the way for their clinical implementation in the future. While state-of-the-art advances in CVDs nanomedicines are widely summarized in this review, the focus lies on urgent preclinical concerns and is transitioned to the ongoing clinical trials including stem cells-based, extracellular vesicles (EV)-based, gene, and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy whose clinically applicable potential in CVD therapy will hopefully provide first answers.

Angina is a common symptom in patients with CCS but remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Contemporary guidelines provide detailed information on diagnosing and treating angina based on evidence and expert consensus; however, their extensive nature may hinder uptake by non-specialists. This review presents a practical approach to diagnosing stable angina, followed by the three pillars of CCS management: 1) healthy lifestyle including appropriate exercise, diet, and avoiding toxic habits; 2) optimal medical therapy, including treatment recommended to prevent cardiovascular events and drugs for the control of myocardial ischemia and angina tailored to the patient's comorbidities; and 3) myocardial revascularization when indicated. This approach may be useful for practicing physicians but is not intended to substitute more detailed and authoritative documents. Checklists are proposed to help focus patient-physician interactions and make follow-up visits more efficient. This approach seeks to increase the proportion of correct angina diagnoses and patients receiving evidence-based treatments, emphasizing the importance of patient education, managing residual angina, and reducing cardiovascular risk.

            "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the efficacy of vitamin C for preventing and treating respiratory infections. Studies in a wide variety of animals have shown vitamin C to be protective against infections. In controlled trials in the general human population, vitamin C at a dose greater than 1 g/day did not prevent common colds. However, in 5 trials with participants undertaking heavy physical activity, vitamin C halved the incidence of colds. In 15 trials (n = 6244), regular supplementation of 1 g or more of vitamin C per day decreased the severity of colds by 15%. Results of therapeutic trials in which vitamin C was initiated after the onset of common cold symptoms have been inconsistent. However, 2 therapeutic trials found that 6-8 g/day of vitamin C was twice as effective at reducing the duration of colds as 3-4 g/day. In 3 controlled trials, vitamin C was shown to prevent pneumonia, but the contexts were atypical: the participants were schoolboys attending a boarding school in the United Kingdom before World War II, soldiers hospitalized for influenza A, and United States Marine recruits. It is unlikely that vitamin C would reduce the risk of pneumonia in the general population; however, 4 trials reported a treatment benefit for pneumonia patients, although the findings encourage further research rather than providing firm evidence of efficacy. Vitamin C has been tested for efficacy in COVID\u201119 and sepsis with conflicting results. Given the evidence that vitamin C reduces the severity and duration of the common cold, paired with its good safety profile and low cost, it is not unreasonable for patients to test whether therapeutic vitamin C supplementation at a dose of 6-8 g/day is beneficial at the individual level."

Although it is well known that a balanced diet which satisfies the daily intake of vitamin C positively affects the immune system and reduces susceptibility to infections, available data do not support the theory that oral vitamin C supplements boost immunity. No current clinical recommendations support the possibility of significantly decreasing the risk of respiratory infections by using high-dose supplements of vitamin C in a well-nourished general population. Only in restricted subgroups (e.g., athletes or the military) and in subjects with a low plasma vitamin C concentration a supplementation may be justified. Furthermore, in categories at high risk of infection (i.e., the obese, diabetics, the elderly, etc.), a vitamin C supplementation can modulate inflammation, with potential positive effects on immune response to infections. The impact of an extra oral intake of vitamin C on the duration of a cold and the prevention or treatment of pneumonia is still questioned, while, based on critical illness studies, vitamin C infusion has recently been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In this review, we focused on the effects of vitamin C on immune function, summarizing the most relevant studies from the prevention and treatment of common respiratory diseases to the use of vitamin C in critical illness conditions, with the aim of clarifying its potential application during an acute SARS-CoV2 infection."

The effect of vitamin C on preventing common cold in healthy adults has been investigated extensively, but not that of other micronutrients. Thus, we aim to assess the effects of providing micronutrients singly through oral means, on cold incidence, and/or management (in terms of cold duration and symptom severity) in healthy adults from systematically searched randomized controlled trials. From four electronic databases, 660 identified studies were screened and data were extracted from 20 studies (zinc, 10; vitamin D, 8; and vitamins A and E, 2). The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty in the outcomes was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days (when zinc is provided singly, 95% CI: -3.39, -1.12). This suggests that zinc supplementation may reduce the overall burden due to common cold among healthy adults."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Republic of Korea (ROK) military has a high incidence of respiratory diseases at training centres. Vitamin C has been reported to reduce the incidence of colds. For the purpose of preventing soldiers' respiratory diseases, this study aimed to investigate whether vitamin C intake can prevent common colds in the ROK Army soldiers.\nMETHODS: This was a randomised, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial of soldiers who enlisted in the Korea Army Training Centre for 30 days from 12 February to 13 March 2018. The study participants were divided into groups (vitamin C vs placebo). The military medical records were searched to determine whether the participants had a common cold. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the association between vitamin C intake and diagnosis of common colds. In addition, subgroup analysis on the relationship between vitamin C intake and common cold according to smoking status, training camp and physical rank was conducted.\nRESULTS: A total of 1444 participants were included in our study. Of these participants, 695 received vitamin C (6000\u2009mg/day, vitamin C group), while 749 participants received placebo (0\u2009mg/day, placebo group). The vitamin C group had a 0.80-fold lower risk of getting a common cold than did the placebo group. Subgroup analyses showed that this effect was stronger among subjects in camp A, among never smokers and among those in physical rank 3.\nCONCLUSION: Vitamin C intake provides evidence to suggest that reducing the common colds in Korean Army soldiers. Our results may serve as a basis for introducing military healthcare policies that can provide vitamin C supplementation for military personnel in basic military training."

            "abstract": "During the winter months, absenteeism or decreased productivity at work or school can often be attributed to symptoms of the common cold. Many people seek over-the-counter (OTC) products for their symptoms, and some of the commonly purchased products are those with high-dose supplements of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). The common cold causes enormous morbidity worldwide, and it is important to know the effects of vitamin C for both preventive and therapeutic purposes to correctly recommend the proper OTC product for these symptoms. The purpose of this article is to review the current data on the relationship between vitamin C and immune function, specifically, the utility of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of the common cold."

            "abstract": "The early indications of vitamin C deficiency are unremarkable (fatigue, malaise, depression) and may manifest as a reduced desire to be physically active; moreover, hypovitaminosis C may be associated with increased cold duration and severity. This study examined the impact of vitamin C on physical activity and respiratory tract infections during the peak of the cold season. Healthy non-smoking adult men (18-35 years; BMI < 34 kg/m2; plasma vitamin C < 45 \u00b5mol/L) received either 1000 mg of vitamin C daily (n = 15) or placebo (n = 13) in a randomized, double-blind, eight-week trial. All participants completed the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 daily and the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire weekly. In the final two weeks of the trial, the physical activity score rose modestly for the vitamin C group vs. placebo after adjusting for baseline values: +39.6% (95% CI [-4.5,83.7]; p = 0.10). The number of participants reporting cold episodes was 7 and 11 for the vitamin C and placebo groups respectively during the eight-week trial (RR = 0.55; 95% CI [0.33,0.94]; p = 0.04) and cold duration was reduced 59% in the vitamin C versus placebo groups (-3.2 days; 95% CI [-7.0,0.6]; p = 0.06). These data suggest measurable health advantages associated with vitamin C supplementation in a population with adequate-to-low vitamin C status."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for preventing and treating the common cold has been a subject of controversy for 70 years.\nOBJECTIVES: To find out whether vitamin C reduces the incidence, the duration or severity of the common cold when used either as a continuous regular supplementation every day or as a therapy at the onset of cold symptoms.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 11, MEDLINE (1966 to November week 3, 2012), EMBASE (1990 to November 2012), CINAHL (January 2010 to November 2012), LILACS (January 2010 to November 2012) and Web of Science (January 2010 to November 2012). We also searched the U.S. National Institutes of Health trials register and WHO ICTRP on 29 November 2012.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We excluded trials which used less than 0.2 g per day of vitamin C and trials without a placebo comparison. We restricted our review to placebo-controlled trials.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed 'incidence' of colds during regular supplementation as the proportion of participants experiencing one or more colds during the study period. 'Duration' was the mean number of days of illness of cold episodes.\nMAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants contributed to the meta-analysis on the risk ratio (RR) of developing a cold whilst taking vitamin C regularly over the study period. In the general community trials involving 10,708 participants, the pooled RR was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.00). Five trials involving a total of 598 marathon runners, skiers and soldiers on subarctic exercises yielded a pooled RR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64).Thirty-one comparisons examined the effect of regular vitamin C on common cold duration (9745 episodes). In adults the duration of colds was reduced by 8% (3% to 12%) and in children by 14% (7% to 21%). In children, 1 to 2 g/day vitamin C shortened colds by 18%. The severity of colds was also reduced by regular vitamin C administration.Seven comparisons examined the effect of therapeutic vitamin C (3249 episodes). No consistent effect of vitamin C was seen on the duration or severity of colds in the therapeutic trials.The majority of included trials were randomised, double-blind trials. The exclusion of trials that were either not randomised or not double-blind had no effect on the conclusions.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. Regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin C reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out. Nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them. Further therapeutic RCTs are warranted."

Ultraendurance athletes may not consume sufficient quantities or quality of food in their diet to meet these needs. Consequently, they may use oral vitamin and mineral supplements to maintain their health and performance. We assessed the vitamin and mineral intake of ultraendurance athletes in their regular diet, in addition to oral vitamin and mineral supplements. Thirty-seven ultraendurance triathletes (24 men and 13 women) completed a 7-day nutrition diary including a questionnaire to determine nutrition adequacy and supplement intake. Compared with dietary reference intakes for the general population, both male and female triathletes met or exceeded all except for vitamin D. In addition, female athletes consumed slightly less than the recommended daily intake for folate and potassium; however, the difference was trivial. Over 60% of the athletes reported using vitamin supplements, of which vitamin C (97.5%), vitamin E (78.3%), and multivitamins (52.2%) were the most commonly used supplements. Almost half (47.8%) the athletes who used supplements did so to prevent or reduce cold symptoms. Only 1 athlete used supplements on formal medical advice. Vitamin C and E supplementation was common in ultraendurance triathletes, despite no evidence of dietary deficiency in these 2 vitamins."

It is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains. Therefore, the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains. Moreover, the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain. Therefore, a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics. In this review we have addressed this problem and reviewed the published studies on ascorbic acid in the common cold and influenza and laboratory studies on the effect of ascorbic acid on influenza virus. We have also correlated the clinical and laboratory studies and developed a hypothesis to prevent influenza pandemics."

            "abstract": "The immune system is strongly influenced by the intake of nutrients. For a long time there has been a controversy whether vitamin C can contribute to the prevention and therapy of the common cold. Several cells of the immune system can indeed accumulate vitamin C and need the vitamin to perform their task, especially phagocytes and t-cells. Thus a vitamin C deficiency results in a reduced resistance against certain pathogens whilst a higher supply enhances several immune system parameters. With regard to the common cold different studies including meta-analyses underline that the prophylactic intake of vitamin C may slightly reduce the duration of the illness in healthy persons but does not affect its incidence and severity. Supplementation of vitamin C is most effective in cases of physical strain or insufficient intake of the vitamin. With regard to the therapy of the common cold the application of vitamin C alone is without clinical effects."

            "abstract": "Vitamin C concentrations in the plasma and leukocytes rapidly decline during infections and stress. Supplementation of vitamin C was found to improve components of the human immune system such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Vitamin C contributes to maintaining the redox integrity of cells and thereby protects them against reactive oxygen species generated during the respiratory burst and in the inflammatory response. Likewise, zinc undernutrition or deficiency was shown to impair cellular mediators of innate immunity such as phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity, and the generation of oxidative burst. Therefore, both nutrients play important roles in immune function and the modulation of host resistance to infectious agents, reducing the risk, severity, and duration of infectious diseases. This is of special importance in populations in which insufficient intake of these nutrients is prevalent. In the developing world, this is the case in low- and middle-income countries, but also in subpopulations in industrialized countries, e.g. in the elderly. A large number of randomized controlled intervention trials with intakes of up to 1 g of vitamin C and up to 30 mg of zinc are available. These trials document that adequate intakes of vitamin C and zinc ameliorate symptoms and shorten the duration of respiratory tract infections including the common cold. Furthermore, vitamin C and zinc reduce the incidence and improve the outcome of pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea infections, especially in children in developing countries."

Of the 439 eligible subjects, 144 and 161 were assigned to receive 50 or 500 mg of vitamin C, respectively, after protocol amendment. During the supplementation phase, 61 dropped out, and 244 completed the trial.\nINTERVENTION: Daily vitamin C supplementation of 50 mg (low-dose group) or 500 mg (high-dose group).\nRESULTS: Total number of common colds (per 1000 person-months) was 21.3 and 17.1 for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. After adjustment for several factors, the relative risks (95% confidence interval (CI)) of suffering from a common cold three or more times during the survey period was 0.34 (0.12-0.97) for the high-dose group. No apparent reduction was seen for the severity and duration of the common cold.\nCONCLUSION: A randomized, controlled 5-year trial suggests that vitamin C supplementation significantly reduces the frequency of the common cold but had no apparent effect on the duration or severity of the common cold.

Dietary vitamins C and E and beta-carotene had no meaningful association with common cold incidence. Long-term vitamin E and beta-carotene supplementation had no overall effect.Among subjects 65 years of age or older, the incidence of colds was slightly lower in the vitamin E group (RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.90-1.00); this reduction was greatest among older city dwellers who smoked fewer than 15 cigarettes per day (RR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.62-0.83).

There have also been a number of efforts to synthesize and/or overview the results of these trials, and controversy over what these overviews tell us.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to answer the following two questions: (1) Does regular high dosage supplementation with vitamin C reduce the incidence of colds? (2) Does taking vitamin C in high doses at the onset of a cold have a therapeutic effect?\nSEARCH STRATEGY: This review currently deals only with published trials from two previously published reviews by Kleijnen 1989 and Hemila 1992.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and non-randomised trials of vitamin C taken to prevent or treat the common cold.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.\nMAIN RESULTS: Thirty trials were included. The quality of the included trials was variable. Vitamin C in doses as high as one gram daily for several winter months, had no consistent beneficial effect on incidence of the common cold. For both preventive and therapeutic trials, there was a consistently beneficial but generally modest therapeutic effect on duration of cold symptoms. This effect was variable, ranging from -0.07% to a 39% reduction in symptom days. The weighted difference across all of the studies revealed a reduction of a little less than half a symptom day per cold episode, representing an 8% to 9% reduction in symptom days. There was no clear indication of the relative benefits of different regimes or vitamin C doses. However in trials that tested vitamin C after cold symptoms occurred, there was some evidence that a large dose produced greater benefits than lower doses.\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Long term daily supplementation with vitamin C in large doses daily does not appear to prevent colds. There appears to be a modest benefit in reducing duration of cold symptoms from ingestion of relatively high doses of vitamin C. The relation of dose to therapeutic benefit needs further exploration."

No effect on common cold incidence was observed in the six largest studies, indicating that vitamin C has no preventive effects in normally nourished subjects in the Western countries. There are, however, smaller studies reporting benefit. In three trials of subjects under heavy acute physical stress, common cold incidence decreased by on average 50%, and in four trials of British males common cold incidence decreased by on average 30% in the vitamin C groups. The dietary vitamin C intake in the UK is low, and consequently the benefit may be due to the correction of marginal deficiency, rather than high vitamin doses. Regular vitamin C supplementation (> or =1 g/day) has quite consistently reduced the duration of colds, but the size of the benefit has varied greatly. In the four largest studies the duration of colds was reduced only by 5%. In two of these studies, however, absence from school and work was reduced by 14-21% per episode, which may have practical importance. Three controlled studies recorded a reduction of at least 80% in the incidence of pneumonia in the vitamin C group, and one randomised trial reported substantial treatment benefit from vitamin C in elderly UK patients hospitalized with pneumonia or bronchitis. It seems that the preventive effects of supplementation are mainly limited to subjects with low dietary vitamin C intake, but therapeutic effects may occur in wider population groups. Further carefully designed trials are needed to explore the effects of vitamin C."

His quantitative conclusions were based on a single placebo-controlled trial on schoolchildren in a skiing camp in the Swiss Alps, in which a significant decrease in common cold incidence and duration in the group administered 1 g/day of vitamin C was found. As children in a skiing camp are not a representative sample of the general population, Pauling's extrapolation to the population at large was too bold, erring as to the magnitude of the effect. Nevertheless, Pauling's general conclusion that vitamin C has physiological effects on the common cold is of major importance as it conflicts with the prevailing consensus that the only physiological effect of vitamin C on human beings is to prevent scurvy."

In the present study the six largest vitamin C supplementation (> or = 1 g/d) studies, including over 5000 episodes in all, have been analysed, and it is shown that common cold incidence is not reduced in the vitamin C-supplemented groups compared with the placebo groups (pooled rate ratio (RR) 0.99; 95% CI 0.93, 1.04). Consequently these six major studies give no evidence that high-dose vitamin C supplementation decreases common cold incidence in ordinary people. Nevertheless, the analysis was continued with the hypothesis that vitamin C intake may affect common cold susceptibility in specific groups of people. It was assumed that the potential effect of supplementation might be most conspicuous in subjects with low dietary vitamin C intake. The average vitamin C intake has been rather low in the UK and plasma vitamin C concentrations are in general lower in males than in females. In four studies with British females vitamin C supplementation had no marked effect on common cold incidence (pooled RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86, 1.04). However, in four studies with British male schoolchildren and students a statistically highly significant reduction in common cold incidence was found in groups supplemented with vitamin C (pooled RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60, 0.81). Thus, these studies with British males indicate that vitamin C intake has physiological effects on susceptibility to common cold infections, although the effect seems quantitatively meaningful only in limited groups of people and is not very large."

Studies carried out since then have consistently found that vitamin C (> or = 1 g/d) alleviates common cold symptoms, indicating that the vitamin does indeed have physiologic effects on colds. However, widespread conviction that the vitamin has no proven effects on the common cold still remains. Three of the most influential reviews drawing this conclusion are considered in the present article. Two of them are cited in the current edition of the RDA nutritional recommendations as evidence that vitamin C is ineffective against colds. In this article, these three reviews are shown to contain serious inaccuracies and shortcomings, making them unreliable sources on the topic. The second purpose is to suggest possible conceptual reasons for the persistent resistance to the notion that vitamin C might have effects on colds.

These studies do not support a considerable decrease in the incidence of the common cold with supplemental vitamin C. However, vitamin C has consistently decreased the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms. The benefits that have been observed in different studies show a large variation and, therefore, the clinical significance may not be clearly inferred from them. The biochemical explanation for the benefits may be based on the antioxidant property of vitamin C. In an infection, phagocytic leucocytes become activated and they produce oxidizing compounds which are released from the cell. By reacting with these oxidants, vitamin C may decrease the inflammatory effects caused by them. Scurvy, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin C, is mostly attributed to the decreased synthesis of collagen. However, vitamin C also participates in several other reactions, such as the destruction of oxidizing substances. The common cold studies indicate that the amounts of vitamin C which safely protect from scurvy may still be too low to provide an efficient rate for other reactions, possibly antioxidant in nature, in infected people."

Personality, like cognition, changes with dementia, but no clinical trials to date have examined the effects of HT on personality traits. This study aimed to determine the effects of HT on personality traits in older men and women.\nMETHOD: Secondary data analysis was performed from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over studies of menopausal HT in women and testosterone therapy (TT) in men. Participants were community-dwelling cognitively normal adults (mean age = 75.2\u2009years), including 29 men and 22 women. Three months of hormone intervention (for women, 0.625\u2009mg/day conjugated equine estrogen with or without 2.5\u2009mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate; for men, 200\u2009mg intramuscular testosterone enanthate every 2\u2009weeks) were crossed over with 3\u2009months of identical placebo with a 3-month washout between intervention phases.

In how far the decline of testosterone production contributes to these problems in older men and whether testosterone therapy can contribute to slow down, prevent, or reverse their development remains subjects of debate.\nOBJECTIVES: This narrative review presents the current knowledge on association of sex steroid status with cognitive decline and impairment of physical function and mobility in elderly men and on the effects of testosterone therapy on cognition and on physical performance and mobility in elderly men.\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: The review is based on electronic database searches with primary focus on evidence from larger prospective observational studies and from controlled randomized trials, respectively.\nRESULTS: In most observational studies, testosterone levels do not predict cognitive decline or development of Alzheimer's disease. In randomized trials, testosterone therapy did not significantly affect cognition in men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone, regardless of whether they have preexisting cognitive impairment. Overall, observational data indicate that the usually moderate decline of androgen exposure in older men cannot fully account for the parallel decline of physical performance and mobility. Trials of testosterone therapy in older men with low or low-normal serum testosterone, whether they were generally healthy or suffered from physical function impairments, either did not show any effect on mobility and physical performance or showed limited effects of uncertain clinical relevancy.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The whole of the evidence tends to downplay the role of sex steroid status in the decline of cognitive function and impairment of physical function and mobility in older men. Based on the available evidence, prevention or treatment of cognitive decline or of impairment of mobility and physical function are not valid indications for testosterone treatment in older men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone levels."

This syndrome is diagnosed in men who, for no discernible reason other than older age, obesity or ill health have serum testosterone concentrations below the normal range for healthy young men and report one or more of the following symptoms: muscle weakness or wasting, mood, behaviour and cognition-related symptoms and sexual function or libido impairment. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that testosterone drugs do not substantially ameliorate these symptoms and, more worryingly, that their long-term use may be associated with severe adverse effects (i.e. increased risk of prostate cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction, worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and testicular atrophy). Nonetheless, testosterone drugs have exhibited extraordinary commercial success and their pharmaceutical sales are steadily rising. Behind this apparently unjustifiable trend there are deliberate, well designed direct and indirect pharmaceutical marketing initiatives that exploit the conviction rooted in contemporary society that testosterone can reverse the effects of ageing and ensure social accomplishment. Commercial mechanisms have laid the foundation for disease mongering of LOH and also have resulted a considerable expansion of the indications for treatment. This promotion model deserves particular attention since it is applicable to any drug with a purportedly favourable risk-benefit ratio not supported by evidence."

            "abstract": "Testosterone (T) levels decline as men age, but it is unclear whether this has an effect on cognition. Some studies indicate that lower T levels are associated with memory loss; thus, maintaining a higher T level could have positive effects on aspects of cognitive function. Concerns exist, however, about the effect of T therapy on the prostate in older men. We hypothesized that T replacement in older men with low T levels would improve aspects of cognitive function and that the addition of finasteride would not affect the T-induced cognitive improvements. Healthy men, 65 to 83 years of age, with baseline total T below 350 ng/dL and no evidence of cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 regimens: 200 mg of T every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection with placebo pill daily (T-only), 200 mg of T every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection with 5 mg of finasteride daily (T+F), or placebo injections and pills (placebo). Sixty-nine men completed baseline cognitive testing; 65 completed at least 4 months, and 46 completed all 36 months of the study. Participants were given a battery of cognitive evaluations at baseline, 4 months, and 36 months, along with measurement of serum hormone levels. Serum total T, bioavailable T, and estradiol levels in the T-only and T+F groups significantly increased throughout the treatment period, whereas these hormone levels did not change in the placebo group. Only minimally significant differences were seen among the 3 groups in any evaluation of cognitive performance, either in the short-term (4 months) or the long-term (36 months) analysis. These results indicate that T replacement, whether given alone or in combination with finasteride, for 36 months in healthy older men without cognitive impairment at baseline has no clinically significant effect on tests of cognitive function. Further studies are warranted to determine whether hormone replacement in men with preexisting cognitive impairment is beneficial."

            "abstract": "Despite nearly a half-century of research on aging and sex steroids in men, answers to key questions that would allow us to confidently assess risk:benefit ratios for androgen replacement in older men with the partial androgen deficiency of aging men (PADAM) syndrome remain uncertain. Although it is now reasonably clear that a significant percentage of otherwise healthy older men have decreases in testosterone and bioavailable testosterone to levels consistent with hypogonadism, the clinical implications of this change remain uncertain. Data suggest that low testosterone in older men is correlated to varying degrees with loss of lean body mass and muscle strength, and increased total and central body fat. Less certain, but suggestive, are data relating low testosterone levels to decreased bone density, loss of insulin sensitivity, and cognitive and affective deterioration, as well as reduced sexual function. Replacement of testosterone in older men has shown some positive effects on each of these variables, but findings have been inconsistent, perhaps because studies have employed different preparations and doses of androgens, treated for various durations, and defined their target populations in different ways. As important as beneficial effects is the potential for adverse effects, which may be greater in older men. Possible problems include sleep apnea, erythrocytosis, dyslipidemia with acceleration of atherosclerosis, and, of greatest concern, prostate cancer or hyperplasia. Studies to date have suggested that these outcomes are not major risks, but, in the absence of a large, randomized trial or trials, definitive information is not available. The US National Academies Institute of Medicine's recent report recommends that the National Institutes of Health support small efficacy trials aimed at treatment of androgen deficiency-related clinical conditions, but not a large, randomized trial to elucidate risk:benefit ratios. This recommendation, if adhered to, is likely to delay, rather than foster, progress in this important area."

            "abstract": "Serum testosterone levels decline gradually and progressively with aging in men. Many manifestations associated with aging in men, including muscle atrophy and weakness, osteoporosis, reduced sexual functioning, and increased fat mass, are similar to changes associated with testosterone deficiency in young men. These similarities suggest that testosterone supplementation may prevent or reverse the effects of aging. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify studies of testosterone supplementation therapy in older men. A structured, qualitative review was performed of placebo-controlled trials that included men aged 60 and older and evaluated one or more physical, cognitive, affective, functional, or quality-of-life outcomes. Studies focusing on patients with severe systemic diseases and hormone deficiencies related to specific diseases were excluded. In healthy older men with low-normal to mildly decreased testosterone levels, testosterone supplementation increased lean body mass and decreased fat mass. Upper and lower body strength, functional performance, sexual functioning, and mood were improved or unchanged with testosterone replacement. Variable effects on cognitive function were reported, with improvements in some cognitive domains (e.g., spatial, working, and verbal memory). Testosterone supplementation improved exercise-induced coronary ischemia in men with coronary heart disease, whereas angina pectoris was improved or unchanged. In a few studies, men with low testosterone levels were more likely to experience improvements in lumbar bone mineral density, self-perceived functional status, libido, erectile function, and exercise-induced coronary ischemia with testosterone replacement than men with less marked testosterone deficiency. No major unfavorable effects on lipids were reported, but hematocrit and prostate specific antigen levels often increased. Based on these results, testosterone supplementation cannot be recommended at this time for older men with normal or low-normal testosterone levels and no clinical manifestations of hypogonadism. However, testosterone replacement may be warranted in older men with markedly decreased testosterone levels, regardless of symptoms, and in men with mildly decreased testosterone levels and symptoms or signs suggesting hypogonadism. The long-term safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation remain uncertain. Establishment of evidence-based indications will depend on further demonstrations of favorable clinical outcomes and symptomatic, functional, and quality-of-life benefits in carefully performed, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mixed milk feeding is defined as providing formula and/or animal milk along with breast milk to infants under six months old which is prevalent in many countries. However, this practice is generally not recommended as it can reduce the intake of breast milk, depriving the infant of its optimal nutritional and immunological benefits. Unlike formula, breast milk contains complex bioactive constituents that promote intestinal and pancreatic growth and develop mucosal defenses. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution and predictors of MMF practices in Ethiopia.\nMETHODS: This study utilized data from the 2019 Mini-Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (MiniEDHS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from March to June 2019. The total weighted sample size derived from the data examined in this study amounted to 524 infants. The data analysis used Global Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation and the Getis-Ord Gi\u2009* statistic for local cluster analysis to assess the spatial distribution of mixed milk feeding prevalence across Ethiopia's administrative regions and cities. Empirical Bayesian Kriging was used for spatial interpolation to estimate mixed milk feeding prevalence in unsampled areas. The analysis utilized a maximum spatial cluster size threshold of 50% of the population to detect clusters of varying sizes. Ordinary least squares regression analysis identified significant spatial predictors. In geographically weighted regression analysis, the effect of predictor variables on the spatial variation of mixed milk feeding was detected using local coefficients.\nRESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence of Mixed Milk Feeding (MMF) in Ethiopia was 10.12% (95% CI: 7.8, 13.01). This prevalence shows significant regional variations across the country emphasizing regional disparities in prevalence and distribution. The Global Moran's I statistic was 0.14, with a Z-score of 3.18 and a p-value of <\u20090.001, indicating a significant spatial clustering of MMF prevalence. Hotspots of mixed milk feeding were identified in Somali, Dire Dawa, and Afar, while cold spots were observed in Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, SNNPR, and parts of Oromia. Household wealth (middle wealth index) and lack of baby postnatal checkups emerged as key influencers of mixed milk feeding practices.\nCONCLUSION: The study found significant regional variations in mixed milk feeding practices in Ethiopia. Households with middle wealth index and baby without postnatal check were significant spatial predictors of mixed milk feeding. To reduce mixed milk feeding prevalence, targeted interventions should engage community leaders, enhance breastfeeding education in maternal health services, and integrate counseling into routine healthcare to support informed maternal choices and improve child health outcomes nationwide."

However, the potential advantages of breastfeeding extend well beyond initial months. Breast milk adapts to the evolving needs of the growing infant, and its immunological, microbiological, and biochemical properties have been associated with enhanced protection against infections and chronic diseases, improved growth and development, and lower rates of hospitalization and mortality. This review explores the evidence supporting the continuation of breastfeeding beyond six months. More meticulous studies employing consistent methodologies and addressing confounders are essential. This will enable a more accurate determination of the extent and mechanisms of the positive impact of prolonged breastfeeding and allow for the implementation of effective public health strategies."

            "abstract": "Breastfeeding provides important immunological benefits to the neonate, but how the different immunoactive components in breastmilk contribute to immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized human breastmilk T cells using single-cell RNA-Seq and flow cytometry. Breastmilk contained predominantly memory T cells, with expression of immune signaling genes, high proliferation, and an effector Th1/cytotoxic profile with high cytokine production capacities. Elevated activation was balanced by an enriched Treg population and immune regulatory markers in conventional memory T cells. Gene and surface expression of tissue-residency markers indicate that breastmilk T cells represented tissue-adapted rather than circulatory T cells. In addition, breastmilk T cells had a broad homing profile and higher activation markers in these migratory subsets. The partly overlapping transcriptome profile between breastmilk and breast tissue T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells, might support a role in local immune defense in the mammary gland. However, unique features of breastmilk, such as Tregs, might imply an additional role in neonatal immune support. We found some correlations between the breastmilk T cell profile and clinical parameters, most notably with maternal and household factors. Together, our data suggest that breastmilk contains an adapted T cell population that exerts their function in specific tissue sites."

We investigated the effect of IPTp on infant growth in Uganda and its pathways of effects using causal mediation analyses.\nMETHODS: We analysed data from 633 infants born to mothers enrolled in a randomised trial of monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) vs. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (NCT02793622). Weight and length were measured from 0 to 12 months of age. Using generalised linear models, we estimated effects of DP vs. SP on gravidity-stratified mean length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ). We investigated mediation by placental malaria, gestational weight change, maternal anaemia, maternal inflammation-related proteins, preterm birth, birth length, and birth weight. Mediation models adjusted for infant sex, gravidity, gestational age at enrolment, maternal age, maternal parasitaemia at enrolment, education, and wealth.\nFINDINGS: SP increased mean LAZ by 0.18-0.28 Z from birth through age 4 months compared to DP, while DP increased mean WLZ by 0.11-0.28 Z from 2 to 8 months compared to SP among infants of multigravidae; at these ages, confidence intervals for mean differences excluded 0. We did not observe differences among primigravida. Mediators of SP included birth weight, birth length, maternal stem cell factor, and DNER. Mediators of DP included placental malaria and birth length, maternal IL-18, CDCP1, and CD6 at delivery.\nINTERPRETATION: In high malaria transmission settings, this exploratory study suggests different IPTp regimens may influence infant growth among multigravidae, potentially through distinct pathways, in the exclusive breastfeeding period, when few other interventions are available.\nFUNDING: Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

The objective of the study was to expand knowledge about breastfeeding and the degree of contribution of breast milk to the feeding of infants with IEM before and after the introduction of expanded newborn screening. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on 127 infants born between 1997 and 2020: 66 with phenylketonuria (PKU), 45 with other IEM (non-PKU), all diagnosed through newborn screening (NBS), and 16 non-PKU diagnosed through selective screening (SS). The time of initiation of dietary treatment and the proportion of breast milk in the diet, both expressed and breastfed, with or without intake control, were analysed at 1, 3, and 6 months after birth. For 47% of the newborns in Groups 1 and 2, the dietary treatment was started before the 10th day of life; in Group 3, the dietary treatment was started after the 10th day of life for all children. During the first month of life, the proportion of infants receiving breast milk was higher in the NBS-PKU (74%) and the NBS non-PKU (80%) groups, compared with 38% in the SS non-PKU infants. In the subsequent months of life, the proportion of infants receiving human milk (either from the breast or a bottle) declined in all groups. This decline occurred more in bottle-fed rather than directly breast-fed infants. Our observations indicate that the model of feeding from a bottle with expressed milk may have had an adverse effect on maintaining lactation and may have contributed to a faster transition to formula milk. Maintaining lactation and extending the period of feeding the infant with human milk in the first 6 months of life is possible by breastfeeding on demand, under regular biochemical monitoring: preferably weekly in PKU infants, and at least every 2-4 weeks in infants with other IEM."

Vitamin D levels during fetal and neonatal periods have a significant role in the development of the immunological system. The study aims to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and the risk of early-onset neonatal sepsis in full-term neonates in a developing country.\nMETHODS: This case-control study was conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) of Kasr Alainy Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. The study was composed of two groups; the sepsis group involved full-term neonates appropriate for gestational age with sepsis-related clinical signs. The control group included newborns with no signs of clinical/laboratory infection within 72\u00a0h of life. Blood samples were collected on admission during the first three days of life in both groups for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, Complete Blood Count (CBC), C reactive protein (CRP), and blood culture.\nRESULTS: Forty-five newborns with clinical and laboratory findings of early-onset neonatal sepsis within 72\u00a0h of life were enrolled, and the control group included forty-five newborns with no evidence of sepsis. Vitamin D levels in the sepsis group were significantly lower than in the control group. Apgar score at the first minute was significantly lower in the sepsis group. 57.8% of neonates with sepsis had positive blood cultures. There was a statistical difference between deficient, insufficient, and sufficient vitamin D levels regarding the duration of the NICU stay, which was longer in neonates with deficient vitamin D levels. CRP was significantly higher in neonates with deficient vitamin D levels. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for serum vitamin D in the prediction of neonatal sepsis was 0.76 at a cutoff\u2009<\u200919.7(ng/ml).\nCONCLUSION: In the current study, full-term newborns with EOS had considerably lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls.

The orchestration of emotional bonds relies on the interplay of oxytocin and prolactin, fundamental hormones that underpin maternal attachment, mitigate postpartum depression, and cultivate self-confidence. Simultaneously, breastfeeding promotes infant development by fostering robust brain growth, bolstering immune defenses, and nurturing cognitive and emotional maturation - all of which are nurtured through maternal interactions. We must respond to the call for heightened advocacy of breastfeeding. This entails delivering education, easily accessible support, and creating an environment where breastfeeding is normalized. By dispelling misconceptions and eradicating stigmatization associated with breastfeeding, we can amplify awareness and empower mothers to make well-informed decisions for their newborns. These implications reverberate extensively. Enhanced maternal mental well-being and self-assurance form the bedrock of healthier family dynamics. At the same time, the dividends of cognitive, emotional, and immunological enrichment in children represent a more promising future. At a societal level, the embrace and promotion of breastfeeding cultivate an environment that places immense value on the health and happiness of both mothers and children. This journey is more profound than mere sustenance; it signifies a complex web of advantages.

Regulatory authorities have approved the emergency use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to the rapid spread of the virus. However, during vaccination testing, pregnant and breastfeeding women were initially excluded, leading to a lack of evidence-based recommendations. When taking the COVID-19 pandemic into account, breastfeeding has emerged as a potential defense mechanism against this infection due to its numerous benefits for newborns. Human breast milk contains immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), lactoferrin, and various cells\u00a0that play an inevitable role in the newborn's protection against respiratory infections and immune system development. Various studies have highlighted that the onset and severity of respiratory infections in infants can be reduced through breastfeeding, and the effects are noticeable during the first six months of life and that breast milk also has the potential to enhance mucosal immunity and promote a diverse microbiome, reducing the risk of asthma, allergies, and enteric diseases through the provision of specific antibodies and immunological factors. Researchers have indicated that breastfeeding mothers who contracted and recovered from COVID-19 or received vaccination passed protective antibodies to their infants through breast milk. Although rare cases of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk have been reported, the virus has not been cultured from these samples, suggesting a low risk of transmission to the breastfed baby. However, further research is essential to understand the extent of protection provided by breast milk against COVID-19 and the potential effect of distinct phases of lactation. Nonetheless, the current evidence supports the benefits and safety of breastfeeding during the pandemic. With appropriate safety measures, promoting breastfeeding can contribute to the overall health and well-being of infants during the phase of COVID-19."

However, when breastfeeding is not possible, infant formula is the most appropriate alternative. Its composition meets the nutritional requirements of the infant, and its quality is subject to strict control by the authorities. Nonetheless, the presence of different pollutants has been detected in both matrices. Thus, the aim of the present review is to make a comparison between the findings in both breast milk and infant formula in terms of contaminants in the last decade, in order to choose the most convenient option depending on the environmental conditions. For that, the emerging pollutants including metals, chemical compounds derived from heat treatment, pharmaceutical drugs, mycotoxins, pesticides, packaging materials, and other contaminants were described. While in breast milk the most concerning contaminants found were metals and pesticides, in infant formula pollutants such as metals, mycotoxins, and packaging materials were the most outstanding. In conclusion, the convenience of using a feeding diet based on breast milk or either infant formula depends on the maternal environmental circumstances. However, it is important to take into account the immunological benefits of the breast milk compared to the infant formula, and the possibility of using breast milk in combination with infant formula when the nutritional requirements are not fulfilled only with the intake of breast milk. Therefore, more attention should be paid in terms of analyzing these conditions in each case to be able to make a proper decision, as it will vary depending on the maternal and newborn environment."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improved health outcomes for critically ill infants including neurodevelopmental, immunological, and cost benefits are dependent upon the dose and duration of mother's own milk feedings. However, mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) must express their milk (pump-dependent) and often struggle with milk production.\nPURPOSE: To examine the state of the science on nonpharmacologic modifiable expression factors that may influence milk production in pump-dependent mothers of critically ill infants admitted to the NICU.\nDATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases from 2005 to 2020.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: Guided by the lactation conceptual model, the authors searched for peer-reviewed studies with terms related to milk volume, pump dependency, critically ill infants, and modifiable factors, which may influence milk volume and assessed 46 eligible studies.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 3 reviewers with a systematic staged review approach.\nRESULTS: Evidence from 26 articles found expressed milk volume may be influenced by multiple potentially modifiable factors. Simultaneous expression with a hospital-grade electric pump at least 5 times per day beginning 3 to 6 hours after delivery, and adding complementary techniques including hand expression, hands-on-pumping, music, breast massage, warm compresses, skin-to-skin care, and the mother expressing near her infant may promote increased milk volume.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Healthcare providers should assist pump-dependent mothers with early initiation and frequent milk removal with a hospital-grade breast pump. Further research is needed to explore optimal frequency of expressions, dose and timing of skin-to-skin care, and other targeted strategies to improve expressed milk volume."

            "abstract": "Infancy has been proven as the best time to improve health outcomes for the later stage of life. The composition of human breast milk has evolved over millennia to support and maintain the infant's life during the early years of life. To achieve life-sustaining effects, human breast milk is packed with fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and a wide range of bioactive compounds such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and cytokines. The immunological compounds in breast milk have been shown to curtail gastrointestinal tract infections, respiratory tract infections, hospital admissions, acute otitis media, allergic reactions, and urinary tract infections. Although breastfeeding causes newborns to gain less weight at the beginning of their lives\u00a0than formula milk does, breast milk improves body composition by low adiposity. A higher adipose deposition in infants is linked with an increased risk of child obesity in the future. Due to significant health benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends initiating breastfeeding within one hour after birth and continuing for at least six months. Breastfeeding has emerged as a superior source of nutrition that can promote healthy physiological and cognitive development and protect against disease challenges in low birthweight infants. This review summarizes potential evidence that highlights the potential health impact of breast milk in low birthweight infants."

            "title": "Ocrelizumab during pregnancy and lactation: Rationale and design of the MINORE and SOPRANINO studies in women with MS and their infants.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) are not recommended during pregnancy, and discouraged while breastfeeding. However, discontinuation of some DMTs before pregnancy can leave women vulnerable to MS relapses. Although available data on ocrelizumab suggest no increased risk in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes, it is unknown whether ocrelizumab transfers across the placenta or is absorbed through breastmilk; and if so, whether infant B cell development, immune responses or growth and development are affected. This manuscript describes two studies designed to address these uncertainties.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: MINORE and SOPRANINO are multicentre open-label studies. MINORE, which addresses placental transfer, will recruit 44 women with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) exposed to ocrelizumab between 6\u00a0months before the last menstrual period (LMP) to the end of the first trimester. It will evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of potential in utero exposure through the proportion of infants with B cell numbers below lower limit of normal (LLN) at week 6 of life (primary endpoint); as well as through vaccine-induced antibody responses (reflecting B cell function) during the first year of life. Placental transfer will be assessed through measurement of ocrelizumab concentrations in paired samples at delivery (maternal blood as well as umbilical cord blood), and infant serum at week 6 of life. SOPRANINO, which evaluates breastmilk transfer, will recruit 20 women with MS or CIS who resume or initiate ocrelizumab treatment while breastfeeding. The effect of potential exposure through breastmilk will be assessed through the proportion of infants with B cell levels below LLN at 30 days after the mother's first post-partum ocrelizumab infusion (co-primary endpoint). Infant exposure via breastmilk will be assessed through ocrelizumab average daily infant dose in breastmilk over 60\u00a0days after the same infusion (co-primary endpoint). Vaccine-induced responses will be measured as in MINORE. Both studies will also measure infant growth and development over the first year of life and safety outcomes in both mothers and infants. All analyses will be descriptive, under an estimand framework.\nDISCUSSION: Both studies are designed to mimic real-world clinical practice. Treatment decisions for ocrelizumab are independent from study participation; as such, these studies will recruit women who decide, along with their physicians, to continue their pregnancies despite potential in utero exposure (for MINORE); or to breastfeed while under ocrelizumab treatment (for SOPRANINO). MINORE is the first prospective study to measure placental transfer of any DMT in MS, and to perform comprehensive assessments in infants and mothers. Results may inform the optimal contraception period for women treated with ocrelizumab who are planning a pregnancy. Similarly, SOPRANINO is the first prospective study to measure pharmacodynamic effects of ocrelizumab in breastfed infants in addition to pharmacokinetic parameters in breastmilk. SOPRANINO may establish whether breastfeeding is safe for infants whose mothers received treatment with ocrelizumab.\nCONCLUSION: By collecting detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety information, MINORE and SOPRANINO will contribute to understanding the risk/benefit of ocrelizumab in pregnant and lactating women with MS."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the past decade, various breastfeeding policies were implemented in Hong Kong, including changes in perinatal guidelines in public hospitals, adoption of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), provision of guidelines for the marketing of formula milk, penalisation of discrimination towards breastfeeding, and extension of the statutory maternity leave. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges and opportunities to breastfeeding practices. Infection control measures in public hospitals included the cancellation of antenatal classes, hospital tours, and postnatal classes; suspension of perinatal visiting periods; and compulsory separation of COVID-19 positive mothers from newborns. In addition, work-from-home policies were widely implemented. This study aimed to identify the associated factors of six-month predominant breastfeeding (PBF), and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding practice.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted from 1 March 2021 to 7 April 2021 using a mixed-methods approach. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to members of breastfeeding or parenting groups who have had breastfeeding experience in the past 10 yrs. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with six-month PBF both in general and during the pandemic period. A qualitative content analysis was conducted using an inductive approach.\nRESULTS: The study included 793 participants. Giving birth in a public hospital (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.46, 3.34) and breastfeeding support from family and friends (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.05, 1.57) were significantly associated with six-month PBF, even during COVID-19. Factors associated with the self-rated impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding include working from home, the perceived immunological benefits of breastfeeding, and the wish to avoid breastfeeding or expressing breast milk in public premises. Furthermore, breastfeeding practice in public hospitals was more likely to be affected by the busyness of staff, while private hospitals had worse rooming-in practices and staff who had inadequate breastfeeding knowledge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Giving birth in a public hospital and having breastfeeding support from family and friends were associated with six-month PBF. Furthermore, COVID-19 in Hong Kong had an overall positive impact on six-month PBF. Further studies should investigate the impact of hospital practices and the COVID-19 pandemic on breastfeeding behaviours."

            "abstract": "In the follow-up of Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, the focus in the first 5 years is to detect recurrence, while after 5 years, the focus is on limiting and detecting late effects of treatment. In the first 5 years post-treatment, routine history and physical and computed tomography (CT) imaging (more frequent in the first 2 years) are generally appropriate. However, there are limited data to support the role of positron emission tomography scanning as routine follow-up. Beyond 5 years post-treatment, annual history and physical is appropriate, although there is no longer a role for routine imaging for recurrences. Women irradiated to the chest area at a young age (<35) would benefit from annual mammogram screening given the increased breast cancer risk. Magnetic resonance imaging can be considered, although there is a lack of data supporting its role in this population. Low-dose chest CT for lung cancer screening in patients with history of mediastinal irradiation and/or alkylating chemotherapy exposures and a smoking history can be considered, although data on its utility is lacking. Cardiac screening with echocardiogram and exercise tolerance tests in patients with history of mediastinal irradiation and/or adriamycin exposure may be appropriate, although the optimal screening interval would depend on mediastinal dose, adriamycin dose, presence of other cardiac risk factors and findings at the baseline screening. Patients at risk for cardiac disease due to treatment exposure would also benefit from lipid screening every 1-3 years."

We advocate for a uniform approach to the treatment of these patients, including proper patient education and utilizing drugs with proven efficacy and minimal side effects. First-line pharmacologic agents are acetaminophen and NSAIDs; muscle relaxants can be used for spasms and pain reduction, and opioids should be minimized. Continued activity, rather than bed rest, is recommended, and lumbar spine orthotics may be used to reduce pain and augment functional status. Thermotherapy, cryotherapy, TENs, spinal manipulative therapy, and acupuncture may all be used as adjuncts to improve acute LBP."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of adding pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice on feelings of reassurance and management intentions among people with acute low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: Three-arm parallel-group randomized experiment. METHODS: We recruited people with acute LBP (pain for \u22646 weeks) to participate in an online experiment. Participants were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: guideline advice alone or guideline advice with the addition of brief pain science or ergonomics messages. The intervention was delivered via prerecorded videos in all 3 groups. Coprimary outcomes were reassurance that (1) no serious condition is causing LBP and (2) continuing with daily activities is safe. Secondary outcomes were perceived risk of developing chronic pain, management intentions (bed rest, see a health professional, see a specialist, and imaging), credibility, and relevance of the advice in addressing the participant's concerns. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred ninety-seven responses (99.3% of 2,313 randomized) were analyzed. Adding brief pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not change reassurance that LBP was not caused by serious disease. The addition of ergonomics advice provided worse reassurance that it is safe to continue with daily activities compared to guideline advice (mean difference [MD], -0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.53). There was no difference between groups on management intentions. CONCLUSION: Adding pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not increase reassurance or change management intentions in people with acute LBP. Ergonomics messages may lead to reduced feelings of reassurance. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(12)1-11. Epub 26 September 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.12090."

A 75-years-old woman diagnosed with PD for 19 years and PS has been developed. She recently has acute and severe low back pain. No recent injury or fall. After clinical examination and radiograph imaging, moderate wedge compression OF at L2 was revealed without a spinal cord or nerve compression. A program of conservative treatment was applied include antiosteoporotic supplementary, 6-days of bed rest, spine orthosis, and 10-weeks of exercises. The study adapted to use the following outcomes: visual analogues scale for low back pain, wall goniometer for lateral trunk flexion, and Oswesrty disability index for disability. After the intervention, the outcomes were improved as these values: visual analogues scales 7 points, lateral trunk flexion 20\u00b0, and Oswesrty disability index 60%. The case report suggests that the posture deformity as PS in PD may increase the risk of spine OF. The conservative treatment could be beneficial and safe for the OF in PD and PS.

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pyogenic spondylitis of the lumbar spine markedly decreases the ability to perform activities of daily living and causes severe low back pain. The challenge is to improve low back pain and activities of daily living performance earlier and prevent post-infection sequelae, and conservative treatment with antibiotics is the mainstay of treatment.\nMETHODS: In the present study, patients who were unable to walk following lumbar pyogenic spondylitis even in the subacute phase after successful infection control, showing bone defects expanding from endplate to vertebral body in CT, were treated with posterior percutaneous short-range instrumentation and anterior autogenous bone grafting (group S, n = 10) or with conservative treatment alone (group C, n = 10). Acute cases of absolute surgical indication with paralytic symptoms and mild cases who could walk by antibiotics administration were excluded. The two groups were compared regarding the post-treatment change in C-reactive protein level, duration of bed rest, and post-infection local spinal deformities (local scoliosis angle in the coronal plane and local kyphosis angle in the sagittal plane).\nRESULTS: Compared with group C, group S took a significantly shorter time for the C-reactive protein level to return to normal and required a significantly shorter duration of bed rest. Furthermore, surgery prevented the formation of kyphosis and scoliosis, while group C developed local kyphosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive surgical method of posterior percutaneous short-range instrumentation and anterior autogenous bone grafting effectively enables early control of pain and maintenance of locomotive function and prevents spinal deformity in patients with lumbar pyogenic spondylitis in the subacute phase with advanced vertebral bone destruction."

In Germany, about 70% of adults have at least one episode of back pain per year.\nMETHODS: This review is based on a selective literature search and on the German National Disease Management Guideline for Low Back Pain.\nRESULTS: The physician taking the history from a patient with back pain should ask about the nature, onset, course, localization, and radiation of the pain and its dependence on physical activity and/or emotional stress. In the differential diagnosis, neurologic deficits and any \"red flags\" suggesting dangerous conditions such as spinal fracture, bacterial infection, and tumors must be ruled out. If no specific cause of the pain can be identified, no imaging studies are indicated on initial presentation. The treatment of acute, nonspecific low back pain focuses on pain relief and functional improvement. Adequate patient education and counseling are essential. Exercise therapy is no more effective than the continuation of normal daily activities. Restriction of activity, including bed rest, is of no benefit and merely prolongs recovery and the resumption of normal activity. Further diagnostic testing is indicated if there is any suspicion of a fracture, infection, or tumor.\nCONCLUSION: After dangerous conditions have been ruled out, low back pain can be pragmatically classified as either nonspecific or specific. More research is needed so that the diagnostic assessment and individualized treatment of acute lower back pain can be further refined."

Data on pain, activity/participation and adverse events were extracted. Methodological quality and quality of evidence were assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale (score range 0-10) and the GRADE criteria, respectively.\nRESULTS: Five RCTs (total n = 350) were identified including one placebo-controlled and four controlled trials examining analgesics (2 studies) and orthoses (3). PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 7. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. In two trials, spinal orthoses provided significantly higher medium-term pain relief [pooled standardized mean differences (SMD): -1.47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -1.82, -1.13; I (2) = 0 %] and disability reduction (pooled SMD: -1.73, 95 % CI -2.09, -1.37; I (2) = 0 %) than no intervention. Immediate- and short-term pain effects of diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and tramadol (a strong opioid) were demonstrated when compared to a Chinese medicine, whereas non-significant effects were found for oxycodone and tapentadol (strong opioids) in a placebo-controlled trial. Low/insufficient statistical power, co-interventions and potential conflict of interest might have influenced the results.\nCONCLUSIONS: At present, there is insufficient evidence to inform conservative care for acute pain related to VCF.

            "abstract": "Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal symptom in pregnancy that can present as lumbar pain or pelvic girdle pain, with significant physical and psychosocial implications. Pelvic girdle pain is more prevalent and results in greater disability than lumbar pain. It is possible to distinguish between these two conditions from a detailed history based on the site of the pain, its intensity, disability and pain provocation tests. Management of low back pain in pregnancy is conservative, with physical exercise for lumbar pain and minimising activities that exacerbate pain, analgesics and bed rest for pelvic girdle pain, as well as avoiding abduction beyond the pain-free zone in labour. There is evidence that stabilising exercises in patients with pelvic girdle pain postpartum have a beneficial effect. Other treatment modalities that have been shown to be safe and effective include pelvic belts, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, spinal manipulative therapy, acupuncture and complementary therapy with yoga. Other orthopaedic complications in pregnancy such as carpal tunnel syndrome, pubic symphysis rupture, transient osteoporosis and osteonecrosis are usually self-limiting with a satisfactory outcome. However, a lack of awareness and failure to recognise these complications can result in long-term morbidity. Knowledge of the preoperative diagnostic investigations, surgical approaches and intraoperative positioning of the mother to avoid gravid uterus compression is vital in orthopaedic emergencies such as lumbar disc herniation, cauda equina syndrome, fractures and acute compartment syndrome of the lower limb to ensure a safe maternal and fetal outcome and to prevent serious disability. Pregnancy is not contraindicated in women with pre-existing orthopaedic complications such as kyphoscoliosis and total hip arthroplasty as there is no evidence to suggest increased maternal or fetal risks."

There was very-low-quality evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and diclofenac \"when required\" dosing) provide an immediate analgesic effect (mean differences -10.9 [95% confidence interval = -17.6 to -4.2] and -11.3 [95% confidence interval = -17.8 to -4.9], respectively). There is very-low-quality evidence that heat wrap and a capsicum-based rubefacient provide an immediate analgesic effect (mean differences -13.5 [95% confidence interval = -21.3 to -5.7] and 17.5, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, respectively), but there was no information on longer-term outcomes.\nPERSPECTIVE: There is limited evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heat wrap, and rubefacients provide immediate pain relief for acute back pain and that bed rest and advice are both ineffective. Future research is needed to provide evidence to support rational use of over-the-counter remedies and advice for people with acute low back pain."

Previous systematic reviews and practice guidelines have reached discordant results on the effectiveness of this therapy for low-back pain.\nOBJECTIVES: To resolve the discrepancies related to the use of spinal manipulative therapy and to update previous estimates of effectiveness, by comparing spinal manipulative therapy with other therapies and then incorporating data from recent high-quality randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) into the analysis.\nSEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were electronically searched from their respective beginning to January 2000, using the Back Group search strategy; references from previous systematic reviews were also screened.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized, controlled trials (RCT) that evaluated spinal manipulative therapy for patients with low-back pain, with at least one day of follow-up, and at least one clinically-relevant outcome measure.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors, who served as the authors for all stages of the meta-analysis, independently extracted data from unmasked articles. Comparison treatments were classified into the following seven categories: sham, conventional general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, back school, or a collection of therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful (traction, corset, bed rest, home care, topical gel, no treatment, diathermy, and minimal massage).\nMAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs were identified. Meta-regression models were developed for acute or chronic pain and short-term and long-term pain and function. For patients with acute low-back pain, spinal manipulative therapy was superior only to sham therapy (10-mm difference [95% CI, 2 to 17 mm] on a 100-mm visual analogue scale) or therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful. Spinal manipulative therapy had no statistically or clinically significant advantage over general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, or back school. Results for patients with chronic low-back pain were similar. Radiation of pain, study quality, profession of manipulator, and use of manipulation alone or in combination with other therapies did not affect these results.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that spinal manipulative therapy is superior to other standard treatments for patients with acute or chronic low-back pain."

            "abstract": "Acute low back pain is one of the most common reasons for adults to see a family physician. Although most patients recover quickly with minimal treatment, proper evaluation is imperative to identify rare cases of serious underlying pathology. Certain red flags should prompt aggressive treatment or referral to a spine specialist, whereas others are less concerning. Serious red flags include significant trauma related to age (i.e., injury related to a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash in a young patient, or from a minor fall or heavy lifting in a patient with osteoporosis or possible osteoporosis), major or progressive motor or sensory deficit, new-onset bowel or bladder incontinence or urinary retention, loss of anal sphincter tone, saddle anesthesia, history of cancer metastatic to bone, and suspected spinal infection. Without clinical signs of serious pathology, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing often are not required. Although there are numerous treatments for nonspecific acute low back pain, most have little evidence of benefit. Patient education and medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are beneficial. Bed rest should be avoided if possible. Exercises directed by a physical therapist, such as the McKenzie method and spine stabilization exercises, may decrease recurrent pain and need for health care services. Spinal manipulation and chiropractic techniques are no more effective than established medical treatments, and adding them to established treatments does not improve outcomes. No substantial benefit has been shown with oral steroids, acupuncture, massage, traction, lumbar supports, or regular exercise programs."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Low back pain affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point in their lives. Acute low back pain can be self-limiting; however, 1 year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute low back pain has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time.\nMETHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for acute low back pain? What are the effects of local injections for acute low back pain? What are the effects of non-drug treatments for acute low back pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nRESULTS: We found 49 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, advice to stay active, analgesics (paracetamol, opioids), back exercises, back schools, bed rest, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, epidural corticosteroid injections, lumbar supports, massage, multidisciplinary treatment programmes, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), spinal manipulation, temperature treatments (short-wave diathermy, ultrasound, ice, heat), traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)."

            "abstract": "Vertebral compression fractures represent a frequent pathology among elderly population, with potentially devastating consequences. More than 20\u00a0years have passed since percutaneous vertebroplasty was initially used in the treatment of angiomas, representing nowadays a widely used treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The authors present a retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients (in total 94 fractured levels) that underwent polymethylmethacrylate percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to senile or secondary osteoporosis. All fractures were free from neurologic involvement and were classified as A1 type according to Magerl classification. All of patients were initially treated conservatively, by application of orthosis that allows immediate deambulation. At control, patients who complained of pain and limitation of daily activities underwent MRI. If presence of marrow signal changes, especially hypertense signal in T2-weighted images was confirmed, percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure was performed (we could call it \"sub-acute\" procedure). A limited group of patients that did not tolerate brace and had an insufficient pain control underwent vertebroplasty \"in acute\", few days after fracture. Immediate post-operative pain reduction and follow-up clinical outcome (estimating quality of life and residual back pain) were evaluated by means of Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index. In the immediate post-operative course a significant pain relief was found in 39 patients (66.1%), moderate pain relief in 17 (28.8%), while 3 (5.1%) did not achieve relevant pain improvement. Pain intensity and life quality was maintained within satisfactory limits after a mean follow-up of 16\u00a0months. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective and safe procedure for treating vertebral compression fractures in the elderly. It provides immediate pain relief and allows early mobilization, thus avoiding potentially severe complications related to persistent back pain and prolonged bed rest. When performed by experienced surgeon complication rate is low, representing a safe procedure, able to provide a satisfactory outcome."

Debate continues on the comparative effectiveness of advice on bed rest and staying active as part of the primary care management.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with acute low-back pain or sciatica.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport, and SCISEARCH to May 2009, reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors of relevant articles.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of the effectiveness of advice to stay active or rest in bed for patients with acute LBP or sciatica. The main outcomes were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The trials were combined qualitatively or statistically, depending on data availability and presentation.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included ten RCTs with varying risk of bias.

Low quality evidence (1 RCT, N = 250) suggests little or no difference between physiotherapy, advice to rest in bed or stay active for patients with sciatica. No trials that compared different ways of delivering advice.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate quality evidence shows that patients with acute LBP may experience small benefits in pain relief and functional improvement from advice to stay active compared to advice to rest in bed; patients with sciatica experience little or no difference between the two approaches. Low quality evidence suggests little or no difference between those who received advice to stay active, exercises or physiotherapy.

            "abstract": "Bed rest is frequently prescribed for critically ill patients because it is assumed to be beneficial for preventing complications, for conserving scarce metabolic resources, and for providing patient comfort. Furthermore, higher levels of physical activity in critically ill patients have been assumed to be impractical or not feasible. Bed rest has been prescribed in the past for several other clinical conditions including acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis, cavitary tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and acute low back pain. However, randomized, controlled, clinical trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of bed rest in most of these conditions. Bed rest can cause several complications that may delay or prevent recovery from critical illnesses including disuse muscle atrophy, joint contractures, thromboembolic disease, and insulin resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility and safety of physical medicine programs in critically ill patients including those with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Other physical medicine tools, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation and passive stretching of muscles, may also reduce some complications of bed rest."

            "abstract": "GRADE A RECOMMENDATIONS (based on good-quality patient-oriented evidence): Advise patients to stay active and continue ordinary activity within the limits permitted by pain, avoid bed rest, and return to work early, which is associated with less disability. Consider McKenzie exercises, which are helpful for pain radiating below the knee. Recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if medication is necessary. COX-2 inhibitors, muscle relaxants, and opiate analgesics have not been shown to be more effective than NSAIDs for acute low back pain. Consider imaging if patients have no improvement after 6 weeks, although diagnostic tests or imaging is not usually required. GRADE B RECOMMENDATIONS (based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence): Reassure patients that 90% of episodes resolve within 6 weeks-regardless of treatment. Advise patients that minor flares-ups may occur in the subsequent year. Consider a plain lumbosacral spine x-ray if there is suspicion of spinal fracture or compression. Consider a bone scan after 10 days, if fracture is still suspected or the patient has multiple sites of pain. Suspect cauda equina syndrome or severe or progressive neurological deficit if red flags are present. Obtain complete blood count, urinalysis, and sedimentation rate if cancer or infection are possibilities. If still suspicious, consider referral or perform other studies. Remember that a negative plain film x-ray does not rule out disease. GRADE C RECOMMENDATIONS (based on consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, or case series): Recommend ice for painful areas and stretching exercises. Discuss the use of proper body mechanics and safe back exercises for injury prevention. Refer for goal-directed manual physical therapy if there is no improvement in 1 to 2 weeks, not modalities such as heat, traction, ultrasound, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Do not refer for surgery in the absence of red flags."

Factors associated with cough duration and clinical decisions were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of the 125 enrolled patients, 118 (94%) received an antibiotic, 97 (78%) a cough suppressant, 87 (70%) a systemic corticosteroid, and 39 (31%) a chest X-ray (CXR). Longer duration of cough was associated with the presence of self-reported wheezing or noises (adjusted odds ratio 6.29, 95% CI 1.36-29.16) while the presence of both wheezing and crackles on a clinician chest exam was associated with shorter duration (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.27).

However, this practice is seldom used because uncertainty about diagnosis, and fear of consequences of discontinuing antibiotic therapy, as well as perceived pressure to continue prescribing antibiotics and potential conflict with patients are more of a concern for GPs than antibiotic resistance. The main objective of this study is to determine whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy when a GP no longer considers it necessary has any impact on the number of days with severe symptoms.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial. The study was conducted in 10 primary care centres in Spain. We included patients from 18 to 75 years of age with uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infections-acute rhinosinusitis, acute sore throat, influenza or acute bronchitis-who had previously taken any dose of antibiotic for <3 days, which physicians no longer considered necessary. The patients were randomly assigned to the usual strategy of continuing antibiotic treatment or to discontinuing antibiotic therapy. A sample size of 240 patients per group was calculated on the basis of a reduction of 1\u2009day in the duration of severe symptoms being a clinically relevant outcome.

However, parents with pathogenic variants (PVs) in disease-causing genes may be interested in pursuing genetic testing that includes the familial PV for their children. The Pediatric Testing Attitudes Scale (P-TAS) was previously developed to examine high-risk parents' opinions about pediatric BRCA genetic testing for adult-onset breast/ovarian cancer. Here, the psychometric properties of the P-TAS were examined in a new sample of N\u00a0=\u00a0126 parents (M age\u00a0=\u00a047.2\u2009years) with PVs in a more complete set of cancer risk genes represented on DTC panel tests.

The internal consistency of the full scale was high (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.91). A factor analysis identified two-component scales, labeled Attitudes and Beliefs (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.93) and Decision Making and Communication (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.83).

However, on November 22, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted the sale of genetic health testing, on the grounds that 23andMe was not acting in accordance with federal law, by selling tests of undemonstrated reliability as predictive tests for medical risk factors. Consumers could still obtain the genetic ancestry report, but they no longer had access to the genetic health report in the United States (US). However, this did not prevent the company from continuing its health research, with previously obtained and future samples, provided that consent had been obtained from the consumers concerned, or with health reports for individuals from other countries. Furthermore, 23andMe was granted FDA authorization on February 19, 2015, first to provide reports about Bloom syndrome carrier status, and, more recently, to provide consumers with \"carrier status\" information for 35 genes known (with high levels of confidence) to cause disease.\nDISCUSSION: In this Debate, we highlight the likelihood that the primary objective of the company was probably two-fold: promoting itself within the market for predictive testing for human genetic diseases and ancestry at a low cost to consumers, and establishing a high-value database/biobank for research (one of the largest biobanks of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and personal information). By dint of this marketing approach, a two-sided market has been established between the consumer and the research laboratories, involving the establishment of a database/DNA biobank for scientific and financial gain.

            "abstract": "Building on seminal studies of the last 20 years, genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has become a clinical reality in the form of targeted exonic sequencing of known disease-causing genes. This has been driven primarily by the decreasing cost of sequencing, but the high profile of genome-wide association studies, the launch of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and new legislative protection have also played important roles. In the clinical management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, genetic testing is primarily used for family screening. An increasing role is recognized, however, in diagnostic settings: in the differential diagnosis of HCM; in the differentiation of HCM from hypertensive or athlete's heart; and more rarely in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Aside from diagnostic clarification and family screening, use of the genetic test for guiding therapy remains controversial, with data currently too limited to derive a reliable mutation risk prediction from within the phenotypic noise of different modifying genomes. Meanwhile, the power of genetic testing derives from the confidence with which a mutation can be called present or absent in a given individual. This confidence contrasts with our more limited ability to judge the significance of mutations for which co-segregation has not been demonstrated. These variants of \"unknown\" significance represent the greatest challenge to the wider adoption of genetic testing in HCM. Looking forward, next-generation sequencing technologies promise to revolutionize the current approach as whole genome sequencing will soon be available for the cost of today's targeted panel. In summary, our future will be characterized not by lack of genetic information but by our ability to effectively parse it."

The level of good hygiene practices (GHP) of respondents was calculated using Good Practice and Outbreak Prevention Indexes. The consumer behavior and the correlation between practices were performed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). 75% of respondents consume HMS, being 43% of interviewers doing this at least once per month. HMS was prepared from 30min to 1h before being served by 46% of individuals, it remaining for 30min to 1h at room temperature during the meal by 63% of people. Furthermore, 51% of respondents left the HMS container open or improperly closed, which may lead to cross-contamination. Most respondents (66%) stated reuse the HMS for less than one day (44%), at once (76%). 77% of participants declared that they prepare HMS, being only 7% preparing HMS without eggs. The majority (51%) used a cooked and a raw egg yolk. In addition, 75% of the cases showed raw eggs in recipe. The Weighted Good Practice Index, Weighted Outbreak Prevention Index and Weighted Harmonic Outbreak Prevention Index were 63%, 62% and 27% of participants, respectively. The MCA gathered the participants into two groups one commits various errors and other commits few errors on GHP. Thus, a consumer would probably perform multiple either good or bad practices simultaneously."

            "title": "Insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence and correlates in a multi-ethnic population Singapore.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Globally, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on mental health. Sudden lifestyle changes, threatening information received through various sources, fear of infection and other stressors led to sleep disturbances such as insomnia. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of insomnia and its associated risk factors during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic among Singapore residents.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted online and in person, from May 2020 to June 2021, recruited Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 years and above, fluent in English, Chinese or Malay language. Respondents answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire, including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), stress scale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), chronic conditions checklist and COVID-19 related stressors (exposure to COVID-19, current and future perceived risk of infection). Chi-squared test followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine factors associated with insomnia.\nRESULTS: The study recruited 1129 respondents. Prevalence of insomnia was noted to be 7.4% in the sample. Insomnia was significantly associated with psychological distress- depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.001), financial loss as a source of stress (p\u2009<\u20090.012), ever been diagnosed with asthma (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and backache (p\u2009<\u20090.002).\nCONCLUSION: Insomnia was prevalent and associated with higher level of psychological distress among Singapore residents. These findings can be utilised to design effective targeted interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy, therapist assisted relaxation and meditation programs to improve sleep and reduce psychological distress. Interventions like these can be delivered via smartphone applications enabling easy access, delivery, and utilization by the vulnerable groups. Overall, these strategies would not only help people maintain better mental health and sleep quality during a pandemic but also build resilience, enhancing society's ability to cope with future crises."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interventions incorporating meditation to address stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve self-management, are becoming popular for many health conditions. Stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and clusters with other modifiable behavioural risk factors, such as smoking. Meditation may therefore be a useful CVD prevention strategy.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of meditation, primarily mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and transcendental meditation (TM), for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers on 14 November 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 12 weeks or more in adults at high risk of CVD and those with established CVD. We explored four comparisons: MBIs versus active comparators (alternative interventions); MBIs versus non-active comparators (no intervention, wait list, usual care); TM versus active comparators; TM versus non-active comparators.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were CVD clinical events (e.g. cardiovascular mortality), blood pressure, measures of psychological distress and well-being, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included other CVD risk factors (e.g. blood lipid levels), quality of life, and coping abilities. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 81 RCTs (6971 participants), with most studies at unclear risk of bias. MBIs versus active comparators (29 RCTs, 2883 participants) Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were reported in six trials (388 participants) where heterogeneity was considerable (SBP: MD -6.08 mmHg, 95% CI -12.79 to 0.63, I2 = 88%; DBP: MD -5.18 mmHg, 95% CI -10.65 to 0.29, I2 = 91%; both outcomes based on low-certainty evidence). There was little or no effect of MBIs on anxiety (SMD -0.06 units, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.13; I2 = 0%; 9 trials, 438 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or depression (SMD 0.08 units, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.24; I2 = 0%; 11 trials, 595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Perceived stress was reduced with MBIs (SMD -0.24 units, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.03; I2 = 0%; P = 0.03; 6 trials, 357 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on well-being (SMD -0.18 units, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.32; 1 trial, 63 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on smoking cessation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.68; I2 = 79%; 6 trials, 1087 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported CVD clinical events or adverse events. MBIs versus non-active comparators (38 RCTs, 2905 participants) Clinical events were reported in one trial (110 participants), providing very low-certainty evidence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.42). SBP and DBP were reduced in nine trials (379 participants) but heterogeneity was substantial (SBP: MD -6.62 mmHg, 95% CI -13.15 to -0.1, I2 = 87%; DBP: MD -3.35 mmHg, 95% CI -5.86 to -0.85, I2 = 61%; both outcomes based on low-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence of reductions in anxiety (SMD -0.78 units, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.41; I2 = 61%; 9 trials, 533 participants; low-certainty evidence), depression (SMD -0.66 units, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.41; I2 = 67%; 15 trials, 912 participants; low-certainty evidence) and perceived stress (SMD -0.59 units, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.29; I2 = 70%; 11 trials, 708 participants; low-certainty evidence) but heterogeneity was substantial. Well-being increased (SMD 0.5 units, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.91; I2 = 47%; 2 trials, 198 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on smoking cessation (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.13; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 453 participants; low-certainty evidence). One small study (18 participants) reported two adverse events in the MBI group, which were not regarded as serious by the study investigators (RR 5.0, 95% CI 0.27 to 91.52; low-certainty evidence). No subgroup effects were seen for SBP, DBP, anxiety, depression, or perceived stress by primary and secondary prevention. TM versus active comparators (8 RCTs, 830 participants) Clinical events were reported in one trial (201 participants) based on low-certainty evidence (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49). SBP was reduced (MD -2.33 mmHg, 95% CI -3.99 to -0.68; I2 = 2%; 8 trials, 774 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with an uncertain effect on DBP (MD -1.15 mmHg, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.55; I2 = 53%; low-certainty evidence). There was little or no effect on anxiety (SMD 0.06 units, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.33; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 200 participants; low-certainty evidence), depression (SMD -0.12 units, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.07; I2 = 0%; 5 trials, 421 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or perceived stress (SMD 0.04 units, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.57; I2 = 70%; 3 trials, 194 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported adverse events or smoking rates. No subgroup effects were seen for SBP or DBP by primary and secondary prevention. TM versus non-active comparators (2 RCTs, 186 participants) Two trials (139 participants) reported blood pressure, where reductions were seen in SBP (MD -6.34 mmHg, 95% CI -9.86 to -2.81; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence) and DBP (MD -5.13 mmHg, 95% CI -9.07 to -1.19; I2 = 18%; very low-certainty evidence). One trial (112 participants) reported anxiety and depression and found reductions in both (anxiety SMD -0.71 units, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.32; depression SMD -0.48 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.11; low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported CVD clinical events, adverse events, or smoking rates.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large number of studies included in the review, heterogeneity was substantial for many of the outcomes, which reduced the certainty of our findings. We attempted to address this by presenting four main comparisons of MBIs or TM versus active or inactive comparators, and by subgroup analyses according to primary or secondary prevention, where there were sufficient studies. The majority of studies were small and there was unclear risk of bias for most domains. Overall, we found very little information on the effects of meditation on CVD clinical endpoints, and limited information on blood pressure and psychological outcomes, for people at risk of or with established CVD. This is a very active area of research as shown by the large number of ongoing studies, with some having been completed at the time of writing this review. The status of all ongoing studies will be formally assessed and incorporated in further updates."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Training outcomes of mindfulness interventions for anxiety have been extensively researched. Less is known about the acute effects of mindfulness induction and associated mechanisms. This systematic review aimed to identify 1) the effect of mindfulness induction on pre-post measures of state anxiety and attention among adults experiencing high levels of anxiety; and 2) the impact of predictors, mediators and moderators on post-induction changes in anxiety and attention. State distress and mindfulness were included as secondary outcomes.\nMETHODS: A systematic search was conducted in November 2021 in electronic databases using relevant search terms. Five studies (four randomised controlled trials and one non-randomised controlled trial) were included, comprising a total of 277 participants with elevated trait/generalised anxiety. Each study used a brief audio-based mindfulness induction exercise.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated mindfulness induction had medium and large effects on state anxiety (k\u00a0=\u00a03, n\u00a0=\u00a0100, g\u00a0=\u00a0-0.60, 95%CI [-1.04, -0.16]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and state mindfulness (k\u00a0=\u00a02, n\u00a0=\u00a0110, g\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95%CI [0.52, 1.30], p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), respectively, when compared with non-therapeutic control conditions. Furthermore, two studies showed small and moderate effects of mindfulness on state anxiety when compared to therapeutic active controls, but were not pooled in a meta-analysis. While results could not be pooled for attention, there was limited evidence of behavioural improvements on tasks measuring aspects of attention following mindfulness induction. However, one study found an increase in Low Beta to High Beta ratio and a reduction in Beta activity in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex following mindfulness induction. Moreover, another study found aspects of state mindfulness mediated reductions in state anxiety.\nLIMITATIONS: A small number of studies were included in the review, with high risk of bias and low certainty of evidence present.\nCONCLUSION: The findings support the use of mindfulness induction to reduce state anxiety in anxious individuals but suggest gains in state mindfulness may be a more realistic expected outcome. Further controlled trials are needed to delineate the relative effects of objectively assessed anxiety outcomes from mindfulness induction in clinically defined samples."

            "abstract": "The development of objective methods for assessing stress levels is an important task of applied neuroscience. Analysis of EEG recorded as part of a behavioral self-control program can serve as the basis for the development of test methods that allow classifying people by stress level. It is well known that participation in meditation practices leads to the development of skills of voluntary self-control over the individual's mental state due to an increased concentration of attention to themselves. As a consequence of meditation practices, participants can reduce overall anxiety and stress levels. The aim of our study was to develop, train and test a convolutional neural network capable of classifying individuals into groups of practitioners and non-practitioners of meditation by analysis of eventrelated brain potentials recorded during stop-signal paradigm. Four non-deep convolutional network architectures were developed, trained and tested on samples of 100 people (51 meditators and 49 non-meditators). Subsequently, all structures were additionally tested on an independent sample of 25 people. It was found that a structure using a one-dimensional convolutional layer combining the layer and a two-layer fully connected network showed the best performance in simulation tests. However, this model was often subject to overfitting due to the limitation of the display size of the data set. The phenomenon of overfitting was mitigated by changing the structure and scale of the model, initialization network parameters, regularization, random deactivation (dropout) and hyperparameters of cross-validation screening. The resulting model showed 82 % accuracy in classifying people into subgroups. The use of such models can be expected to be effective in assessing stress levels and inclination to anxiety and depression disorders in other groups of subjects."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic took the entire world unawares and people were forced to stay indoors overnight. Due to this a drastic change ensued in lifestyle with many succumbing to various kinds of stresses and psychological problems. This study aims to study the changing sleep patterns and level of anxiety among the working population due to the COVID-19 Pandemic lockdown.\nMETHODOLOGY: An online survey was conducted using a cloud-based website. The sleep patterns both prior to and during the lockdown period of the pandemic were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The level of anxiety during both these periods (before and during lockdown) amongst the working population was also assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scores (GADS).\nRESULTS: A total of 224 individuals participated in the study of which 52.7% were males and 47.3% were females. On analysis, the lifestyle and sleep deprivation scores showed that before the lockdown only 2.7% reported a low score out of total participants. However, this number was raised to 13.4% during the lockdown. The percentage of people reporting deteriorated sleep quality gradually increased with females reporting moderate to severe category of Generalized Anxiety Disorder scores as compared to Males.\nCONCLUSION: The study suggests that there has been a significant change in the sleep quality of the study participants due to Covid enforced lockdown which if unnoticed might lead to significant health problems. The effective use of programs like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises, if followed timely could reduce psychological distress to some extent."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Anxiety disorders are common, highly distressing, and impairing conditions. Effective treatments exist, but many patients do not access or respond to them. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are popular and can decrease anxiety, but it is unknown how they compare to standard first-line treatments.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether MBSR is noninferior to escitalopram, a commonly used first-line psychopharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial (Treatments for Anxiety: Meditation and Escitalopram [TAME]) included a noninferiority design with a prespecified noninferiority margin. Patients were recruited between June 2018 and February 2020. The outcome assessments were performed by blinded clinical interviewer at baseline, week 8 end point, and follow-up visits at 12 and 24 weeks. Of 430 individuals assessed for inclusion, 276 adults with a diagnosed anxiety disorder from 3 urban academic medical centers in the US were recruited for the trial, and 208 completed the trial.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were 1:1 randomized to 8 weeks of the weekly MBSR course or the antidepressant escitalopram, flexibly dosed from 10 to 20 mg.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was anxiety levels as assessed with the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale (CGI-S), with a predetermined noninferiority margin of -0.495 points.\nRESULTS: The primary noninferiority sample consisted of 208 patients (102 in MBSR and 106 in escitalopram), with a mean (SD) age of 33 (13) years; 156 participants (75%) were female; 32 participants (15%) were African American, 41 (20%) were Asian, 18 (9%) were Hispanic/Latino, 122 (59%) were White, and 13 (6%) were of another race or ethnicity (including Native American or Alaska Native, more than one race, or other, consolidated owing to low numbers). Baseline mean (SD) CGI-S score was 4.44 (0.79) for the MBSR group and 4.51 (0.78) for the escitalopram group in the per-protocol sample and 4.49 (0.77) vs 4.54 (0.83), respectively, in the randomized sample. At end point, the mean (SD) CGI-S score was reduced by 1.35 (1.06) for MBSR and 1.43 (1.17) for escitalopram. The difference between groups was -0.07 (0.16; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.23; P\u2009=\u2009.65), where the lower bound of the interval fell within the predefined noninferiority margin of -0.495, indicating noninferiority of MBSR compared with escitalopram. Secondary intent-to-treat analyses using imputed data also showed the noninferiority of MBSR compared with escitalopram based on the improvement in CGI-S score. Of patients who started treatment, 10 (8%) dropped out of the escitalopram group and none from the MBSR group due to adverse events. At least 1 study-related adverse event occurred for 110 participants randomized to escitalopram (78.6%) and 21 participants randomized to MBSR (15.4%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results from this randomized clinical trial comparing a standardized evidence-based mindfulness-based intervention with pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders found that MBSR was noninferior to escitalopram.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03522844."

Latinx youth also have less access to and lower utilization of mental health services. Emerging research supports the psychological and physical benefits of engaging in yoga and yoga may function as a complimentary treatment option for patients with mental health challenges. However, research assessing the efficacy of yoga and mindfulness is particularly sparse among Latinx youth, who may particularly benefit from mind body awareness activities given barriers to more traditional health approaches. The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to examine the effects of a 12-week Vinyasa flow-based yoga group intervention on anxiety, depression, empathy, and life satisfaction among adolescents receiving outpatient mental health treatment. Adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a0186; 12-17\u00a0years old) were recruited to an active intervention condition (Yoga); a subsequent group of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a091) were recruited in the same manner to an assessment-only comparison control condition (Comparison). The Yoga group participated in culturally and developmentally tailored group yoga classes for 12\u00a0weeks. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the main effect intervention response between participants in the two conditions. At the post-intervention assessment, after controlling for baseline levels of outcome variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, empathy, and life satisfaction), on average participants in the yoga condition reported: less depression symptoms (B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), less anxiety symptoms (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), greater empathy (B\u00a0=\u00a01.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and greater life satisfaction (B\u00a0=\u00a00.30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) as compared to the Comparison condition.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify and map the evidence on nonpharmacological interventions for acute pain management in patients with opioid tolerance or opioid abuse.\nINTRODUCTION: Opioid therapy is the mainstay of pain management for adults experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain. However, considering the known risks of opioid use and the growing number of patients with opioid tolerance or opioid abuse, nonpharmacological pain management interventions are of increasing interest to health care providers. Nonpharmacological techniques have shown potential in reducing postoperative pain, opioid consumption, stress, and anxiety.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible studies included participants in either inpatient or outpatient health care settings who were experiencing acute pain and a tolerance to opioid medications or opioid abuse. Studies that examined nonpharmacological interventions for treating acute pain in these patients were considered. Nonpharmacological interventions included, but were not limited to, acupuncture, electroacupuncture, massage, mindfulness, electroanalgesia, low-level light therapy, meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and relaxation techniques.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the US National Library of Medicine ( https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ ) were searched, as were sources of unpublished studies on December 30, 2020. Only studies published in English were included, and there was no limit on date of publication. After screening the titles and abstracts of identified citations, 2 independent reviewers retrieved potentially relevant full-text studies and extracted data. Data are presented in diagrammatic format, and accompany the narrative synthesis.\nRESULTS: Fourteen articles were included in the study, including 10 expert opinion papers or chapters, 3 case reports, and 1 implementation report. The most common setting was the perioperative setting, specifically orthopedic surgery. Nonpharmacological pain interventions identified in the literature included physical interventions such as acupuncture, physical therapy, therapeutic exercise, yoga, bracing, heat, cold, elevation, compression, chiropractic interventions, massage, manual therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. Behavioral and psychological modalities included positive affirmations, cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness, distraction, guided imagery, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation, hypnosis, breathing exercises, and energy healing. Many expert opinions included only brief mentions or recommendations for nonpharmacological interventions without full explanations, evidence from the literature, or discussion of the level of support for the recommendation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review indicate that nonpharmacological interventions for patients with opioid tolerance or dependence include physical, psychological, and multimodal approaches. Nonpharmacological interventions in this scoping review were often presented as combined with opioid or non-opioid medications for a pain management regimen that is opioid-sparing, opioid-free, or drug-free. More primary research is needed on the nonpharmacological acute pain management of patients with opioid dependence or opioid tolerance."

A total of 27 papers with 29 studies (one paper reported three studies) met inclusion criteria. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool is applied to assess the quality of all randomised controlled trials (RCT).\nRESULTS: All studies were recently conducted in 2020. Publications were from high-income (13, 44.8%), upper middle-income (12, 41.4%) and lower middle-income countries (3, 10.3%) and global (1, 3.5%). Half of the studies conducted for general population (51.7%). One-third of studies (8, 27.6%) provided interventions to patients with COVID-19 and 20.7% to healthcare workers. Of the 29 studies, 14 (48.3%) were RCT. All RCTs were assessed for risk of biases; five studies (15, 35.7%) had low risk as measured against all six dimensions reflecting high-quality study.Of these 29 studies, 26 diagnostic or screening measures were applied; 8 (30.9%) for anxiety, 7 (26.9%) for depression, 5 (19.2%) for stress, 5 (19.2%) for insomnia and 1 (3.8%) for suicide. Measures used to assess the baseline and outcomes of interventions were standardised and widely applied by other studies with high level of reliability and validity. Of 11 RCT studies, 10 (90.9%) showed that anxiety interventions significantly lowered anxiety in intervention groups. Five of the six RCT studies (83.3%) had significantly reduced the level of depression. Most interventions for anxiety and stress were mindfulness and meditation based.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results from RCT studies (11%, 78.6%) were effective in mitigating psychological consequences from COVID-19 pandemic when applied to healthcare workers, patients with COVID-19 and general population. These effective interventions can be applied and scaled up in other country settings through adaptation of modes of delivery suitable to country resources, pandemic and health system context."

            "abstract": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2, capable of high human transmission. To protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization proposed intervening guidance that included movement restrictions, isolation, restriction of national and international travel or movement, and full or partial closure of organizations and institutions. Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24\u00a0h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation."

It is further elevated with risk factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, an increase in triglycerides, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and so on, which manifests as atherosclerotic disease. Yoga-based lifestyle intervention is a noninvasive effective treatment method to control and prevent cardiac risk factors in CAD patients. Yoga has been used in India as a therapeutic method to manage hypertension and other chronic disorders and is fast gaining popularity as an effective means for the alleviation of stress, improvement of fitness, and enhancement of well-being. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of introducing the integrated approach of yoga therapy (IAYT) in a cardiac rehabilitation center in India and understand its usefulness in improving the cardiac function and managing the cardiac risk factors in acute myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Methods and Design: Cardiac patients were randomized to a yoga-practicing group (n\u2009=\u200933) and a control group (n\u2009=\u200933). The yoga-practicing group was instructed to attend three supervised IAYT classes 3 days per week for 12 weeks at the hospital yoga center. The control group received standard care that included pharmacologic treatment and the instructions of the cardiologist. The outcome measures were assessed at baseline (T1\u2009=\u20090) and completion (T2\u2009=\u20093 months). The primary outcome measure was the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Results: There was no statistically significant difference in LVEF (U\u2009=\u2009420.500, p value\u2009=\u20090.218) between the two groups. However, the yoga-practicing group showed significant reduction in depression (Cardiac Depression Scale [CDS], U\u2009=\u200971, p value\u2009=\u20090.0), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], U\u2009=\u2009128, p value\u2009=\u20090.0), and a significant increase in quality of life (QOL) scores (Duke Activity Status Index [DASI], U\u2009=\u2009146, p value\u2009=\u20090.0; and metabolic equivalents (METs), U\u2009=\u2009136, p value\u2009=\u20090.0) at 3 months compared to control. Overall, the CAD patients practicing yoga showed a favorable profile compared to control individuals on CDS, HAM-A, DASI, and MET outcomes. Control and yoga practicing groups did not differ significantly in the lipid levels. Conclusion: This study indicated that the integration of yoga practice in a cardiac rehabilitation program is feasible and has no added benefit in improving the cardiac function. However, the addition of yoga to cardiac rehabilitation may be beneficial in reducing depression and anxiety and improving QOL in patients."

            "title": "Efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention ('mindfulness-based joyful sleep') in young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia using a biomarker of inflammatory responses: a prospective protocol of a randomised controlled trial in China.",
            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a prevalent and significant public health concern. Insomnia can lead to increased inflammatory markers associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are more easily delivered within the community than cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) which was recommended as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, are effective in insomnia treatment and can reduce inflammatory markers level in older individuals with insomnia. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of an MBI to CBT-I in young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia disorder and explore its effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in inflammation.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This report describes a protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Seventy eligible participants will be assigned to mindfulness-based joyful sleep or CBT-I for 2-hour sessions weekly for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, severity of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and sleep parameters recorded using sleep diary and polysomnography. Secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The exploratory outcome is serum level of NF-\u03baB. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the ntervention period and at a 3\u2009month follow-up. Data will be analysed using general linear models, specifically analysis of covariance and analysis of variance will be used.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China (2018-S236). If Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep is proven effective, its dissemination will help bridge the gap between the unmet need and the demand for insomnia interventions in China.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03268629; Pre-results."

            "abstract": "QUESTION: A growing body of work suggests that medical students may be particularly at risk of mental ill health, suicidal ideation and behaviour, resulting in recent calls to develop interventions to prevent these outcomes. However, few reviews have synthesised the current evidence base regarding the effectiveness of these interventions and provided guidance to improve future intervention efforts.\nSTUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors conducted a systematic review to identify studies of any design reporting the effectiveness of any universal intervention to address these outcomes in medical students. Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from their respective start dates until 1 December 2017.\nFINDINGS: Data from 39 studies were included. Most investigated the effectiveness of relatively brief interventions designed to reduce stress; most commonly using mindfulness-based or guided meditation approaches. Only one implemented an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal ideation; none investigated the effectiveness of an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal behaviour. Five investigated the effects of curriculum-level changes. Overall, there was limited evidence of an effect for these programmes at both the postintervention and longest follow-up assessment on depression, anxiety and stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: Relatively brief, individually focused, mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing levels of anxiety, depression and stress in medical students in the short term. Effects on suicidal ideation and behaviour, however, remain to be determined. There has been a significant lack of attention on organisational-level stressors associated with medical education and training."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga (LY) is a group-based intervention involving simulated laughter, gentle stretching, rhythmic breathing and meditation. There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression.\nMETHODS: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention (n\u202f=\u202f23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual (n\u202f=\u202f27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2.\nRESULTS: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification.\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: World statistics for the prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders shows that a great number of individuals will experience some type of anxiety or mood disorder at some point in their lifetime. Mind-body interventions such as Hatha Yoga and seated meditation have been used as a form of self-help therapy and it is especially useful for challenging occupations such as teachers and professors.\nAIMS: In this investigation, we aimed at observing the impact of Yoga Nidra and seated meditation on the anxiety and depression levels of college professors.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty college professors, men and women, aged between 30 and 55 years were randomly allocated in one of the three experimental groups: Yoga Nidra, seated meditation, and control group. Professors were evaluated two times throughout the 3-month study period. Psychological variables included anxiety, stress, and depression.\nRESULTS: Data analysis showed that the relaxation group presented better intragroup results in the anxiety levels. Meditation group presented better intragroup results only in the anxiety variable (physical component). Intergroup analysis showed that, except for the depression levels, both intervention groups presented better results than the control group in all other variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prepost results indicate that both interventions represent an effective therapeutic approach in reducing anxiety and stress levels. However, there was a tendency toward a greater effectiveness of the Yoga Nidra intervention regarding anxiety, which might represent an effective tool in reducing both cognitive and physiological symptoms of anxiety."

            "title": "Comparative effects of meditation and exercise on physical and psychosocial health outcomes: a review of randomized controlled trials.",
            "abstract": "No review papers have examined studies that have directly compared non-active forms of meditation with exercise to evaluate effects on physical or psychosocial outcomes, which was the purpose of this paper. Studies were included if they had a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, included a non-active form of meditation and exercise as intervention arms, and evaluated physical or psychosocial outcomes. The quality of included RCTs was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The total sample size across all studies was N\u00a0=\u00a0325. Of the main outcomes assessed across the five studies, meditation was shown to be more effective than the exercise comparison arm when evaluating the psychosocial outcomes of anxiety, altruism, and life changes. Additionally, meditation was more effective at reducing chronic neck pain at rest and pain-related bothersomeness. Exercise, however, was more effective in improving physical health-related quality of life, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose levels. The interventions were found to be comparable when evaluating the outcomes of well-being, ethanol consumption, and perceived stress levels. Four of the evaluated studies were determined to have an overall 'unclear' risk of bias and one study was found to have a 'high' risk of bias. Exercise and non-active meditation may uniquely influence various health-related outcomes. A continued exploration of the effects of exercise and non-active meditation in controlled trials may yield a better understanding of their benefits."

            "abstract": "The interest in mindfulness meditation interventions has surged due to their beneficial effects in fostering resilience and reducing stress in both clinical and non-clinical populations. However, the relaxation benefits that may occur while practicing mindfulness meditation and long-term benefits of these interventions remain unclear. Fifty-one participants were recruited and randomized into the experimental and control groups, which underwent 4\u00a0days of Intensive Meditation (Templestay program, n\u00a0=\u00a033) and Relaxation (Control, n\u00a0=\u00a018), respectively. The self-report measures of Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS) and the modified Korean version of the Resilience Quotient Test (RQT) were administered pre-, post- and 3\u00a0months after the intervention to measure participants' levels of mindfulness and resilience. Participants in both the Templestay program and Control groups showed significant increases in their scores on CAMS and RQT after completing the program. During the 3-month follow-up, a significant interaction effect of the intervention method and time was revealed for the\u00a0individuals' CAMS and RQT\u00a0scores. Our findings support the hypothesis that while relaxation practices may have certain stress reduction effects, the effects are predominantly mediated by the mindfulness meditation practice. Furthermore, the long-term benefits of increased resilience observed in the Templestay program group suggest that the practice may be a possible treatment strategy in clinical populations, such as patients with depression and anxiety."

            "title": "The effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospital settings: a systematic review of quantitative evidence protocol.",
            "abstract": "REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospitalized patient care settings.\nBACKGROUND: Nursing professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. Many of these stressors have always been inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses have been experiencing increased stress related to other factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically attention and memory, and this increases the already high stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very difficult situations that require accurate, timely decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are factors that create scenarios for risk of patient harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses: burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state that nurses experience considerable job stress which has been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this opinion and state that work related stress is largely contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report that work stress leads to a much higher turnover, especially during the first year after graduation, lowering retention rates in general.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43% of the nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11% of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital's staffing level increased burnout by 23%.Depression can be defined as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1% of the nurses' counterparts who do not work in healthcare. High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38%) and Taiwanese nurses (27.7%). In the Taiwanese study the occurrence of depression was significantly and positively correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses (p<0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression, Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80% more likely to have suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A further finding in this study revealed that 75% of the participants also suffered from at least one chronic disease revealing a strong association between depression and other major health issues.A stressful working environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses as \"non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences\". Nurse-to-nurse lateral violence leads to negative workplace relationships and disrupts team performance, creating an environment where poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence. According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI) developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI model has been widely used in occupational health settings based on its predictive power for adverse health and well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma & Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model, occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by Reineck & Furino indicated that registered nurses had a very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their profession but that they identified workplace relationships and stress issues as some of the most important contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge, Skogstad & Einarsen state that work-related stress further increases the potential for lateral violence as it creates a negative environment for both the target and the perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as \"paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment\". The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment awareness. The program has proven to be effective in reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from the general public, the reviewers reported a significant reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups were compared. However, there have been limited studies to date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based interventions can also enhance nurses' capacity for focused attention and concentration by increasing present moment awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in everyday situations as well as stressful situations. According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences people differently based on their viewpoint and their interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective on the connectivity of all things and not operate on automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the best research evidence available pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The literature data show that relaxation practice is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms. Different techniques such as progressive muscular relaxation, autogenic training, applied relaxation and meditation have been evaluated independently for anxiety disorders. The question is to know whether the combination of various techniques may be of interest in the transdiagnostic treatment of anxiety disorders.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: The present study assessed the short-term efficacy of a 10-week integrative and transdiagnostic relaxation program for anxiety disorders in outpatients of an anxiety disorders unit.\nMETHODS: The diagnoses were made according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998) and completed with an assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms using: the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y, -S and -T), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Four techniques were integrated into the structured 10-week protocol: breathing control, muscular relaxation, meditation and mental visualization.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (12 men and 16 women), mean age (S.D.)=38.82 years (11.57), were included in the study. All the included patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for a current diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (n=13) or Panic Disorder (n=15) with or without agoraphobia. At the end of the 10 sessions, we found a significant reduction in mean scores (S.D.) on the STAI-T from 53.179 (6.037) to 49.821 (8.028) (P<0.02), the BDI-II 20.964 (13.167) to 15.429 (11.341) (d=0.6543) and the QIPS 55.071 (10.677) to 49.679 (11.7) (d=0.5938). The observed reduction in the STAI-S (d=0.2776) was not significant.\nDISCUSSION: The results of this open study showed that this program significantly decreases the level of trait anxiety, depression and worry. The integrative and transdiagnostic relaxation program could represent an accessible and effective treatment to reduce anxious and depressive symptoms in various anxiety disorders. Future research should address the development of controlled trials assessing the impact of the different dimensions of anxiety and the long-term effects of this protocol."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Family dementia caregivers are at high risk of depression and burnout. We assessed the feasibility of Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy for Caregivers (CMIT-C), a novel 8-week group meditation and guided imagery group therapy program, for dementia caregivers reporting stress because of caregiving responsibilities.\nMETHODS: Twelve family dementia caregivers enrolled in CMIT-C. Primary outcomes included depression and anxiety, and secondary outcomes included insomnia, quality of life, and mindfulness. Changes over the study and 3\u2009month follow-up were analyzed with non-parametric related samples tests. Correlations of feeling state changes from meditation diaries at 1\u2009week were made with symptom changes post meditation training.\nRESULTS: Ten participants completed the study. Completers came to an average of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20091 sessions out of a possible 8 sessions, and turned in home practice logs of 90\u2009\u00b1\u200910% of the time. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms decreased, and mindfulness ratings improved with large effects (all p\u2009<\u20090.05 and Cohen's d\u2009\u2265\u20090.7). Gains were stable at 3\u2009months. Early response during the first week of meditation practice was associated with subsequent home meditation practice, anxiety change at 8\u2009weeks, and endpoint satisfaction with CMIT-C.\nCONCLUSIONS: Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy for Caregivers is a feasible intervention for dementia caregivers. Results suggest that this therapeutic technique can reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and increase levels of mindfulness. Early response to meditation practice predicted those with the greatest short-term benefits, and this may inform future studies of meditation. Larger controlled efficacy studies of CMIT-C for dementia caregivers are warranted."
