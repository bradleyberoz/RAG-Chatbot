            "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer screening can reduce patient mortality. Multiple issues persist including timely management of patients with a radiologically defined indeterminate pulmonary nodule (IPN), which carries unknown pathological significance. This pilot study focused on combining demographic, clinical, radiographic, and common circulating biomarkers for their ability to aid in IPN risk of malignancy prediction.\nMETHODS: A case-control cohort consisting of 379 patients with IPNs (251 stage I lung tumors and 128 nonmalignant nodules) was used for this effort, divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Demographic variables (age, sex, race, ethnicity), radiographic information (nodule size and location), smoking pack-years, and plasma biomarker levels of CA-125, SCC, CEA, HE4, ProGRP, NSE, Cyfra 21-1, IL-6, PlGF, sFlt-1, hs-CRP, Ferritin, IgG, IgE, IgM, IgA, and Kappa and Lambda Free Light Chains were assessed for this purpose.\nRESULTS: Multivariable analyses of biomarker, demographic, and radiographic variables yielded a model consisting of age, lesion size, pack-years, history of extrathoracic cancer, upper lobe location, spiculation, hs-CRP, NSE, Ferritin, and CA-125 (AUC = 0.872 in training, 0.842 in testing) with superior performance over the Mayo Score model, which consists of age, lesion size, history of smoking, history of extrathoracic cancer, upper lobe location, and spiculation (AUC = 0.816 in training, 0.787 in testing).\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a simple reduced algorithm consisting of biomarkers, clinical information, and demographic variables may have value for malignancy prediction of screen-detected IPNs. Upon further validation, this method stands to reduce the need for serial radiographic studies and the risks of diagnostic delay."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: COPD is an established risk factor for lung cancer. Sleep apnoea is prevalent in COPD and the inflammation caused by intermittent hypoxaemia may increase this lung cancer risk. Females have more systemic inflammation for a similar apnoea-hypopnoea index than males. Therefore, this study aims to investigate sex-specific associations between sleep apnoea and lung cancer in COPD.\nMETHODS: The sex-specific absolute and relative risk of sleep apnoea on newly diagnosed lung cancer was estimated in a nationwide observational study of Belgian patients with COPD (\u226555 years), between 2017 and 2022, using an Aalan-Johanson estimator and a cause-specific Cox regression model adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcoholism, frailty, comorbidities, and comedication.\nFINDINGS: The study consisted of 62,903 COPD patients (42\u00b780% female), of whom 2898 (4\u00b760%) developed lung cancer. We found a significant sex interaction of sleep apnoea on lung cancer hazard ( \u03c7 -squared: 13\u00b7239, P-interaction &lt; 0\u00b701). In females, sleep apnoea was associated with a higher lung cancer risk (cumulative incidence: 1545 vs 1350 per 100,000 PY; aHR: 1\u00b731 (95% CI: 1\u00b705-1\u00b763)). For males, sleep apnoea patients had a lower lung cancer risk (cumulative incidence: 1632 and 2305 per 100,000 PY; aHR: 0\u00b782 (95% CI: 0\u00b770-0\u00b795)). The impact of sleep apnoea on lung cancer development was especially strong in female COPD patients with hypoxia-related comorbidities e.g., with a history of emphysema (aHR: 2\u00b765 (95% CI: 1\u00b711-6\u00b734)).\nINTERPRETATION: Sleep apnoea was associated with a higher risk of lung cancer in female COPD patients while, in males, there was a lower risk. Especially in female COPD patients with hypoxia, sleep apnoea is strongly associated with an increased lung cancer risk.\nFUNDING: Emmanuel van der Schueren cancer research fellowship \"Kom Op Tegen Kanker\"."

Hence, this study aims to analyze the factors related to the postoperative complications and mortality of patients with malignant lung tumor-and ILD after surgical resection.\nMETHODS: This study analyzed the clinical information, surgical conditions, preoperative computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) examination data, as well as postoperative follow-up data of 60 non-small cell LC patients and 60 non-small cell LC patients with interstitial lung disease (LC-ILD). In this study, 120 patients with non-small cell LC were retrospectively reviewed, of which 60 were assigned to LC group and 60 to LC-ILD group. Cohorts were evaluated for differences in clinical data, surgical conditions, preoperative CT/PET examination data, and postoperative follow-up data.\nRESULTS: The postoperative complications in the LC-ILD group were slightly higher than those in the LC group (P&lt;0.001), and the prognosis of LC patients with ILD was significantly worse than that of those without ILD (P=0.048). The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of noncancerous interstitial pneumonia (IP) area in patients with postoperative complications was higher than that of patients without complications (P=0.005), and it was the risk factor for postoperative complications in LC-ILD group [hazard ratio (HR) 3.384 (1.023-25.441); P=0.02]. Until the end of follow-up, the CT scores of non-survivors were higher than those of survivors (9.30\u00b13.56 vs. 5.52\u00b12.26; P=0.001). Age [HR 3.919 (1.094-7.789); P=0.04], the CT score [HR 2.352 (1.028-4.033); P=0.007], and smoking history [HR 0.354 (0.096-0.643); P=0.03] were the risk factors for mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The postoperative complications and mortality of LC-ILD significantly increase. Higher SUVR of noncancerous IP area usually indicates an increase of postoperative complications. Higher CT score and smoking history suggest a poor prognosis. A follow-up longitudinal study is needed to validate the findings."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is being increasingly recognized as an important clinical problem. The purpose of this prospective multicenter study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of CPSP at 3\u00a0months after surgery in a Japanese population.\nMETHODS: Adult patients who underwent lung cancer surgery (L) or knee arthroplasty (K) at university hospitals in Japan and provided informed consent were included. Perioperative demographic, clinical, and psychological data were collected. Postsurgical pain scores were assessed via face-to-face interviews at each time point. We also investigated analgesic use at each time point in patients with CPSP.\nRESULTS: A total of 494 (L) and 194 (K) patients completed our interviews at all visits up to 3\u00a0months after surgery. The prevalence of clinically relevant CPSP was 10% (L) and 28% (K), respectively. In both cohorts, pain intensity at 1\u00a0month after surgery was moderately correlated with pain intensity at 3\u00a0months after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations between preoperative chronic pain, current smoking status, and open thoracotomy with CPSP in the lung cohort. However, no pre- or intraoperative risk factors were identified in the knee cohort. None of the CPSP patients used strong opioids.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CPSP after lung cancer surgery and knee arthroplasty among Japanese patients was comparable with prevalences previously reported in other countries. Subacute pain was significantly correlated with CPSP; however, further studies are needed to determine whether intensive treatment of subacute postsurgical pain can prevent the development of CPSP."

This study aimed to describe the frequency and locations of preoperative pain and evaluate its impact on postoperative pain trajectories and chronic pain occurrence in a real-world setting.\nMETHODS: A prospective patient-reported outcome survey was conducted at Hitachi General Hospital. QOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 at three time points: preoperatively (Pre), 1\u00a0month postoperatively (M1), and 1\u00a0year postoperatively (Y1). Among 184 patients with complete data, chronic pain was defined as an increase of\u2009\u2265\u200910 points in the pain score from Pre to Y1.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five (30%) of the 184 patients reported experiencing pain at Pre.

In Chile, the incidence and mortality of this disease have risen in recent years. Most cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting treatment options to palliative care.\nAIM: characterize adult patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer at the Regional Hospital of Temuco between October 2019 and June 2023, and to analyze factors such as smoking, biomass exposure, symptoms at diagnosis, and molecular mutations.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on adult patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer at the Regional Hospital of Temuco between October 2019 and June 2023. Data was collected on biosociodemo-graphic characteristics, medical history, smoking, biomass exposure, symptoms at diagnosis, performance status, biopsy type, pathological results, and molecular mutation studies.\nRESULTS: Out of 256 patients diagnosed with lung cancer, 220 met the inclusion criteria for histo-logical confirmation. 55.3% were male, with a mean age of 68 \u00b1 9.5 years. 67.7% had a history of smoking, and 30.1% were exposed to biomass. 98.6% presented symptoms at diagnosis, with cough being the most common. The majority (81.9%) were diagnosed at advanced stages (III-IV). 63.9% of diagnoses were adenocarcinomas, with EGFR mutations found in 13.6% and ALK mutations in 2.1%. PDL-1 expression was detected in 18.8% of cases. Significant associations were found between EGFR and ALK mutations, which were more predominant in non-smokers, and between PDL-1 expression and biomass exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer primarily affects men, with a mean age at diagnosis similar to that reported in other studies. Smoking remains the main risk factor, while biomass exposure also contributes to risk in the region. Most patients were diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent subtype, with EGFR and ALK mutations found at lower rates than in other national studies. PDL-1 expression showed a significant association with bio-mass exposure and advanced stages of the disease."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported higher lung cancer incidence among groups with lower socioeconomic position (SEP). However, it is not known how this difference in lung cancer incidence between SEP groups varies across different geographical settings. Furthermore, most prior studies that assessed the association between SEP and lung cancer incidence were conducted without detailed adjustment for smoking. Therefore, we aimed to assess this relationship across world regions.\nMETHODS: In this international prospective cohort consortium study, we used data from the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3), which includes 20 prospective population cohorts from 16 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Participants were enrolled between 1985 and 2010 and followed for cancer outcomes using registry linkages and/or active follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between educational level (our primary measure of SEP, in 4 categories) and incident lung cancer using Cox proportional hazards models separately for participants with and without a smoking history. The models were adjusted for age, sex, cohort (when multiple cohorts were included), smoking duration, cigarettes per day, and time since cessation.\nFINDINGS: Among 2,487,511 participants, 53,830 developed lung cancer during a 13.5-year median follow-up (IQR\u00a0=\u00a06.5-15.0 years). Among participants with a smoking history, higher education was associated with decreased lung cancer incidence in nearly every cohort after detailed smoking adjustment. By world region, this association was observed in North America (HR per one-category increase in education [HR<sub>trend</sub>]\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-0.89), Europe (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.88-0.91), and Asia (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86-0.96), but not in the Australian study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.95-1.09). By histological subtype, education associated most strongly with squamous cell carcinoma and more weakly with adenocarcinoma (p-heterogeneity &lt; 0.0001). Among participants who never smoked, there was no association between education and lung cancer incidence in any cohort (all p-trend &gt; 0.05), except the USA Southern Community Cohort Study (HR<sub>trend</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.62-0.90).\nINTERPRETATION: Based on longitudinal data from 2.5 million participants from 16 countries, our findings suggest that higher educational attainment was associated with lower lung cancer risk among participants with a smoking history, but not among participants who never smoked. Limitations of our study include that cohort participants cannot fully represent the general populations of the geographical regions included, and education was the only measure of SEP consistently available across our consortium.\nFUNDING: This study was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Lung Cancer Research Foundation (LCRF), and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)."

            "abstract": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated its lung cancer screening (LCS) recommendation in 2021 and the American Cancer Society (ACS) updated its LCS guidelines in 2023. Each update expanded screening eligibility criteria; thus increasing the total number of individuals eligible for lung cancer screening. However, it is not clear whether different population subgroups benefit equally from the recent updates of LCS recommendations in terms of becoming newly eligible. We identified 85,395 individuals who were between 50 and 80 years old, smoked cigarettes formerly or currently, and did not have a history of lung cancer from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys of 2022. We used descriptive analysis to illustrate the weighted proportions of newly screening eligible population among different subgroups. We also applied multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios of being newly eligible for LCS under each LCS recommendation update in 2021 and 2023. For both LCS updates, individuals who were non-Hispanic White, male, and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly more likely to become newly eligible for LCS. A significantly larger proportion of older-age individuals became newly eligible under the 2023 ACS guideline. Noticeably, both guideline updates substantially increased the population eligible for screening among males and older individuals, two groups experiencing the majority of lung cancer incidence and mortality. Results also indicate the screening eligibility criteria updates did not increase the odds ratio of being eligible among racial/ethnic minority and female subgroups."

Current screening criteria rely on smoking history and age, missing other risk factors. This study aimed to identify clinical risk factors and social determinants of health (SDoH) for enhanced risk assessment using electronic health record (EHR) data.\nMETHODS: We analyzed 410 298 patient records from the All of Us Research Program, including 9375 lung cancer cases identified through SNOMED coding. Using Logistic LASSO regression, we developed predictive models based on diagnoses grouped by body systems and their interactions.\nRESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune systems showed three-fold greater association with lung cancer than other systems. Brain metastasis showed the strongest association (odds ratio 5.0, 95% CI: 4.2-5.8). The final model achieved an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80-0.84) and 78% sensitivity in validation. Patients with documented social determinants showed 2.5-fold higher risk (95% CI: 2.1-2.9).\nCONCLUSIONS: EHR-based prediction models effectively identify lung cancer risk using readily available medical history data.

Then, the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster and their interaction effects with AN chewing and smoking on lung cancer were analyzed. In addition, we explored the associations among AN, cigarettes, and genes related to lung cancer using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).\nRESULTS: The results indicate that the CHRNA3 rs938682 (A\u2009>\u2009G) GG genotype (OR\u2009=\u20090.669, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.454\u2009~\u20090.984, P\u2009=\u20090.042) can decrease the risk of lung cancer.

The interplay between sex and IAP on lung cancer remains unclear. We conducted a population-based case-control study in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2003 to 2010, with 2871 lung cancer cases and 8019 controls. Exposures and covariates information were collected via in-person interviews using a standardized questionnaire. An integrated weighted risk score (WRS), accounting for the effect sizes of each source of IAP, was introduced. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interactions between sex and IAP by tobacco smoking status were evaluated. Environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.69), poor ventilation (aOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.30), and coal used for cooking (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41) were associated with lung cancer. Dose-response relationships between lung cancer and WRS were observed, with p for trend less than 0.001. aOR for individuals at the highest quartile of the WRS of IAP was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.00) compared to the lowest quartile. The associations were more profound among never-smokers than ever-smokers. Females tended to be more vulnerable to IAP, and sex interacted with IAP beyond multiplicativity on the odds scale. IAP is associated with lung cancer, with a stronger impact among never-smokers. An interaction between IAP and sex was observed. These results underscore the importance of controlling IAP, especially ETS in order to reduce the risk of lung cancer."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air fine particulate matter and tobacco smoke exposure are primary risk factors for lung cancer. However, their recent global exposure levels, attributable burden, and patterns of inequalities remain insufficiently quantified.\nMETHODS: Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, we analyzed exposure levels of air fine particulate matter (ambient and household) and tobacco smoke (active and secondhand) by age-standardized summary exposure value (ASEV). Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) were used to assess their attributable lung cancer burden globally. Temporal patterns were examined using weighted average annual percentage change (WAPC). Cross-national health inequalities were evaluated with the concentration index (CI) for ASMR and slope index of inequality (SII) for ASDR.\nRESULTS: In 2021, air fine particulate (PM2.5) exposure peaked in low socio-demographic index (SDI) countries, while tobacco exposure was highest in high-middle SDI regions. Globally, air PM2.5 contributed to 374.21 thousand (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 236.36, 520.26) lung cancer deaths [ambient: 297.60 thousand (95% UI: 183.71, 414.74); household: 76.48 thousand (95% UI: 28.6, 187.34)], whereas tobacco exposure caused 1,238.65 thousand (95% UI: 1,075.69, 1,423.12) deaths [active smoking: 1,195.80 thousand (95% UI: 1,054.67, 1,359.22); secondhand smoke: 97.91 thousand (95% UI: 11.96, 184.91)]. High-middle SDI countries and the Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania regions bore the greatest burden. The attributable burden for males exceeded that for females by approximately twofold for air PM2.5 and fivefold for tobacco exposure. The 55\u2009+\u2009age group showed disproportionately high impacts despite lower exposure. From 1990 to 2021, the ASMR attributable to air PM2.5 and tobacco exposure changed annually by -1.32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.48, -1.16) and -\u20090.95% (95% CI: -1.03, -0.88), respectively. The attributable ASDR also showed declining trends. Regarding translational health inequality, the air PM2.5 attributable lung cancer burden shifted from high to low SDI countries (CI: 0.05 to -0.10, SII: 31.00 to -35.50), while the tobacco-attributable burden persisted in higher SDI countries, albeit with diminishing inequalities (CI: 0.34 to 0.25, SII: 572.20 to 304.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date study provides a comprehensive perspective on air fine particulate matter and tobacco smoke exposure's impact on lung cancer burden, highlighting its widespread nature, substantial impact, unequal distribution, and preventability. The findings call for targeted interventions and global cooperation across socioeconomic levels to reduce the overall lung cancer burden in the post-pandemic era."

            "abstract": "The complex pathogenic relationships between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its usually associated comorbidities remain poorly understood. While evidence suggests that some comorbidities may directly influence the development or progression of IPF or vice versa, whether these associations are causal or arise independently due to shared risk factors, such as aging, smoking, lifestyle, and genetic susceptibility, is still uncertain. Some comorbidities, such as metabolic syndromes, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, precede the development of IPF. In contrast, others, like pulmonary hypertension or lung cancer, often become apparent after its onset or during its progression. These timing patterns suggest a directional relationship in their associations. The issue is further complicated by the fact that patients often have multiple comorbidities, which may interact and exacerbate one another, creating a vicious cycle. To clarify these correlations, some studies have used causal inference methods (e.g., Mendelian randomisation) and exploration of underlying mechanisms; however, these efforts have not yet generated conclusive insights. In this review, we provide a general overview of the relationship between IPF and its comorbidities, emphasizing the pathogenic mechanisms underlying each comorbidity, potential shared pathobiology with IPF, and, when available, causal insights from Mendelian randomisation studies."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While traditionally associated with older adults, early-onset lung cancer (EOLC) is rising, particularly in Asia, which accounts for 75.9% of global cases. Existing lung cancer screening guidelines primarily focus on older populations, which may result in missed opportunities for early detection in younger individuals. Given its distinct clinical characteristics, EOLC warrants dedicated research and targeted interventions.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize the lipidomic profiles specific to EOLC patients (aged 18-49\u202fyears) and develop a biomarker-based predictive model to improve risk assessment and early detection.\nMETHODS: The discovery and validation sets included 111 EOLC cases and 127 non-EOLC controls, all aged 18-49\u202fyears. Targeted lipidomics analysis, combined with logistic regression, was performed on plasma samples to identify differentially expressed lipids species. Clustering and pathway analyses were conducted to uncover and visualize the internal signatures of the identified lipids. Key lipids were refined using the LASSO-bootstrap regression method combined with the Boruta algorithm. A random forest model was subsequently employed to develop a robust prediction model for EOLC.\nRESULTS: A total of 843 lipids were identified, with 60 differentially expressed lipids detected, of which 33 were validated in the validation set. Cluster analysis revealed that passive smoking (OR: 3.11, 95% CI: 0.97-12.11) and current smoking (OR: 15.65, 95% CI: 2.55-142.10) were associated with elevated lipid metabolite profiles in EOLC patients. The validated lipids were further refined using LASSO and Boruta methods, which ultimately selected 6 lipids for inclusion in a prediction model constructed with random forest. This model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.874 in the validation set.\nCONCLUSION: Our study identified lipidomic signatures associated with the risk of EOLC, offering potential translational implications for lung cancer prevention strategies."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to cooking fumes exposure likely increases the lung cancer risk in school cooks, but research on the incidence of lung cancer in school cooks is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to examine a nationwide cohort of school cooks for lung cancer by linking three Korean social insurance databases to determine whether working as a school cook increases lung cancer risk.\nMETHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of school cooks and clerks with lung cancer was established by linking Employment Insurance, Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance, and National Health Insurance Service databases. Covariates were matched using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) for school cooks and clerks. Age-standardized incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for lung cancer were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Fine-Gray subdistribution HRs were used for sensitivity analysis. After further categorization into never- and ever-smoked subcohorts, the same analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: Post PSM, we identified 76 cases of lung cancer in school cooks during 259,819 person-years of follow-up. The age-standardized incidence was 199.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 120.7-278.9) and 166.8 (95% CI: 95.8-237.7) for school cooks and clerks, respectively. The subdistribution HR for school cooks post PSM was 1.72 (95% CI: 1.14-2.60). In the never-smoked subcohort, the subdistribution HR\u00a0for school cooks post PSM was 4.23 (95% CI: 2.36-7.58).\nCONCLUSION: School cooks were at an elevated risk of developing lung cancer, likely due to exposure to cooking fumes, highlighting the need for improved ventilation and preventive measures in school kitchens to reduce lung cancer risk."

            "title": "The inflammation burden index can predict the cardiac injury following antitumour therapy in lung cancer patients with diabetes.",
            "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diabetes, as a common metabolic disorder, further increases the risk of cardiovascular damage. Studies have shown that myocardial cells in diabetic patients are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of cancer treatments, thereby raising the risk of heart failure. Therefore, cardiovascular risk assessment in lung cancer patients with diabetes is particularly important. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) is a biomarker that reflects systemic inflammation, combining the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, and lymphocytes. It has been shown to be a significant prognostic indicator in various cancer populations. This study aims to investigate the predictive ability of IBI and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index for cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. A single-center retrospective case-control study was conducted, including clinical data of 192 lung cancer patients with diabetes who received anti-tumor therapy from July 2018 to January 2023.Cardiac injury was assessed by measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels. The Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) was calculated using the formula: IBI = (C-reactive protein [CRP] \u00d7 Neutrophils)/Lymphocytes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between clinical factors, IBI, TyG index, and cardiac injury. The clinical predictive value of these factors was further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the relationship between IBI and cardiac injury was explored using the Restricted Cubic Spline (RCS) model. In the 192 patients, 101 (52.6%) developed cardiac injury during follow-up. Univariate analysis showed that age, male, hypertension, smoking, D-dimer, CKMB, IBI, TNM stage: III/IV, and Immunotherapy were significantly associated with cardiac injury (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified IBI (P\u2009=\u20090.007), age (P\u2009=\u20090.01), smoking (P\u2009<\u20090.001), CKMB (P\u2009<\u20090.001), TNM stage (P\u2009=\u20090.014), and hypertension (P\u2009=\u20090.007) as independent predictors of cardiac injury. ROC analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.722 for IBI (cut-off: 8.408), indicating good predictive value. RCS analysis showed a significant nonlinear positive correlation between IBI and cardiac injury (P\u2009=\u20090.0079), with the risk of cardiac injury increasing significantly as IBI levels rose. The TyG index was not significantly associated with cardiac injury. IBI, as a simple and accessible biomarker, can effectively predict cardiac injury in lung cancer patients with diabetes undergoing antitumor therapy. Although the TyG index did not show a significant association with cardiac injury in this study, IBI demonstrated strong predictive ability in this patient group. Future studies should further validate the use of IBI across different cancer types and evaluate its prognostic role in long-term follow-up."

NHMs have been increasingly used to inform public health policies, highlighting their utility. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize existing LC NHMs, identify their limitations, and propose a framework for future NHM development.\nMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore from their inception to October 5, 2023, for peer-reviewed, full-length articles with an LC NHM. Model characteristics, their applications, data sources used, and limitations were extracted and narratively synthesized.\nRESULTS: From 238 publications, 69 publications were included in our review, corresponding to 22 original LC NHMs and 47 model applications. The majority of the models (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 68\u00a0%) used a microsimulation approach. NHM parameters were predominately informed by cancer registries, trial and institutional data, and literature. Model quality and performance were evaluated in 8 (36 %) models. Twenty (91\u00a0%) models included at least one carcinogenesis risk factor-primarily age, sex, and smoking history. Three (14\u00a0%) LC NHMs modeled progression in never-smokers; one (5\u00a0%) addressed recurrence. Non-tobacco smoking, nodule type, and biomarker expression were not considered in existing NHMs. Based on our findings, we proposed a framework for future LC NHM development which incorporates recurrence, nodule type differentiation, biomarker expression levels, biological factors, and non-smoking-related risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: Regular updating and future research are warranted to address limitations in existing NHMs thereby ensuring relevance and accuracy of modeling approaches in the evolving LC landscape."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To quantify, after extending follow-up 15\u202fyears, the relationship between occupational respirable crystalline silica (RCS) exposure and risk of silicosis diagnosis and lung cancer mortality in the German Porcelain Workers Cohort Study, and to estimate possible exposure thresholds for these.\nMETHODS: Porcelain workers enrolled between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1987, in a mandatory medical surveillance program including triennial chest x-rays and alive at the end of the previous study follow-up (2005) were followed through December 2020, for lung cancer mortality and silicosis incidence. Cause of death was determined from death certificates. Silicosis cases were identified by re-reading x-rays of individuals remaining in the medical surveillance program or filing insurance claims for silicosis. RCS exposure was estimated for each cohort member using a job exposure matrix (JEM) based on about 8,000 historical industrial hygiene RCS measurements. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by cumulative and average exposure groups, controlling for age, sex, smoking status and employment duration. Exposure-response analyses were performed to identify possible exposure thresholds for lung cancer and silicosis risk.\nRESULTS: Total deaths increased from 1,610 (9.1%) to 4,586 (26%) over 537,129 total person-years at risk. All-cause mortality was elevated among men (SMR\u202f=\u202f1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.14); however, a deficit was seen among women (SMR\u202f=\u202f0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98). No statistically significantly increased mortality was seen due to lung cancer, renal cancer, or non-malignant renal disease - conditions reportedly associated with RCS exposure. Lung cancer mortality was unrelated to RCS exposure level. However, for silicosis cases classified using International Labor Organization (ILO) categories \u22651/1 or 1/0, risk was strongly associated with estimated average exposure &gt;0.10\u202fmg/m3 and 0.15\u202fmg/m3, and cumulative exposure &gt;3.0\u202fmg/m3-years and\u202f&gt;\u202f1.0\u202fmg/m3-years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the large number (n\u202f=\u202f284) of lung cancer deaths and high historical RCS exposures, no excess risk and no relationship with exposure level were seen. However, RCS exposure was strongly associated with silicosis risk, with clear exposure thresholds. This study further confirms the lack of increased lung cancer risk at RCS levels historically prevalent in the German porcelain industry and that exposures exceeding estimated thresholds clearly increased silicosis risk. Occupational exposure levels in the German porcelain industry in recent decades have remained well below these thresholds; therefore, few additional silicosis cases are expected."

            "abstract": "Smoking has been identified as a major risk factor for the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a key component of tobacco smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the development of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic strategies."

We leverage survey and electronic health record data from the diverse All of Us Research Program (AoURP) database to investigate whether smoking and smoking-related behaviors increase the risk of lung metastasis in non-lung primary cancers. The results suggest that cigarette use, measured by four continuous variables, does not increase the risk of lung metastasis in seven common cancer types but demonstrates a small significant effect in a cohort including all types of cancer in the database in both univariable and multivariable analyses. An increased odds ratio of electronic smoke use in patients with lung metastasis was seen in multivariable analyses of the all cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04-1.59, P\u2009=\u20090.02) and liver cancer (OR\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.06-2.28, P\u2009=\u20090.02) groups.

This study explored the VTE risk factors and established a machine-learning model to predict a failure of postoperative thromboprophylaxis.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery between January 2018 and November 2022. The patients were randomized 7:3 to the training and test sets. Nine machine learning models were constructed. The three most predictive machine-learning classifiers were chosen as the first layer of the stacking machine-learning model, and logistic regression was the second layer of the meta-learning model.\nRESULTS: This study included 362 patients, including 58 (16.0%) with VTE. Based on the multivariable logistic regression analysis, age, platelets, D-dimers, albumin, smoking history, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 21 mutation were used to develop the nine machine-learning models. LGBM Classifier, RandomForest Classifier, and GNB were chosen for the first layer of the stacking machine learning model. The area under the received operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the stacking machine learning model in the training/test set were 0.984/0.979, 0.949/0.954, 0.935/1.000, and 0.958/0.887, respectively. In the validation set, the final stacking machine learning model demonstrated an ROC AUC of 0.983, accuracy of 0.937, sensitivity of 0.978, and specificity of 0.947.

            "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 susceptibility loci for lung cancer, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain largely unknown, particularly for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Here, we integrated data from 3890 LUSC cases and 13328 controls of Chinese descent, and performed a conditional analysis to explore independent genetic variants and analyzed the interaction between the genetic variants and smoking. Our study was the first to identify a specific association between genetic variants in the 9q33.2 region and increased risk of LUSC in smokers. After adjusting for the tag SNP rs4573350 in 9q33.2, no additional significant genetic variants were found. However, significant additive (RERI=1.66, 95%CI: 1.17-2.22, AP=0.26, 95%CI: 0.19-0.33) and multiple interactions (OR=1.30, 95%CI: 1.08-1.56, P=5.40\u00d710-3) were observed between rs4573350 and smoking. Compared to nonsmokers with the CC genotype, smokers with the CT/TT genotype showed an increased risk of 6.29-fold (95%CI: 5.46-7.23, P=2.00\u00d710-16). Functional annotation identified rs4573350 as the strongest functional variant within the linkage disequilibrium block. Biological experiments confirmed that the combined exposure to the T allele of rs4573350 and cigarette smoke extract promotes the expression of the ZBTB26 by modulating the binding ability of the transcription factor FOXA1. Furthermore, ZBTB26 was found to regulate tumorigenesis of LUSC both in vitro and in vivo by affecting the expression of PCNA, which is involved in cell cycle and promotes tumorigenesis of LUSC."

This review provides a high-level overview of the associations between outdoor and indoor air pollution and cancer risk and outcomes. Outdoor air pollutants are largely due to the burning of fossil fuels from human activities, although there is growing data implicating outdoor pollution from wildfire smoke. Indoor air pollution is primarily caused by burning solid fuel sources such as wood, coal and charcoal for household cooking and heating. There is a growing number of pieces of evidence linking exposure to pollution and the risk of developing cancers. The strongest evidence is seen on the positive association of air pollution, particularly particulate matter 2.5 with lung cancer. Emerging data implicate exposure to pollutants in the development of breast, gastrointestinal and other cancers. The mechanisms underlying these associations include oxidative stress, inflammation and direct DNA damage facilitated by pollutant absorption and distribution in the body. References were identified through a PubMed search for articles published in 2000 to October 2024 using the terms 'air pollution' or 'pollutants' and 'carcinoma' or ''cancer'. Air pollution poses significant risks to health. Its health impacts, including cancer risks, are often underestimated. Hazardous pollutants have been studied in several epidemiological cohort studies. Despite the mounting evidence, air pollution is often overlooked in predictive cancer risk models and public health intervention."

Eligible observational studies on WPS and health outcomes were selected through a duplicate, independent process. Data extraction, including study details, participant characteristics, methods, and results, was performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), and studies were classified as high, moderate, or poor quality. The GRADE approach was applied to evaluate evidence certainty for each outcome, considering factors such as study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, and publication bias.\nRESULTS: A total of 191 studies with 807,174 participants were included, comprising 98 case-control, 77 cross-sectional, and 16 cohort studies from 24 countries. The median number of studies analyzed per outcome was 5, with a range of 3 to 30. Among the 62 outcomes evaluated, 31 (50%) demonstrated statistically significant effect sizes based on a random-effects model, with stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cancer mortality exhibiting a significant prediction interval. Credibility evaluations identified low-quality evidence for birth weight, CAD, and cardiovascular and cancer mortality, whereas the evidence for the remaining outcomes was graded as very low quality. Significant associations were found between WPS and several health outcomes: gastric cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, CAD, stroke, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, infertility, sperm normal form, sperm DNA fragmentation, chronic bronchitis, cough, sputum, low birth weight (LBW), spirometry parameters, and several dental health indicators.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals strong links between WPS and adverse health outcomes, but low evidence quality calls for rigorous research and public health interventions to mitigate its effects."

Prior research has shown that exposure of the airway epithelium to cigarette smoke results in epithelial gene expression alterations throughout the respiratory tree that reflect the risk of lung cancer in a pulmonary nodule. The PNS classifier leverages this concept using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) of cells collected from the nasal epithelium and provides \"high\", \"intermediate\" and \"low risk\" classification calls to help guide clinical management decisions. The clinical validity of the PNS test was established on an independent validation set and demonstrated favorable sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to evaluate the analytical validity of the PNS test performance in our CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) laboratory.\nMETHODS: The reproducibility between RNASeq runs within a laboratory and the accuracy between laboratories were estimated and compared against the performance-based acceptance criterion. The impacts from varying RNA input amount, genomic DNA and blood RNA interference were evaluated to demonstrate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the PNS test results to known conditions that may occur in routine laboratory processing.\nRESULTS: Based on modeling the impact on clinical sensitivity/specificity, PNS test classifier scores can allow up to 0.776 score units of added noise/variability before any performance metrics drop below the pre-specified requirements. This allowable variability is six-fold higher than the observed variability estimated between runs and between laboratories under routine testing conditions, which are each less than 2% of the 98th percentile score range. In addition, PNS test results are shown to be robust against RNA input variation from 50 ng to 15 ng, up to 30% of genomic DNA by nucleic mass interference, and up to 14% of blood RNA interference.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provided sufficient evidence for the accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the PNS molecular test and supported its utilization in clinical testing."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with an incidence of 4.7 cases per 100\u202f000 individuals in 2021 in the US and a 5-year overall survival of 12% to 30%.\nOBSERVATIONS: Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor for development of SCLC, as 95% of patients diagnosed with SCLC have a history of tobacco use. Patients with SCLC may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough (40%), shortness of breath (34%), hemoptysis (10%), or metastases with corresponding local symptoms (30%) such as pleuritis or bone pain; approximately 60% of patients with SCLC may be asymptomatic at diagnosis. Chest imaging may demonstrate central hilar (85%) or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (75%). At diagnosis, approximately 15% of patients have brain metastases, which may present as headache or focal weakness. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy of a primary lung mass, thoracic lymph node, or metastatic lesion. Small cell lung cancer is classified into limited stage (LS-SCLC; 30%) vs extensive stage (ES-SCLC; 70%) based on whether the disease can be treated within a radiation field that is typically confined to 1 hemithorax but may include contralateral mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes. For patients with LS-SCLC, surgery or concurrent chemotherapy with platinum-etoposide and radiotherapy is potentially curative in 30% of patients. More recently, median survival for LS-SCLC has reached up to 55.9 months with the addition of durvalumab, an immunotherapy. First-line treatment for ES-SCLC is combined treatment with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy and immunotherapy with the programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors durvalumab or atezolizumab followed by maintenance immunotherapy until disease progression or toxicity. Although initial rates of tumor shrinkage are 60% to 70% with platinum-etoposide and immunotherapy treatment, the median overall survival of patients treated for ES-SCLC is approximately 12 to 13 months, with 60% of patients relapsing within 3 months. Second-line therapy for patients with ES-SCLC includes the DNA-alkylating agent lurbinectedin (35% overall response rate; median progression-free survival, 3.7 months) and a bispecific T-cell engager against delta-like ligand 3, tarlatamab (40% overall response rate; median progression-free survival, 4.9 months).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Small cell lung cancer is a smoking-related malignancy that presents at an advanced stage in 70% of patients. Three-year overall survival is approximately 56.5% for LS-SCLC and 17.6% for ES-SCLC. First-line treatment for LS-SCLC is radiation targeting the tumor given concurrently with chemotherapy and followed by consolidation immunotherapy. For ES-SCLC, first-line treatment is chemotherapy and immunotherapy followed by maintenance immunotherapy."

Despite the population impact, its risk factors are poorly understood owing to a dearth of larger-scale, well-characterised studies.\nMETHODS: We pooled individual-participant data from 18 prospective cohort studies comprising 91,588 never smokers (55,452 women) aged 16-102 years at study induction. Participants were linked to national death registries.\nRESULTS: A maximum of 17 years follow-up (mean 9.7) gave rise to 85 lung cancer deaths. Of the 19 potential determinants captured at baseline, only being older age (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval per 10 year increase: 2.45; 2.11, 2.85), male (2.25; 1.46, 3.48), and having a high fruit and vegetable intake (2.29; 1.25, 4.17) were associated with elevated rates of lung cancer in this never-smoking group. No other substantial relationships were detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the number and breadth of potential risk factors featured in this multi-cohort study, there was no clear suggestion of new determinants of lung cancer in never-smokers.\nIMPACT: Our findings point to the need to explore the influence of risk factors additional to those included herein, particular in the field of genetics. Our unlikely finding for fruit and vegetable consumption warrants further testing."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Secondhand smoke (SHS) has long been identified as a significant risk factor for lung cancer, yet the precise magnitude of its contribution to the global lung cancer burden remains unclear. Our study aims to elucidate the harms associated with lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke while emphasizing the importance of avoiding SHS.\nMETHODS: The annual deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 for this secondary dataset analysis. Trends in mortality and DALYs were evaluated, along with correlations with the sociodemographic index (SDI). Projections from 2021 to 2036 utilized a Bayesian age-period-cohort model.\nRESULTS: In 1990, SHS-related lung cancer was responsible for approximately 0.058 million deaths and 1.599 million DALYs, globally. By 2021, these numbers had increased to approximately 0.098 million deaths and 2.356 million DALYs worldwide. Between 1990 and 2021, SHS-related lung cumulatively caused 2.428 million deaths and 62.785 million DALYs. From 1990 to 2021, deaths and DALYs increased significantly, while age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) decreased. Specifically, ASMR decreased from 1.45 to 1.14, and ASDR dropped from 38.40 to 26.93. The high-middle SDI region bore the largest burden, accounting for nearly 40% of global deaths and DALYs. East Asia held the highest burden of lung cancer attributable to secondhand smoke in 2021, while Oceania had the lowest burden. Projections suggest that male ASMR will decline to 1.18 by 2036, while female ASMR is expected to rise to 0.91 by 2029 before decreasing to 0.89 by 2036.\nCONCLUSIONS: The considerable burden of lung cancer attributable to secondhand smoke underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions, particularly in high-risk demographics and regions. To mitigate disparities and enhance global health outcomes, it is crucial to prioritize the avoidance of SHS and the establishment of smoke-free environments."

            "abstract": "Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth. In a landscape analysis of 1024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUAD that displayed diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed an interplay between mobile elements, endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, distinct driver genes, and epidemiological features. Our results revealed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry, and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G&gt;A:T driver mutations in KRAS plus short subclonal diversification. LUAD in never smokers showed early occurrence of copy number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumors harboring EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in females of European-ancestry (EU_N). In EU_N, EGFR mutations preceded the occurrence of other driver genes, including TP53 and RBM10. Tumors from Asian never smokers showed a short clonal evolution and presented with heterogeneous repetitive patterns for the inferred mutational order. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID2 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumors with ID2 showed short latency and high L1 retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumors exhibited an aggressive phenotype, characterized by increased genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low burden of neoantigens, propensity to develop metastasis, and poor overall survival. Reactivated L1 retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis can contribute to the origin of the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans."

            "abstract": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the standard treatment for patients who are medically inoperable or who refuse surgery with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While acute lymphopenia following SBRT is documented, the long-term effects on the immune system and infectious disease remain unclear. In this report, we present two cases of chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis (CPPA) occurring within the irradiated field following SBRT for inoperable stage I NSCLC. Case 1 was a man in his 70\u00a0s with a history of smoking and a previous pulmonary resection and SBRT for metachronous primary lung cancer. He received SBRT for T1aN0M0 NSCLC in the right lower lobe as his third primary lung cancer. After 20\u00a0months, the patient developed a cough and sputum, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a cavity shadow in the irradiated field, which led to the diagnosis of CPPA. Intravenous voriconazole was immediately started, and after 3\u00a0week's administration, the symptoms improved, and the cavity disappeared. After 34\u00a0months, the patient died with no recurrence of CPPA and lung cancer. Case 2 was a man in his 80\u00a0s with a history of smoking and previous pulmonary resection for lung cancer. He received SBRT for T1cN0M0 NSCLC in the right lower lobe as his second primary lung cancer. After 19\u00a0months, the patient developed a fever, and a CT scan revealed a cavity shadow in the irradiated field, which led to the diagnosis of CPPA. Oral itraconazole was administered, followed by diarrhea and anorexia. After 22\u00a0days, the patient died. During the follow-up period, there was no recurrence of lung cancer. Risk factors for CPPA include a history of smoking and lung resection, common among candidates for pulmonary SBRT. When a cavity shadow develops following SBRT, differentiating consolidation as radiation pneumonitis, local recurrence, or infection can be challenging. When a cavity is identified on a follow-up CT scan after SBRT, it is crucial to include CPPA in the differential diagnosis."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple and practical model to predict the prognostic survival of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma by combining general pathological information with laboratory hematologic indicators.\nMETHODS: Cox univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the variable indicators. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed based on the selected variables to compare survival outcomes between the high-and low-risk groups of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma and to validate the model's performance. Subsequently, a nomogram model was established to systematically evaluate the impact of selected variables on prognosis.\nRESULTS: Data of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma from four hospitals were retrospectively collected. We enrolled 1,172 patients, this includes 372 external validation data. Multivariate analysis identified six significant variables (P &lt; 0.05): tumor TNM stage, tumor size, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, and hemoglobin level. We combined these six variables to build a model. The C-index of the training set is 0.811 (0.780-0.842), this value is 0.786 (0.737-0.835) in,test set and 0.810 (0.772-0.847) in validation set. The area under the curve (AUC) results of the predicted 3-years overall survival (OS) of the three data sets were 0.850, 0.819, and 0.860, respectively. These values for 5-years were 0.811, 0.771, and 0.849. Stratified analysis based on tumor staging showed that the model effectively distinguished outcomes (P &lt; 0.0001). High-risk groups demonstrated significantly poorer prognosis compared to low-risk groups (P &lt; 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The prognostic model based on tumor TNM stage, tumor size, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, and hemoglobin levels effectively predicted the prognosis of non-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Compared with the more studied blood markers at present, the indicators of our model do not need conversion, Our model provides a useful reference for personalized diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice."

Given the possible links between diabetes, smoking, and respiratory diseases, this study aims to examine the interaction patterns among factors associated with the risk of lung cancer among diabetes patients. A territory-wide retrospective cohort study was performed using electronic health records of Hong Kong. Patients who received diabetes care in general outpatient clinics between 2010 and 2019 without cancer history were included and followed up until December 2019. Conditional inference survival tree was applied to examine the interaction patterns among factors associated with the risk of lung cancer. A total of 385,521 patients were included. During a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 3395 developed lung cancer. Age emerged as primary factor in differentiating the risk of lung cancer. Conditional on age (\u2009\u2264\u200964 vs >64 years), smoking appeared as subsequent dominant risk factor within each subpopulation. Among old smokers aged >64 years characterized by long duration of diabetes (median: 6-8 years), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emerged as key risk factor. Six distinct subgroups of diabetes patients with different risk levels of lung cancer according to age, smoking, metformin use, and COPD status were identified. Findings of the study suggest the interaction patterns among age, smoking, and COPD on the risk of lung cancer among diabetes patients, providing targets for public health interventions."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reliable epidemiological data are limited on the lung cancer risk of groups using e-cigarettes (ECIGs) and groups using heated tobacco products (HTPs).\nAIM: We describe a methodology to estimate the lung cancer risk of these groups according to their levels of biomarkers of exposure (BOEs) and of potential harm (BOPHs).\nMETHODS: Using 28 search terms for BOEs and 82 for BOPHs we sought publications reporting biomarker-specific data from North America and Europe comparing individuals who smoke cigarettes and individuals who use other established products (ETPs; cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco (ST) and/or snuff/snus). Publications were selected using defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Additionally using lung cancer relative risk (RR) estimates for users of specific ETPs derived from recent meta-analyses of epidemiological studies in these regions, we derived a regression model predicting the lung cancer RR by level of each specific biomarker. Separately for groups using ECIGs and using HTPs the lung cancer risk was then estimated by combining RR estimates for selected biomarkers. Our primary estimates only considered biomarkers statistically significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.01) related to lung cancer risk which showed no significant (p\u2009<\u20090.01) misfit to the RR of 1.0 for non-users-those with no use of ETPs, ECIGs or HTPs.\nRESULTS: Based on 38 available publications, we extracted biomarker-specific data for ETPs for 56 BOEs within 21 of the 28 search terms considered and for 54 BOPHs within 29 of the 82. The regression slope fitted to the lung cancer risk was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.01) for 22 BOEs and six BOPHs. However, the predicted RR for non-users significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.01) differed from 1.0 for 16 of these biomarkers. We estimated the lung cancer RR for using ECIGs, derived from 30 estimates for 10 biomarkers, as 1.88 (95% CI 1.60-2.22), the excess risk (ER\u2009=\u2009RR\u2009-\u20091) being 6.8% of that for smokers of cigarettes. The RR estimate varied little in most sensitivity analyses conducted, but increased markedly after removing the restriction to significant model fit. We estimated the lung cancer RR for using HTPs, combining estimates for four BOEs, as 1.44 (0.41-5.08), the ER being 3.4% of that for smokers of cigarettes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite some methodological limitations, our approach estimates risk when reliable epidemiological data are unavailable. Using the biomarkers considered here, the model indicates that the lung cancer risk for individuals using ECIGs is much lower than for smokers of cigarettes, and suggests that the risk for those using HTPs is also low. Research using additional data could add precision to these findings."

Methods: We conducted a respective analysis of the clinical, pathological, and follow-up data of 12 recipients who developed lung cancer in the native lung after single-lung transplantation at China-Japan Friendship Hospital from September 2017 to June 2021, among a total of 247 single-lung transplantations performed during this period. Eleven were male and 1 was female, with ages ranging from 46-67 (59.25\u00b15.75) years. Results: Of the 12 recipients, 11 had a smoking history before transplantation. The underlying diagnosis of lung diseases before transplantation included 8 cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 3 cases of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease, and 1 case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The time interval from transplantation to the development of lung cancer in the native lung was 3 to 53 months, with an average of (30.0\u00b116.2) months. Eleven patients had elevated levels of serum tumor markers at the time of lung cancer diagnosis. CT/PET-CT showed new nodules or FDG avidity in the native lung. The histological types of lung cancer in the 12 cases included 1 case of small cell carcinoma and 11 cases of non-small cell lung cancer (7 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 3 cases of adenocarcinoma, and 1 case of SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated carcinoma). There were 8 cases in clinical stage \u2163, 1 case in stage \u2162, and 3 cases in stage\u2160. Three patients in stage \u2160 and one patient in stage \u2162 underwent surgical treatment, while patients in stage \u2163 were treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and palliative care. At the end of this study, 10 patients had died, 1 patient survived, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The median survival time was 7 months (ranging from 2 to 47 months), and the 1-year cumulative survival rate was 9.2%. Conclusions: The risk of developing lung cancer in the native lung after single lung transplantation is increased. The prognosis is very poor. Most of the histological types are squamous cell carcinoma. Close monitoring of high-risk populations after transplantation for early tumor detection may prolong survival time."

However, U.S. LCS rates from different studies have been inconsistent, and limited data are available for trend analysis.\nMETHODS: Using LCS data from the 2020 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2022-2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we estimated recent LCS rates among eligible adults. We also analyzed data from previous years to examine trends from 2010 to 2023.\nRESULTS: Based on NHIS data, an estimated 8,247,101 (95% CI: 7,634,267-8,859,936) U.S. adults were eligible for LCS in 2020 per the 2013 USPSTF criteria. A similar number (8,039,236) were estimated in 2022 from BRFSS using the same eligibility criteria, with an additional 5,364,797 newly eligible individuals based on expanded 2021 USPSTF criteria. LCS rates based on the 2013 criteria increased significantly from 3.8% in 2010 to 15.9% in 2020 (NHIS data), and to 21.8% in 2022 (BRFSS data). However, the 2022 screening rate among the newly eligible population (13.0%) was lower than that of individuals eligible under the 2013 criteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: The 2020 NHIS estimates contributed to understanding trends in LCS rates, while indicating that the Healthy People 2030 target of 7.5% of eligible screened would benefit from reassessment. Despite significant increases over the past decade, overall LCS rates remain low, and further research is needed to better understand the modest U.S. uptake of lung cancer screening."

Family relationships (from Multigeneration register) and diagnosed cancers (from Cancer registry) were obtained from the national registers from 1961 to 2021. The overall familial risk for LC was constant from the 1990s but the male familial risk decreased while the female familial risk doubled at the same time when female incidence doubled. The female familial risk for mother-daughter pairs was higher (SIR\u2009=\u20092.2 [2.0-2.3], N\u2009=\u2009716) than for father-son pairs (SIR\u2009=\u20091.6 [1.5-1.8], N\u2009=\u2009962). The histology-specific familial risks for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell and large cell carcinoma were highest for concordant histology but also present for discordant histology. The number of family members diagnosed with LC was a strong determinant of familial risk. The novel results showed that familial risk of LC depends on the background incidence of LC and is higher for women compared to men. We demonstrated further an increased familial risk for each of the four histological types of LC which was higher for concordant than discordant histologies but was even detected between discordant histologies suggesting that LC histology is not a genetic trait."

Nearly 53,000 new cases were expected in France in 2023, representing 12% of all new cases of cancer, and 33,000 deaths were reported in 2018, representing 21% of all cancer deaths. The KBP studies conducted by the College of General Hospital Pulmonologists (CPHG) for 20 years constitute an excellent barometer of the evolution of the Lung Cancer in France. Lung Cancer is becoming more feminine but still remains a male cancer with a narrowing gap between the two sexes: 65,4% of incident cases are men in the overall population in 2020 but only 58,9% among young subjects (<50 years old). The average age at diagnosis is increasing (67.8 years). The most common histological subtype is adenocarcinoma. Smoking remains the main risk factor but the proportion of non-smokers is increasing (12,6%) due to the impact of air pollution, passive smoking and the aging of the population. The impact of COVID-19 on Lung Cancer mortality in 2020 was significant.

Despite the implementation of LC screening programs worldwide, recruitment is challenging. While recruitment for LC screening is based on physician referrals and mass advertising, novel recruitment strategies are needed to improve the enrollment of high-risk individuals into LC screening.\nOBJECTIVE: We aim to identify whether patients with LC can act as advocates to enroll their family members and close contacts into LC screening and whether this strategy increases screening uptake at the population level.\nMETHODS: We designed a prospective cohort study comprising 2 cohorts constituted between June 2023 and January 2024 with a prospective follow-up of 18 months. Patients with LC (cohort 1) are approached at clinics of the McGill University Health Centre, educated on tools for communicating with family members and close contacts about the benefits of LC screening, and invited to refer their close ones. Referred individuals (cohort 2) are directed to this study's web-based questionnaire to assess their LC risk score with the PLCOm2012 (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial) prediction model. Individuals meeting the eligibility criteria for LC screening (PLCOm2012 score \u22652% and aged 55-74 years) are directed toward the Quebec LC screening program. Data collected include sociodemographic characteristics, health literacy and smoking status (all participants), patient activation (cohort 1), perceived risk of LC, and generalized anxiety at baseline and at 28 days (cohort 2). LDCT completion within 18 months from referral is assessed from health records. Focus groups will identify the barriers and facilitators in the uptake of LC screening and preventative behaviors based on perceived genetic and clinical LC risks. The primary outcomes are the number of referred participants per survivor of LC and the mean risk of LC of the referred population based on PLCOm2012 scores. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of (1) participants eligible for LC screening; (2) participants eligible for screening who complete LDCT screening within 18 months of referral from a survivor of LC; (3) participants showing interest in genetic testing to inform LC risk; and (4) participants showing interest in a smoking cessation program. Multivariable logistic regression will identify the predictive factors of being referred for LC screening. PLCOm2012 scores will be compared for referred participants and controls from the provincial LC screening program.\nRESULTS: Overall, 25 survivors of LC and 84 close contacts were enrolled from June 2023 to January 2024, with followed up through July 2025. The results are expected by the end of 2025.\nCONCLUSIONS: We describe an approach to LC screening referral, leveraging patients with LC as advocates to increase screening awareness and uptake among their family and peers.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05645731; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05645731.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/58529."

Average annual percentage change (AAPC) was examined using joinpoint regression.\nRESULTS: Among 102\u202f710 deaths in Washington, DC (51\u202f712 among males [50.3%], 26\u202f100 among individuals aged \u226585 years [25.4%]; 82\u202f308 among Black [80.1%] and 20\u202f402 among White [19.9%] individuals), CVD (33\u202f254 deaths [32.4%]) and cancer (22\u202f677 deaths [22.1%]) accounted for more than half of deaths. All-cause mortality declined between 2000 and 2012 (AAPC, -2.6%; 95% CI, -4.5% to -1.9%), stagnated between 2012 and 2018, and increased between 2018 and 2020 (AAPC, 10.9%; 95% CI. 3.8% to 15.1%). CVD mortality declined between 2000 and 2011 (AAPC, -3.1%; 95% CI, -4.3% to -2.4%) and plateaued thereafter in the Black population, contrasting with the monotonic decline in the White population from 2000 to 2020 (AAPC, -4.7%; 95% CI, -5.3% to -4.1%), for a magnification of disparities from 2000 (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.7) to 2020 (RR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.3). Cancer mortality decreased from 2000 to 2020 but with a greater magnitude in the White (AAPC, -3.4%; 95% CI, -3.9% to -2.9%) than Black (AAPC, -1.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to -1.4%) population (RR for 2000, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.8 and RR for 2020, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.4). Risk factors were consistently more prevalent in the Black than White population (eg, hypertension: RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.7 in 2001 and 2.3; 95% CI, 1.9-2.6 in 2019). Disparities as assessed by RRs increased for smoking (AAPC, 4.3%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 5.6%), decreased for obesity (AAPC, -1.2%; 95% CI, -1.9% to -0.4%), and remained constant for diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, all-cause, age-adjusted mortality was higher in the Black than White population, racial disparities worsened for CVD and cancer, and CVD risk factors were more prevalent in the Black population, underscoring the urgent need for precision public health interventions tailored toward high-risk populations."

            "abstract": "The population of cancer survivors is increasing rapidly in the UK. Little is known about the variation in comorbidity and mortality by ethnicity and socio-economic condition in this population. This study explores these variations using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and linked secondary care data. The prevalence of multimorbidity and risk of mortality were calculated for Asian, Black, and Other ethnic and socio-economic groups in England, consisting of 333,226 cancer survivors across 28 cancer types. Odds ratios and hazard ratios were calculated using the White and most affluent groups as references and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. Stratified mortality analysis was conducted for survivors of the six common cancers in the UK: breast, prostate, colorectal, bladder, cervical, and lung. Compared to White cancer survivors, survivors of all other ethnic groups had a statistically significant higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (Asian adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.61 (4.02-5.28), Black OR 1.87 (1.52-2.30), and Other OR 2.06 (1.64-2.59)). However, they had lower prevalences of depression and anxiety. Asian survivors exhibited the highest overall prevalence of comorbidity. Black survivors had the worst survival (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.48 (1.38-1.59)) for all cancers combined, as well as for breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancers. Black breast cancer survivors face a particularly high mortality risk (HR 1.78 (1.52-2.10)) compared to Whites. Asian survivors had higher mortality for all cancers combined (HR 1.31 (1.23-1.39)) and specifically for lung cancer (HR 1.81 (1.44-2.28)). The Other ethnic group had a significantly increased risk of mortality in cervical cancer (HR 1.90 (1.19-3.03)). The risk of mortality increased with worse socio-economic conditions, regardless of ethnic group. Cancer survivors of non-White ethnicity and poorer socio-economic background in the UK have worse outcomes in terms of increased prevalence of multimorbidity and mortality compared to White survivors. These findings indicate the need to comprehend the underlying reasons for these disparities and to assess the implications for cancer services, patient experience, and overall outcomes."

            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Despite recent lung cancer screening (LCS) studies proving significant mortality reduction, comorbidities are a prominent issue affecting cost effectiveness, which is holding back national implementation. Incidental findings (IFs) of comorbidities make a significant contribution to delayed diagnoses and raise discussions about optimal management plans. This is particularly relevant to national lung cancer screening (NLCS), as the high-risk population qualifying for the screening often have increased likelihood for comorbidities due to their smoking history. Methods: The Early Detection of Cancer of the Lung Scotland (ECLS) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01925625) study showcases a targeted approach to NLCS by implementing the blood-based biomarker EarlyCDT-Lung test. Firstly, this paper explored the ECLS dataset for comorbidities present within the screening population at baseline A chi-square analysis was then undertaken to investigate the relationship of cohort allocation and incidence of new comorbidities over the five-year follow-up period. Results: High prevalence conditions were cardiovascular (38.5%), neurological/psychiatric (33.9%), gastrointestinal (29.8%), and respiratory (19.2%). While 20.3% of the total patient cohort showed a newly discovered comorbidity, there was no significant variation in new incidences between the intervention and control cohort. Conclusions: When considering these results alongside the all-cause mortality reduction shown in previous analyses, they indicate that this targeted approach to LCS might help improve the benefit-harm ratio through the introduction of biomarkers. Further refining selection criteria for low-dose CT screening might contribute to minimising the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment."

            "abstract": "Background and Objectives: CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have revolutionized the treatment of hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative (HR(+)/HER2(-)) breast cancer. Despite their efficacy, interstitial lung disease (ILD) remains a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect. This study aims to evaluate the incidence and clinical characteristics of ILD associated with CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer patients in Turkey. Materials and Methods: A retrospective multicenter analysis included 464 breast cancer patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors between January 2017 and April 2024. Patients receiving ribociclib or palbociclib were evaluated for the development of ILD. Radiological assessments were performed to confirm ILD and exclude other conditions. Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: ILD was identified in 10 patients (2.1%). The average age of the affected patients was 62.5 \u00b1 9.85 years. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) were the most common radiological patterns. Palbociclib was implicated in six cases, while ribociclib was associated with four cases. Grade 3 pulmonary toxicity was observed in eight patients, and Grade 4 toxicity in two patients. One patient who was on palbociclib died due to ILD. No significant correlation was found between ILD and age, smoking status, lung metastases, or prior thoracic radiotherapy. Conclusions: The incidence of CDK4/6 inhibitor-associated ILD in Turkish breast cancer patients appears higher than previously reported in clinical trials. More robust, long-term studies are necessary to identify potential risk factors and mitigate ILD-related mortality."

This study aimed to investigate the independent and combined effects of MetS and HLF on the risk of 16 site-specific cancers in a large community-based cohort.\nMETHODS: A total of 289,557 participants in the UK Biobank were analyzed. MetS was defined using a combination of metabolic factors, while HLF scores were evaluated based on lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between MetS or HLF and cancer risk, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education level, family history of cancer, and the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.69 years, 11,190 individuals developed cancer. MetS was associated with an increased risk of 9 cancers in men and 7 cancers in women. Compared with participants with unfavorable lifestyles, regardless of metabolic status, HLF was significantly associated with decreased risk of overall cancer (without MetS: HR: 0.812; 95% CI: 0.745-0.886 for intermediate lifestyle and HR: 0.757; 95% CI: 0.669-0.855 for favorable lifestyle; with MetS: HR: 0.702; 95% CI: 0.572-0.862 for favorable lifestyle) and oesophagus, stomach, liver, lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in men and of lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in women. Our analysis demonstrated that the protective association between HLF and reduced cancer risk was confined to subgroups without MetS. Specifically, this association was observed for cancers of the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, colon, rectum, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and lymphoid leukemia in men, and for overall cancer in women(HR: 0.917; 95% CI: 0.862-0.975 for intermediate lifestyle and HR: 0.875; 95% CI: 0.817-0.938 for favorable lifestyle).\nCONCLUSION: MetS elevates risks for multiple cancers, while adopting a healthy lifestyle reduces risks of oesophagus, stomach, and lung, bronchus, trachea cancers in men and lung, bronchus, trachea cancer in women, regardless of metabolic status. However, MetS counteracts lifestyle-mediated protection against specific cancers-including lip, oral cavity, pharynx, colon, rectum, pancreas, kidney, and bladder cancers in men, as well as pancreas and breast cancers in women. These findings underscore the necessity to develop metabolic status-stratified management strategies and implement proactive prevention of MetS."

            "abstract": "Lung cancer mortality rates in the United States have declined steeply in recent decades, largely because of substantial reductions in smoking prevalence, as approximately 85% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to cigarette smoking. In this study, the authors estimate the number of averted lung cancer deaths and corresponding person-years of life gained during 1970-2022 as a measure of progress in cancer prevention through tobacco control. By using the 1970-2022 National Center for Health Statistics mortality data (with national coverage), the authors calculated the expected number of deaths for each year, age, sex, race, and age group based on the expected lung cancer death rate multiplied by the population at risk in that group. The number of averted lung cancer deaths were calculated by subtracting the observed number of deaths from the expected number in each group. Person-years of life gained were estimated as a measure of avoided premature mortality based on the average additional years a person would have lived if they had not died from lung cancer. The authors estimated that 3,856,240 lung cancer deaths (2,246,610 in men, 1,609,630 in women) were averted, and 76,275,550 person-years of life (40,277,690 in men, 35,997,860 in women) were gained during 1970-2022, with an average of 19.8 person-years of life gained (17.9 in men, 22.4 in women) per averted death. The number of averted lung cancer deaths accounted for 51.4% of the estimated declines in overall cancer deaths and was substantially greater in men (60.1%) than in women (42.7%). By race, this proportion was 53.6% in the White population (62.8% in men, 44.6% in women) and 40.0% in the Black population (44.4% in men, 34.7% in women). The substantial estimated numbers of averted lung cancer deaths and person-years of life gained highlight the remarkable effect of progress against smoking on reducing premature mortality from lung cancer."

Data collection included demographic variables and assessments using the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF), Herth Hope Index (HHI), and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Latent profile analysis was employed to classify FCR levels and identify influencing factors.\nRESULTS: Three distinct FCR profiles emerged: \"low FCR\" (27.6%), \"moderate FCR\" (66.2%), and \"high FCR\" (6.2%). Independent risk factors for moderate FCR included individuals aged 36-60 years (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b1.871, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.208-2.899) and a household income below 5000 yuan (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b1.86, 95% CI 1.059-3.267). Protective factors for moderate FCR included lower levels of education (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.505, 95% CI 0.283-0.902), religious beliefs (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.355, 95% CI 0.152-0.833), and smoking (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.461, 95% CI 0.284-0.747). High FCR was strongly associated with being 36-60 years old, lower HHI scores (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b11.055, 95% CI 4.441-27.522), and poor social support (OR\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b3.392, 95% CI 1.385-8.308).\nCONCLUSIONS: FCR among patients with early-stage NSCLC can be categorized into distinct profiles, with specific demographic and psychosocial factors influencing severity. Tailored nursing interventions addressing varying FCR levels are critical to improving patient care and psychological well-being."

This study enrolled SCLC patients with insensitivity to initial chemotherapy and analyzed their clinicopathological characteristics. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors that influence chemosensitivity. The study evaluated 142 cases to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics of SCLC populations with insensitivity to initial chemotherapy. Between the chemotherapy-insensitive group (n\u2005=\u200532) and the chemotherapy-sensitive group (n\u2005=\u2005110), no significant differences were observed in sex, age, smoking status, tumor size, lymph-node metastasis, vascular invasion, carcinomatous lymphangitis, mediastinal invasion, superior vena cava syndrome, tumor stage, brain metastases, pleural metastasis, lung metastasis, adrenal metastasis, or the immunohistochemical markers cytokeratin, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, thyroid transcription factor-1, and Ki-67 (all P\u2005>\u2005.05).

Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that bone metastasis (P\u2005=\u2005.008) was an independent high-risk factor for insensitivity to initial first-line chemotherapy. Bone metastasis is an independent high-risk factor for insensitivity to initial chemotherapy in SCLC.

The target of this study was to investigate the most common malignancies and to identify factors that increase the cancer risk in systemic sclerosis patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-centre retrospective study, we screened 252 patients attending our outpatient clinic between January 2005 and December 2021.\nRESULTS: A total of 252 systemic sclerosis patients were included in the study. Data for the patients were obtained by evaluating their medical records retrospectively. A total of 252 patients with systemic sclerosis were analysed. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with malignancies. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy among patients. Malignancies were not correlated with sex, follow-up period, type of systemic sclerosis, organ involvement, smoking history, serological tests, comorbidities, dose and duration of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but advanced age at systemic sclerosis diagnosis increased the risk of malignancy (p\u2009=\u20090.017) in systemic sclerosis patients.\nCONCLUSION: In the current study, advanced age at systemic sclerosis diagnosis was determined to be an extra risk factor for the initiation of cancer in systemic sclerosis patients. Particularly in this patient group, additional screenings might be helpful for early diagnosis. Treatments such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil can be used without additional cancer risk."

Data on the population's smoking habits was retrieved from surveys and from taxation on the sale of cigarettes. The occurrence of larynx cancer was compared to smoking habits, sex and age. The time trends were compared between larynx and lung cancer.\nRESULTS: Over the years, Swedish men and women have had different smoking habits, especially older persons during the 1970s. In 1963, the prevalence of current smokers in women 50-69 years was 11%, while it was 46% in men. Around 2020, less than 10% of men and women in all age groups were current smokers. However, men had higher incidence rates of larynx cancer than women, even when their smoking habits were similar. For example, men and women 60-64 years of age in 2017-2021 had similar smoking habits during their life but the relative risk of larynx cancer in men compared to women was 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-4.8). However, pipe smoking was much more common in men.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that other causes than cigarette smoking have an impact on the occurrence of larynx cancer in Sweden. Pipe smoking and occupational exposure to carcinogenic materials such as asbestos may be underlying causes of the difference in cancer risk between Swedish men and women."

This modification is installed by a methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3)-METTL14 complex and is eliminated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5). Aberrant m6A modification is associated with the development and progression of cancer. Cigarette smoking is a major lifestyle habit and risk factor for lung cancer. This study aimed to clarify the effects of cigarette smoking on the expression of m6A modification-regulating enzymes and the significance of m6A modification in the biological responses to cigarette smoking. Treatment of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) significantly decreased METTL3 and METTL14 protein levels in human lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells. The induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a typical ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), was attenuated by the knockdown (KD) of METTL3 or ALKBH5, whereas it was enhanced by the KD of FTO. As the underlying mechanisms, significantly decreased expression of AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) by the KD of METTL3 or ALKBH5, and significantly decreased expression of AHR repressor (AHRR) by the KD of FTO were demonstrated. Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements assay revealed that the KD of METTL3 or ALKBH5 resulted in the compaction of the chromatin structure of ARNT promoter, suggesting that METTL3 and ALKBH5 promote the transcription of ARNT through the rearrangement of chromatin structure. Collectively, we found that CSE treatment decreased METTL3 and METTL14 protein levels, and m6A modification have impact on the induction of CYP1A1 by modulating ARNT and AHRR expression."

We compared these with a subcohort (n\u00a0=\u00a02031) drawn from the full cohort. Work histories were linked to a previously developed industry-specific benzene job-exposure matrix (JEM). Cox regression for case-cohort analyses was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CRC, adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, red/processed meat intake, and physical activity.\nRESULTS: Risks of CRC increased with increasing benzene exposure. For all CRC, the HRs (95% CI) for the most exposed [quartile 4] vs. the unexposed were 1.32 (0.96 to 1.81, [0.177-0.879\u00a0ppm-years]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.085) for cumulative, 1.52 (1.11 to 2.07, [17-34 years]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.032) for duration, and 1.56 (1.15 to 2.12, [0.015-0.046\u00a0ppm]; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.005) for average intensity of benzene exposure.

Sensitivity analyses showed consistent associations.\nCONCLUSION: This study found positive exposure-response associations between low-level benzene exposure and CRC risk in offshore petroleum workers. These findings add to emerging evidence that benzene can be associated with solid tumours including lung and bladder, which potentially has important occupational and public health implications."

We thus hypothesize that only maternal half-siblings share the childhood environment to the same extent than full siblings.\nMETHODS: We used Swedish nation-wide data on family structures and cancers up to year 2021 to determined LC risk (standardized incidence ratio, SIR with 95% confidence intervals) in maternal and paternal half-siblings and in full siblings.\nRESULTS: Familial risk for LC in maternal half-siblings was 2.21 (1.76-2.77) which was not different from that of full siblings 2.23 (2.22-2.44). For paternal half-siblings the risk was 1.56 (1.21-2.01). For adenocarcinoma the risks were for full siblings 2.36 (2.23-2.51), for maternal half-siblings 2.55 (1.93-3.35) and for paternal half-siblings 1.33 (0.94-1.87).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results showed that familial risk for LC was equal in full siblings and in maternal half-siblings; the risks for paternal half-siblings were lower and for adenocarcinoma significantly lower than those for full siblings. The results suggest that smoking is a major contributor to familial risk of LC in this setting. Smoking starts at an early age and anti-smoking campaigns should target childhood environment for prevention of smoking initiation."

            "title": "Sex-specific radiation-associated lung cancer mortality risks as impacted by smoking among US radiologic technologists.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors estimated greater risks of radiation-associated lung cancer among females than males, with direct implications for occupational radiation safety policy. To evaluate replicability of these findings in radiation workers, we assessed sex-specific radiation-associated risks of lung cancer mortality in a large cohort of U.S. radiologic technologists.\nMETHODS: Using data from four questionnaires (1983-2013), we reconstructed lifetime smoking history for 83,715 female and 26,650 male technologists. We estimated individual lung occupational radiation doses using badge dose and questionnaire data. We used Poisson regression to investigate joint radiation-smoking effects on sex-averaged and sex-specific lung cancer mortality risk.\nRESULTS: For 1243 female and 607 male technologists who died from lung cancer, median cumulative lung dose was 16.2mGy (non-cases: 7.7mGy) and 24.5mGy (non-cases: 10.1mGy), respectively. Excess risk of lung cancer increased with increasing radiation dose. However, smoking modified this effect: the radiation effect at 100mGy increased until 16 cigarettes/day, after which it declined. Excess relative risk (ERR) per 100mGy was greater among males (never smoking additive ERR\u2009=\u20091.98; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.34, 6.25) than females (never smoking additive ERR\u2009=\u20090.40; 95%CI=-0.02, 1.21); sex-differences persisted up to \u223c40 cigarettes/day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated radiation-associated risks of lung cancer mortality were stronger in males than females, in contrast to the Life Span Study. However, both studies found radiation-associated risks were highest in workers with light-to-moderate smoking intensity. Altogether, these findings reinforce the importance of rigorous radiation protection measures for all radiation workers, regardless of sex, alongside interventions to support smoking cessation."

            "title": "Summary of best evidence for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after surgery for patients undergoing gastric cancer operations.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications in gastric cancer surgery significantly impact patient recovery and prognosis. These complications, including infections, can increase hospital stays and costs, and even lead to death. Numerous risk factors are involved, such as age, smoking history, and lung function. Although preventive measures exist, a unified and effective strategy is lacking. Therefore, researching and implementing effective prevention measures is crucial for improving patients' postoperative quality of life and survival rates.\nAIM: To collate and summarize the best available evidence for the prevention of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery, thereby providing a reference for the clinical development of relevant intervention strategies.\nMETHODS: A literature search was conducted in databases including BMJ Best Practice, UpToDate, JBI, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, the Ontario Nurses Registration Network, the U.S. National Clinical Practice Guidelines, and MedLine, for documents related to the prevention of pulmonary complications in gastric cancer surgery patients. The search period extended from the inception of these databases to July 25, 2024. The quality of the literature was evaluated according to the standards of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Evidence-Based Health Care Center, and evidence was extracted from the included documents.\nRESULTS: A total of 27 documents were ultimately included. The extracted content encompassed three areas: preoperative assessment, risk prevention and intervention measures, totaling 31 best evidences across five categories. The findings of our study underscore the significance of comprehensive preoperative assessments, such as the ARISCAT index for pulmonary risk evaluation, and stress the importance of preoperative interventions like inspiratory muscle training, smoking cessation, and oral care in mitigating postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following gastric cancer surgery. We also advocate for the adoption of protective lung ventilation strategies during surgery and continuous pulse oximetry monitoring postoperatively, along with targeted treatments for specific complications.\nCONCLUSION: The best evidence extracted for the prevention of complications in gastric cancer surgery patients serves as a basis for evidence-based practice for the prevention of pulmonary complications in this patient group. Further research topics on pulmonary complications of gastric cancer, we recommend further optimization of preoperative assessment tools, investigation into the efficacy of smoking cessation programs, comparative studies on intraoperative ventilation strategies, development of postoperative rehabilitation programs, and research into culturally and resource-sensitive interventions to broaden the global applicability of these practices."

Among them, 1,168 had positive CT reports for pulmonary nodules, while 3,693 had negative findings. We developed a machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm and employed an improved sooty tern optimization algorithm (ISTOA) for feature selection. The significance of the selected features was evaluated through univariate analysis and multivariable logistic stepwise regression analysis. A visualization system was created to estimate the risk of developing pulmonary nodules.\nRESULTS: Multivariable analysis identified older age, smoking or passive smoking, high psychological stress within the past year, occupational exposure (e.g., air pollution at the workplace), presence of chronic lung diseases, and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels as significant risk factors for pulmonary nodules. The feature self-recognition machine learning model further highlighted age, smoking or passive smoking, high psychological stress, occupational exposure, chronic lung diseases, family history of lung cancer, decreased albumin levels, and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen as key predictors for early pulmonary nodule risk, demonstrating superior performance.\nCONCLUSION: The feature self-recognition machine learning model effectively aids in the early prediction and clinical identification of pulmonary nodule risk, facilitating timely intervention and improving patient prognosis."

This retrospective study analyzed data from 4171 NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations treated at Shanghai Chest Hospital from August 2019 to September 2023. Among them, 182 patients receiving third-generation EGFR-TKIs monotherapy as a first-line treatment were enrolled. Patients were categorized by biopsy sites into primary lung lesions (n\u2009=\u2009112) and metastatic lymph nodes (n\u2009=\u200970). PD-L1 expression was stratified based on tumor cell proportion score (TPS): <\u20091%, 1%-49%, and \u2265\u200950%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 18.33\u2009months. In the PD-L1 TPS group, PFS was 18.87\u2009months for TPS <\u20091%, 17.6\u2009months for TPS 1%-49%, and 13.6\u2009months for TPS \u2265\u200950%, with significant differences across groups (p\u2009=\u20090.026). Moreover, multivariate analysis identified smoking history [HR\u2009=\u20091.653, 95% CI (1.132-2.414), p\u2009=\u20090.009] and TPS \u2265\u200950% [HR\u2009=\u20092.069, 95% CI (1.183-3.618), p\u2009=\u20090.011] as independent risk factors. In primary lesions, the median PFS was 21.93\u2009months for TPS <\u20091%, 18.57\u2009months for TPS 1%-49%, and 10.17\u2009months for TPS \u2265\u200950%, with significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, PD-L1 expression in metastatic lymph nodes was not associated with PFS (p\u2009=\u20090.973). In advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, high PD-L1 expression may suggest reduced efficacy of third-generation EGFR-TKIs. The spatial heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression could influence its predictive accuracy for third-generation EGFR-TKI efficacy."

This study aims to determine the most appropriate approach for nodules detected by computed tomography. A total of 526 patients, who underwent surgery for pulmonary nodules or masses and had pathological diagnoses, were included in the study. Demographic features, clinical history, and surgery-related data of the patients were assessed by a thoracic surgeon, whereas radiological features were evaluated by a radiologist. Of the patients, 147 were female and 379 were male. The mean age was 63 years (min 15, max 89), and the average lesion size was 22\u2009mm (min 4, max 116). Postoperative analysis revealed 132 benign lesions (25.1%), 380 malignant (72.2%), and 14 metastases (2.7%). Among 347 patients, the nodule size was below 30\u2009mm. Malignant nodules showed a higher median age and larger lesion size (P\u2005<\u2005.05 for both). Lesion contour, calcification, pleural tail, changes in lesion during follow-up, presence of emphysema, enlarged lymph nodes, history of malignancy, and smoking were statistically significant in determining the nature of the detected lesion. The clinical and radiological characteristics of patients can be utilized to determine the risk of malignancy in detected nodules. Even if the nodule size is small, histopathological diagnosis may be a more suitable option for high-risk patients instead of radiological follow-up."

Participants with missing Lung Computed Tomography Screening Reporting & Data System scores or a lung cancer diagnosis prior to LCS initiation were excluded. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to October 2024.\nEXPOSURES: For negative baseline screening results, T1 and T2 screening adherence was defined as chest computed tomography (CT) between 10 and 18 months and 22 and 30 months after baseline, respectively. For positive baseline screening results, T1 and T2 adherence was defined as chest CT between 11 and 21 months and 28 and 36 months after baseline, respectively.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were annual T1 and T2 LCS adherence rates and associations between T1 and T2 screening adherence; annual incident lung cancer diagnoses in rounds T0 (0-12 months after baseline), T1 (>12 to 24 months after baseline), and T2 (>24 to 36 months after baseline); and cancer stage distribution.\nRESULTS: A total of 10\u202f170 individuals received baseline LCS (median age, 65 years [IQR, 60-69 years]; 5415 [53.2%] male). During round T1, 6141 of 10\u202f033 eligible patients (61.2% [95% CI, 60.2%-62.2%]) were adherent, and during round T2, 5028 of 9966 eligible patients (50.5% [95% CI, 49.5%-51.4%]) were adherent. T1 adherence was significantly associated with T2 adherence (adjusted relative risk, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.06-2.79). Across 36 months of follow-up, 279 patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 2.4%-3.1%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Incident lung cancer diagnosis rates were 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.6%), 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.8%), and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.9%) during rounds T0, T1, and T2, respectively. Lung cancer diagnosis rates were higher among individuals who were LCS adherent vs nonadherent during both rounds T1 (59 of 6141 [1.0%; 95% CI, 0.7%-1.2%] vs 8 of 3892 [0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and T2 (63 of 5028 [1.3%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%] vs 12 of 4938 [0.2%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

            "abstract": "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are associated with many adverse health effects in humans, including cancers, immune, reproductive, neurological disorders and metabolic diseases. These chemicals are known to accumulate in fatty tissues, from which they can be released in other tissue compartments of living organisms, in particular, upon weight loss. This dynamic distribution of POPs remains, however poorly investigated. In this study, a xenografted POP-contaminated adipose tissue (AT) model was used to assess 1) their concentrations in the ATs, the liver and the brain and 2) their associated effects by transcriptomics, metabolomics and lipidomics approaches. In the ATs, the liver and the brain of mice grafted with POP-contaminated fat pad, most of POPs were detected 3 days and 21 days after the graft with the highest concentrations in the ATs and the lowest concentrations in the brain. Conversely, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances presented a distinct profile as they persist in the liver but not in the ATs or in the brain. In the AT of POP-exposed mice, the most dysregulated pathways were related to mitochondrial functions, endobiotic (carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid) and xenobiotic metabolism and inflammatory response. In the liver of grafted mice, many pathways related to mitochondrial functions and metabolism were dysregulated. These results support that realistic mixture of POPs that accumulate in AT and liver induces a systemic metabolic dysfunction which may represent the mechanisms by which the POPs can promote metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases."

The increasing prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic predisposition has blurred the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, leading to diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Double diabetes presents with overlapping symptoms from both diabetes types, making accurate diagnosis crucial. Biomarkers, such as C-peptide levels, autoantibody testing, and insulin resistance markers, help differentiate double diabetes from classic diabetes subtypes. Early intervention is necessary because of the condition's elevated risk of microvascular and macrovascular consequences, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease. Effective management integrates pharmacological and lifestyle approaches. Metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and insulin therapy adjustments all boost glycemic control and metabolic results. Additionally, structured exercise, dietary modifications, and weight management are essential for reducing insulin resistance and preserving beta-cell activity. The potential of precision medicine, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven healthcare, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers promising advancements for personalized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on targeted immunotherapies, genetic profiling, and refined clinical guidelines to improve early detection and individualized treatment, with long-term outcomes. The review emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach in managing double diabetes, ensuring early diagnosis, optimized treatment, and improved metabolic health to mitigate long-term complications."

We report a 64-year-old male with diabetes and chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin who developed pulmonary hemorrhage, acute kidney injury (AKI), and markedly elevated cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) levels shortly after increasing his tirzepatide dose. His international normalized ratio (INR) was supratherapeutic at 8.7, prompting warfarin discontinuation. Despite INR normalization, he developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) and worsening renal function. Workup revealed ANCA-associated vasculitis, though confirmation by renal biopsy was pending at the time of the patient's expiration. He required corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, rituximab, and hemodialysis. This case highlights potential pharmacokinetic interactions between tirzepatide and warfarin, as well as a possible role for tirzepatide in triggering autoimmunity. While definitive causality remains unclear, clinicians should closely monitor INR levels in patients on GLP-1RAs and warfarin and be vigilant for autoimmune complications in those presenting with pulmonary-renal syndromes.

The present cohort study aims to explore the relationship between ABSI and all-cause mortality in US adults with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).\nMETHODS: For this cohort study, we extracted information on 5,461 US adults with T2D from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the NHANES Linked Mortality File. Trends in ABSI from 1999 to 2018 were calculated and analyzed using partial Mann-Kendall tests. To assess the relationship between ABSI and all-cause mortality, as well as the robustness of the association results, we employed weighted restricted cubic splines (RCS), weighted Cox proportional hazards models, sensitivity analyses, and stratified analyses. Additionally, we conducted time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate ABSI's predictive capability for all-cause mortality over 3, 5, and 10\u00a0years.\nRESULTS: Among US adults with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), the mean ABSI gradually increased from 0.08333 to 0.08444 between 1999 and 2018. Following a median follow-up period of 90\u00a0months, 1,355 deaths (24.8% of the participants) occurred due to all causes. A left J-shaped association was observed between ABSI and all-cause mortality, with a 39% increased risk among US adults with T2D who had an ABSI below 0.08105 after full adjustment.\nCONCLUSION: Our research has demonstrated a significant association between an elevated ABSI and the risk of all-cause mortality among US adults with T2D.

Data were analysed through inductive thematic analysis by two independent coders.\nRESULTS: The findings are structured around two main categories: the current role of lifestyle in consultations and nurses' perspectives on the future of lifestyle counselling. Diabetes nurses consider lifestyle an essential component of care but face numerous barriers to discussing it effectively. Key challenges include limited expertise, a lack of practical guidelines, time constraints, patient motivation, and the patient-provider relationship. Nurses prioritise raising awareness, educating, and providing brief personalised advice, while comprehensive lifestyle coaching is beyond their scope. They emphasise the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration to ensure a holistic approach that incorporates multiple lifestyle factors and individual circumstances. Nurses also recognise the potential of eHealth, anti-obesity medication, and novel insulin pumps to support lifestyle changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle counselling is complex and influenced by various factors.

We aim to review the available evidence on the metabolic effects of tirzepatide, focusing on weight loss and maintenance of lost weight, body composition alterations, appetite regulation, glycemic control, and lipid profile modulation. Tirzepatide administration for 72 weeks elicited significant weight reduction ranging from 5\u202f% to 20.9\u202f% across different trials in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, limited evidence showed that lost body weight may be primarily due to fat mass reduction. Tirzepatide also significantly decreased food intake, reduced overall appetite scores and increased fasting visual analog scale scores for satiety and fullness across different clinical trials. Moreover, tirzepatide exhibited favorable effects on glycemic control, with notable reductions in HbA1c levels ranging from 20.4\u202fmmol/mol with the 5\u202fmg dose to 28.2\u202fmmol/mol with the 15\u202fmg dose, following treatment durations lasting 40-52 weeks. Additionally, tirzepatide exerts a beneficial impact on lipid profile parameters, including reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Despite its efficacy, tirzepatide is associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects, which requires dose escalation strategies to enhance tolerability. Mild to moderate adverse events are commonly reported at higher doses, with discontinuation rates ranging from 4\u202f% to 10\u202f% across different dosages. In conclusion, tirzepatide has shown multifaceted metabolic effects, along with manageable adverse profiles, which makes it a promising therapeutic agent for addressing both obesity and T2DM. However, further long-term randomized controlled trials are warranted to reveal long-term efficacy and safety outcomes, particularly in diverse patient populations."

Lignans, a class of plant natural compounds found in commonly consumed foods, are well-tolerated by humans and have demonstrated promising potential in the management of DM. Consumption of lignan-rich foods has been associated with improved overall health and quality of life.\nPURPOSE: The clinical and preclinical evidence on the role of lignans in managing DM are critically examined.\nMETHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted across major scientific databases, focusing on studies that reported the effects of individual lignans on key diabetes indicators, such as glucose utilisation and insulin sensitivity, in both human and animal models, as well as in cell-based studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 lignans were included in the review. Out of these, only three were investigated in randomised clinical trials in humans and 31 in animal models. The reviewed evidence suggests some beneficial effects of lignans in preventing the development of obesity-related diabetes. Their therapeutic benefits in preventing diabetes-related complications, particularly diabetic nephropathy, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, are also supported. Metabolites of various lignans, produced by microbial metabolism in the gut and serum enzymes, appear to be key bioactive forms, highlighting the need for detailed pharmacodynamic studies, optimised dosage designs, and the use of the appropriate lignan molecules for cell-based screening.\nCONCLUSION: Lignans and their microbial metabolites show promise in preventing obesity-related diabetes and mitigating diabetes-related complications such as diabetic nephropathy, though further clinical studies are needed to optimize their therapeutic potential."

            "title": "Abilities of Rare Sugar Members to Release Glucagon-like Peptide-1 and Suppress Food Intake in Mice.",
            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Rare sugars, which naturally exist in small quantities, have gained attention as next-generation functional sugars due to their sweetness and low calorie content. Some of them have already been commercialized. Rare sugar-containing syrups, produced through alkaline isomerization of high-fructose corn syrup, are effective in preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain incompletely understood. Recently, D-allulose has been found to improve hyperphagic obesity by stimulating the secretion of the intestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The present study aimed to determine the comparative effects of aldohexoses (D-glucose, D-allose) and ketohexoses (D-fructose, D-allulose, D-tagatose, D-sorbose) on GLP-1 secretion and food intake in male mice. Method and Results: Single peroral administration of four ketohexoses at 1 and 3 g/kg, but not aldohexoses at 1 and 3 g/kg, significantly increased plasma GLP-1 concentrations with comparable efficacy. Moreover, these ketohexoses at 1 g/kg suppressed food intake in the short term, an effect blunted by GLP-1 receptor antagonism. In contrast, zero-calorie D-allose at 3 g/kg suppressed feeding without raising plasma GLP-1 levels. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that D-allulose, D-tagatose, and D-sorbose, which are low-calorie rare sugars classified as ketohexoses, suppress food intake through promoting GLP-1 secretion, showing their potential to prevent and/or ameliorate type 2 diabetes, obesity and related diseases."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by disturbances\u2002in glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism, including dyslipidemia and dysregulation of metabolic peptides like spexin; however, the effects of combined interventions, such as aerobic training and nutritional intervention, on these parameters are not fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to investigate the influences of aerobic training (AT) and vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation on the lipid profile and spexin levels in a model of rats with type 2 diabetes\u2002(T2D).\nMETHODS: A total of 56 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: SHAM (non-diabetic control; n\u2009=\u20098) and diabetic (n\u2009=\u200948). The diabetic rats were further divided into six groups: AT with high doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), AT with moderate doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), high doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009HD; 10,000 IU/kg/week), moderate doses of vitamin D (D\u2009+\u2009MD; 5,000 IU/kg/week), AT receiving vehicle (sesame oil; D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009oil), and control (oil-receiving; D\u2009+\u2009C). To induce type 2 diabetes, rats were first fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks to induce obesity, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 110\u00a0mg/kg nicotinamide and 55\u00a0mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in 0.1\u00a0M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Blood samples were collected 48\u00a0h after the last training session under anesthesia for measuring spexin levels, and lipid profile parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Tukey post hoc test.\nRESULTS: Compared to the SHAM rats, there were significant increases in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC in the diabetic rats (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Also, there was a significant decrease in body weight, BMI, FI, and WC of the\u2002diabetic groups who received interventions, especially in D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD (body weight: -11.07%, BMI: -10.25%, FI: -19.16%, WC: -16.54%). The lipid profiles were significantly improved, with the lowest total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and the highest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels being found in the D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD\u2002group compared with the D\u2009+\u2009C group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the D\u2009+\u2009AT\u2009+\u2009HD group had elevated spexin levels compared with the other diabetic groups, which may play a metabolic\u2002role.\nCONCLUSION: AT and Vit D supplementation effectively normalized serum lipids and increased spexin levels in T2D rats. These findings suggest that AT and Vit D supplementation may serve as potential therapeutic strategies for managing T2D and its associated complications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the long-term effects of these interventions in humans."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study systematically explores the overall impact and interactions of body composition and nutritional inflammatory indices on early-onset mild cognitive impairment (EOMCI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study included 816 T2DM patients. Body composition indices included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), visceral fat area (VFA), body fat percentage (BF%), and skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI). Nutritional inflammatory indices included the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index (CALLY), and fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR). K-means clustering and quantile g-computation (QGC) assessed the combined impact, with interactions evaluated by simple slope analysis.\nRESULTS: K-means clustering revealed two distinct patterns: Low-pattern and High-pattern. The Low-pattern group exhibited significantly lower body composition indices (BMI 24.6 vs. 27.7 kg/m2; WC 88 vs. 99 cm; ABSI 0.081 vs. 0.084; BRI 3.89 vs. 5.02; VFA 91 vs. 112; BF% 29% vs. 31%; SMMI 9.38 vs. 10.48 kg/m2; all P &lt; 0.001) and poorer nutritional status with higher inflammation (GNRI 97.9 vs. 104.6; PNI 47.9 vs. 53.1; CALLY index 4 vs. 5; FAR 0.082 vs. 0.072; all P &lt; 0.05). This group had a higher prevalence of EOMCI (32% vs. 23%, P = 0.006). After adjusting for confounders, the Low-pattern group had a 1.45-fold increased risk of EOMCI (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01-2.08). QGC analysis demonstrated that the combined overall effect of body composition and nutritional inflammatory indices was negatively associated with EOMCI risk. A one-quintile increase in all indices was linked to a significant 31.3% reduction in EOMCI risk (95% CI -44.4%, -15.0%). Interaction analysis revealed that abdominal obesity (ABSI &gt; 0.08), combined with malnutrition (low GNRI), significantly increased EOMCI risk (P <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.018). Similarly, low muscle mass (SMMI &lt; 11.33 kg/m2), when combined with malnutrition and high inflammation (low CALLY index), further exacerbated EOMCI risk (P <sub>interaction</sub>  = 0.028).\nDISCUSSION: The findings suggest that in T2DM patients, the interactions and overall effects of underweight, reduced muscle mass, abdominal obesity, malnutrition, and elevated inflammation are significantly associated with an increased risk of EOMCI. Integrated management of these factors is essential to mitigate EOMCI risk."

            "abstract": "Patients with diabetes had significant vascular resistance, which was explained by vascular remodeling and an increase in fluid volume as a result of hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes impairs lipid catabolism, and obesity raises the risk of isolated systolic hypertension. However, in Ethiopia minimal study has been conducted to address the specific relationship between isolated systolic hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to determine the magnitude and determinants of isolated systolic hypertension among type 2 diabetes patients in selected referral hospitals of Amhara region, Ethiopia. A multicenter institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 and December 30, 2023. Referral hospitals were chosen using simple random sampling. Additionally, participants in the study were chosen from the designated referral hospitals using systematic sampling approaches. To collect clinical and sociodemographic data, an interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized. Epi-data version-4.6 and Stata-14 were used for data entry and statistical analysis, respectively. The descriptive statistics were presented with tables and graphs. A binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify associated factors of isolated systolic hypertension. In the final model, statistical significance was decided at p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05, and the strength of association was indicated using an adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI. The analysis included 258 participants, and the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension was found to be 21.3% (95% CI 18-27.1%). Older age (AOR\u2009=\u20094.64, 95%CI 1.31,16.36), fasting blood sugar of \u2265\u2009130\u00a0mg/dl (AOR\u2009=\u20092.32, 95% CI; 1.04, 5.19), and BMI\u2009&gt;\u200925 Kg/m2 (AOR\u2009=\u20092.75, 95% CI (1.33, 5.68)) were statistically significant factors of isolated systolic hypertension. The prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in this study was high, affecting large population of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Older age, high body mass index (BMI), and elevated fasting blood sugar levels were identified as key determinants of ISH. The study emphasizes the need for regular monitoring and management of blood pressure in T2DM patients, particularly those who are older, and have higher BMI."

            "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight infants are at increased risk not only of mortality, but also of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD in later life. At the opposite end of the spectrum, high birthweight infants have increased risk of birth complications, such as shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia and obesity, and similarly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of birthweight in the UK Biobank have primarily focused on individuals within the 'normal' range and have excluded individuals with high and low birthweight (<2.5 kg or >4.5 kg). The aim of this study was to investigate genetic variation associated within the tail ends of the birthweight distribution, to: (1) see whether the genetic factors operating in these regions were different from those that explained variation in birthweight within the normal range; (2) explore the genetic correlation between extremes of birthweight and cardiometabolic disease; and (3) investigate whether analysing the full distribution of birthweight values, including the extremes, improved the ability to detect genuine loci in GWAS.\nMETHODS: We performed case-control GWAS analysis of low (&lt;2.5 kg) and high (&gt;4.5 kg) birthweight in the UK Biobank using REGENIE software (N<sub>low</sub>=20,947; N<sub>high</sub>=12,715; N<sub>controls</sub>=207,506) and conducted three continuous GWAS of birthweight, one including the full range of birthweights, one involving a truncated GWAS including only individuals with birthweights between 2.5 and 4.5 kg and a third GWAS that winsorised birthweight values &lt;2.5 kg and &gt;4.5 kg. Additionally, we performed bivariate linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between low/normal/high birthweight and cardiometabolic traits.\nRESULTS: Bivariate LD score regression analyses suggested that high birthweight had a mostly similar genetic aetiology to birthweight within the normal range (genetic correlation coefficient [r<sub>G</sub>]=0.91, 95% CI 0.83, 0.99), whereas there was more evidence for a separate set of genes underlying low birthweight (r<sub>G</sub>=-0.74, 95% CI 0.66, 0.82). Low birthweight was also significantly positively genetically correlated with most cardiometabolic traits and diseases we examined, whereas high birthweight was mostly positively genetically correlated with adiposity and anthropometric-related traits. The winsorisation strategy performed best in terms of locus detection, with the number of independent genome-wide significant associations (p&lt;5\u00d710-8) increasing from 120 genetic variants at 94 loci in the truncated GWAS to 270 genetic variants at 178 loci, including 27 variants at 25 loci that had not been identified in previous birthweight GWAS. This included a novel low-frequency missense variant in the ABCC8 gene, a gene known to be involved in congenital hyperinsulinism, neonatal diabetes mellitus and MODY, that was estimated to be responsible for a 170 g increase in birthweight amongst carriers.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results underscore the importance of genetic factors in the genesis of the phenotypic correlation between birthweight and cardiometabolic traits and diseases."

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have become integral to T2DM management due to their clinical benefits of glucose regulation and weight loss. However, their subcutaneous administration presents challenges to patient adherence, limiting their widespread use. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus\u00ae), the first oral GLP-1 RA approved for T2DM, addresses these challenges through an innovative co-formulation with sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl] amino) caprylate, which enhances gastric absorption and stability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical development of oral semaglutide, with a focus on early-phase trials. Phase 1 studies investigated pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and dose-response relationships, demonstrating a dose-dependent reduction in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and body weight with an acceptable safety profile. Additionally, pharmacological evaluations of interactions with food, dosing condition, disease states, and concomitant medications supported the determination of an optimal dosing regimen for further clinical studies. Phase 2 dose-finding trials confirmed significant HbA<sub>1c</sub> and weight reductions comparable to subcutaneous semaglutide, which guided dose selection for phase 3 trials. Phase 3 trials, including the Peptide InnOvatioN for Early diabEtes tReatment program, demonstrated significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, weight loss, and cardiovascular safety, positioning oral semaglutide as a transformative option in diabetes care.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in screening diabetes and/or prediabetes compared to the 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG)-level in SSA.\nMETHODS: Data from a population-based, cross-sectional diabetes screening survey involving 1550 individuals in Butajira, Ethiopia, and Enugu state, Nigeria were analyzed. Fasting plasma glucose and a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were utilized for diabetes screening. In addition, we determined and plotted the receiver operating characteristic curve for FPG against the reference standard 2-h PG to evaluate the screening tool's sensitivity and specificity.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the study participants was 44.5 (\u00b1\u200916.43) years, with men comprising 50.4% of the cohort. Among 1550 individuals analyzed, 4.6% and 16.8% demonstrated diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, as identified by either FPG or 2-h PG. The agreement between FPG and 2-h PG in identifying diabetes and prediabetes was moderate, with kappa statistic of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.51 - 0.61; p<0.0001) for diabetes and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.40 - 0.50; p<0.0001) for prediabetes. FPG failed to detect 34.1% of all prediabetes and 44.4% of all diabetes cases. The sensitivity of FPG in identifying diabetes cases was 44.3% at a cut-off 126\u2009mg/dL with a specificity of 99.3%. We identified the optimal FPG cut-off for detecting newly identified diabetes cases using 2-h PG to be 105 mg/dL associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 67.2% and 94.0%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: FPG was able to correctly identify 99.3% of individuals with no diabetes but a significant percentage of diabetes cases would have remained undiagnosed if only FPG had been utilized instead of the 2-h PG. The use of 2-h PG test is recommended to diagnose diabetes in older individuals, females and non-obese persons who would be missed if tested by only FPG. Lowering the cut-off value for FPG to 105 mg/dL substantially increases the identification of individuals with diabetes, thus improving the effectiveness of FPG as a screening test for type 2 diabetes."

Multiple linear regression models assessed sexual dimorphism in BMD, adjusting for age and exploring effect modification by group and sex.\nRESULTS: A total of 325 participants were included (T1D [N=123, mean age 22.4 years, 50\u202f% male], T2D [N=72, mean age 16.2 years, 33\u202f% male], HWC [N=79, mean age 16.6 years, 41\u202f% male], and OC [N=51, mean age 13.8 years, 53\u202f% male]). Sexual dimorphism in BMD was evident only in T1D and HWC, with males having higher BMD than females (p=0.021; p<0.001, respectively). BMI was positively correlated with BMD in all groups (p<0.001 for HWC; p=0.001 for OC; p<0.001 for T1D; p=0.008 for T2D). Body fat percentage was inversely correlated with BMD in HWC and T1D (p<0.001; p=0.011, respectively), but not in OC or T2D. Additionally, lean mass percentage was significantly associated with higher BMD in HWC and OC (p<0.001; p=0.023, respectively), but not in groups with diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study documents sexual dimorphism in BMD in youth, with varied associations between body composition metrics and BMD across groups with diabetes and in controls without diabetes, underscoring the importance of understanding these relationships for optimizing bone health during adolescence."

            "title": "Targeting of AMPK/MTOR signaling in the management of atherosclerosis: Outmost leveraging.",
            "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic vascular disorder that is characterized by the thickening and narrowing of arteries due to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. The traditional risk factors involved in AS are obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. Furthermore, non-traditional risk factors for AS, such as inflammation, sleep disturbances, physical inactivity, air pollution, and alterations of gut microbiota, gained attention in relation to the pathogenesis of AS. Interestingly, the pathogenesis of AS, is complex and related to different abnormalities of cellular and sub-cellular signaling pathways. It has been illustrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathways are involved in AS pathogenesis. Mounting evidence indicated that AMPK plays a critical role in attenuating the development of AS by activating autophagy, which is impaired during atherogenesis. AMPK has a vasculoprotective effect by reducing lipid accumulation, inflammatory cell proliferation, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as decreasing inflammatory cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium. AMPK activation by metformin inhibits the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and AS development. However, the MTOR pathway contributes to AS by inhibiting autophagy, highlighting autophagy as a crucial link between the AMPK and MTOR pathways in AS pathogenesis. The MTOR is a key inducer of endothelial dysfunction and is involved in the development of AS. Therefore, both the AMPK and MTOR pathways play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AS. However, the exact role of AMPK and MTOR pathways in the pathogenesis of AS is not fully clarified. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the potential role of the AMPK/MTOR signaling pathway in AS, and how AMPK activators and MTOR inhibitors influence the development and progression of AS. In conclusion, AMPK activators and MTOR inhibitors have vasculoprotective effects against the development and progression of AS."

            "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been linked to various health benefits, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity effects. Obesity, marked by abnormal fat deposition, increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and type-2 diabetes. Natural anti-adipogenic modulators with insulin sensitivity are one of the approaches to address the issue. In the present study, four distinct CLA-producing probiotic strains (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LUL:01, Latilactobacillus curvatus LGM:16, Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum LRJ1:09, and Enterococcus faecalis LJM:05) were assessed in vitro for their potential anti-adipogenic properties using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Out of four strains, LGM:16 inhibited lipid accumulation (100.27%), reduced intracellular triglyceride content (168.42, 168.16, and 153.66\u00a0mg/dL in a dose-dependent manner), and enhanced insulin sensitivity (32.23%) by increasing glucose uptake. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed the expression genes (PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, and GLUT-4) in LGM:16 strain. Consequently, LGM: 16 was used to develop a non-dairy probiotic formulation incorporating honey and Pleurotus ostreatus mushroom, ensuring a probiotic count above the minimum recommended level of 6 Log10 CFU/mL. Further, response surface methodology optimized probiotic beverage formulation to achieve favorable nutritional, good sensory profile, antioxidant, and anti-obesity activity, making it a promising candidate for health benefits."

Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively analyze the correlation between conventional and unconventional lipid profiles and visceral fat area (VFA) in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Emphasizing the overall relationship between lipid metabolism and visceral fat accumulation.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1288 overweight/obese T2DM patients, with VFA measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis and visceral fat obesity (VFO) was defined as VFA \u2265 100 cm\u00b2. Both conventional lipid profiles include total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and lipoprotein(a), and unconventional lipid profiles include lipid composite index (LCI), platelet/ HDL-c ratio (PHR), remnant cholesterol (RC), TG/HDL-c, Castelli Risk Index I (CRI-I), Castelli Risk Index II (CRI-II), Non-HDL-c, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and atherogenic coefficient (AC) were analyzed. The study population was divided into non-VFO and VFO groups, The relationship between conventional and unconventional lipid profiles and VFO was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Compared to the non-VFO group, the VFO group exhibited significantly higher levels of TG, lipoprotein(a), LCI, RC, TG/HDL-c, CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP, and AC (all P < 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that RC, TG, LCI, TG/HDL-c, CRI-I, CRI-II, AIP, and AC were positively correlated with VFA and VFO, while HDL-c and lipoprotein(a) were negatively correlated (all P < 0.05). Logistic regression identified RC as an independent risk factor for VFO (OR: 1.667, 95% CI: 1.216-2.285, P = 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Among lipid profiles, RC is independently and significantly associated with VFO, underscoring its role in lipid metabolism and abdominal obesity management, especially in overweight/obese T2DM patients."

            "abstract": "The concurrent presence of complex metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes within an individual is known as diabesity. Various organs are involved in metabolic chronic diseases like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. In the last few years, the rise in diabetes cases has coincided with the rapid elevation in obesity rates, resulting in a global health crisis. Major risk factors playing a critical role in the spread of obesity include high-fat food consumption, high-calorie foods, and insufficient physical activity. Diabetes is strongly linked with obesity in terms of metabolic abnormalities and physiological processes, including inflammation. Diabetes type 2 (T2D) is caused primarily by insulin resistance and insufficient insulin release from beta cells of the pancreas. An obese or overweight individual has a strong association with insulin resistance, which in turn leads to the development of T2D. Metabolic stress due to nutrient overload releases different types of inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and SFRP4) from adipose tissues in obesity. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is also an inflammatory mediator that impairs insulin secretion. SFRP4 acts as an early biomarker for diabesity expressed with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) in the adipose tissues that hinders the exocytosis of insulin-secreting granules from the pancreatic \u03b2-cells and is a potential target for preserving \u03b2-cell dysfunction and the diabesity treatment. In the current study, plant-based phytocompounds were identified and investigated in silico and in vivo for their ability to suppress the expression of SFRP4. In a diet-induced mouse model, short-listed compounds such as resveratrol and quercetin at higher and lower doses were found effective and significant in reducing the anti-inflammatory mediators and SFRP4 levels. Overall, the current study describes the expression of SFRP4, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, and its inhibition by various inhibitors. Moreover, the study's findings suggest that resveratrol and quercetin hold promise as potential treatments for diabesity."

While early studies focused on its role in immune cell development and tumor progression, recent studies have revealed that SWELL1 plays an important role in metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that SWELL1 is extensively involved in physiological processes in peripheral metabolic tissues, including adipocyte hypertrophy, skeletal muscle volume regulation, insulin secretion, and hepatic lipid metabolism through interactions with the insulin signaling pathway. These functions play key roles in the pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), suggesting that SWELL1 may be a new target for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In this review, we focus on the structural and functional characteristics of SWELL1 to provide an in-depth explanation of its role in the development of metabolic syndrome, especially the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway, and provide a basis for the development of therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases targeting SWELL1."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association was causal and whether body mass index mediated the effect of hypertension on lacunar stroke.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The independence and causal association of hypertension, obesity, and T2D with lacunar stroke were assessed by multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) and network Mendelian randomization (NMR) with inverse variance weighting (IVW). The reliability of the results was increased by sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger, Cochrane's Q test, Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and leave-one-out.

Our previous studies suggested that C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells promotes insulin secretion and cell survival. However, as C3aR1 is expressed on many other cell types including within the islets, whole-body C3aR1 knockout models confound the analyses of direct impacts on \u03b2 cells.\nMETHODS: To clarify the role of C3aR1 in \u03b2 cells under T2D conditions, we generated \u03b2 cell-specific C3aR1 knockout mice. We assessed glucose homeostasis, focusing on \u03b2 cell function and mass under metabolic stress conditions, to interrogate the effects of C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells in a mouse model of T2D. We performed proteomic analyses on islets from control and \u03b2 cell-specific C3aR1 knockout mice. To determine potential translational relevance, C3AR1 was assessed alongside glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets.\nRESULTS: We show that the complement receptor C3aR1 on \u03b2 cells plays an essential role in maintaining \u03b2 cell homeostasis, especially under the metabolic duress of obesity and T2D. Male mice with \u03b2 cell specific deletion of C3ar1 (\u03b2-C3aR1 KO) exhibit worse glucose tolerance and lower insulin levels when fed regular or high fat diet. Under high fat diet, \u03b2-C3aR1 KO also have diminished \u03b2 cell mass. Islets from \u03b2-C3aR1 KO mice demonstrate impaired insulin secretion. \u03b2 cells lacking C3aR1 display increased susceptibility to lipotoxicity-mediated cell death. Markers of \u03b2 cell identity are decreased in \u03b2-C3aR1 KO mice while stress markers are elevated. Disruption of C3ar1 on \u03b2 cells ablates the insulin secretory response to C3a, establishing a signaling axis between C3a and \u03b2 cell-derived C3aR1. Islet proteomic analyses highlight the MAPK pathway and mitochondrial dysfunction with C3aR1 loss in \u03b2 cells. Finally, we show that C3AR1 is positively correlated with insulin secretion in human islets.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that C3aR1 expression on \u03b2 cells is necessary to maintain optimal \u03b2 cell function and preserve \u03b2 cell mass in T2D."

We highlight trends and hurdles in the FAM intervention pyramid. Our viewpoint is to indicate how interventions might change the future demand for specific food groups, their transport in supply chains, and the technologies used to process them. Based on national guidelines, dietary interventions can help to prevent and treat many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. FAM R&D and services offer more individualized treatments. This is challenging given the inter-individual variability and complexity of the body's response to food and related factors, such as dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, and biosphere. Quantifying health improvements is essential to prove the added value of more individualized FAM interventions compared to adopting a general healthy diet. It is unclear which level of individualization of interventions produces the largest health benefits at the lowest costs for the patient, healthcare system, and climate. FAM interventions can support and complement conventional medical treatment. They will require a shift to producing more health-promoting foods, including whole foods, minimally-processed foods, and selected processed foods. The food processing industry and supply chains must adapt to these new scenarios.

            "abstract": "Excessive lipid accumulation can lead to obesity, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, there are currently few drugs that could effectively and safely inhibit the accumulation of intracellular lipids. In this study, we observed that baicalin significantly altered cellular respiration by reducing mitochondrial oxygen consumption while enhancing glycolytic flux, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, suggesting an adaptation to altered energy availability. Baicalin effectively reduced lipid droplet formation and intracellular triglyceride levels in adipocytes, as marked by downregulating genes and proteins associated with lipid storage, including Cd36, Fabp4, and FASN. Transcriptomic analysis identified 2150 differentially expressed genes in baicalin-treated adipocytes, with significant enrichment in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid metabolism. Further analysis revealed that baicalin upregulated glycolytic and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (FAO) pathways while downregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase, inducing a shift toward glycolysis and FAO for energy production. Molecular docking analysis revealed that Adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1) was the target of baicalin, which inhibited the maturation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and finally alleviated lipid deposition. These results demonstrate that baicalin induces metabolic reprogramming of adipocytes by inhibiting glucose aerobic metabolism while enhancing anaerobic glycolysis and FAO. Meanwhile, baicalin targets ADORA1, which subsequently influences the processing of SREBP1 and downregulates lipid biosynthesis, positioning baicalin as a potential therapeutic agent against obesity and related metabolic disorders."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of bile acids on a PCOS rat model and explore the underlying mechanisms involved.\nMETHODS: Morphological index evaluation, histopathological examination, and hormonal profiling were employed to assess the therapeutic effects of eight bile acids. A targeted proteomics was utilized to characterize and quantify highly homologous chemerin isoforms in rat serum. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to identify potential targets and molecular mechanisms involved. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the affinity between bile acids and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).\nRESULTS: Five of the eight bile acids markedly restored morphological indices, histopathological manifestations, hormonal imbalances, and chemerin isoform dysregulation. Notably, the therapeutic effects of TDCA and GUDCA on PCOS were reported for the first time. As the severity of the disease decreased, chemerin-157S was negatively correlated with progesterone (P4), estradiol (E2), antral follicles, and corpus luteum, respectively. Several chemerin-associated pathways have been identified via network pharmacology analysis. Additionally, a 7\u03b2-hydroxy group carried on the steroid skeleton of bile acids has been found to exhibit positive therapeutic efficacy in PCOS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Downregulating chemerin levels via specific bile acids may be a promising therapeutic strategy for PCOS patients."

The bioconversion process effectively generates distinct polysaccharide fractions, including high-molecular-weight dextran, isomaltomegalosaccharides (IMSs), and low-molecular-weight byproducts, each with unique structural properties. IMSs, characterized by a complex network of \u03b1-1,4 and \u03b1-1,6 linkages, demonstrated significantly reduced susceptibility to mammalian \u03b1-glucosidase and slower enzymatic hydrolysis rates compared to dextran. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations revealed that the polysaccharides modified through bioconversion, particularly the IMS-enriched fractions, effectively attenuated postprandial glucose spikes, prolonged glucose release, and sustained glucose availability. The unfractionated polysaccharides modified through bioconversion also showed promising potential for modulating glycemic responses, providing sustained energy release, and reducing the metabolic risks associated with hyperglycemia. Notably, this bioconversion process utilizes crude maltodextrins without requiring enzyme extraction or purified substrates, ensuring industrial scalability.

Most studies of these phenomena have focused on adult populations. We aimed to investigate the heritability and parent-of-origin effects on cardiometabolic traits in a birth cohort with serial measurements to determine whether these patterns emerged early in life.\nMETHODS: The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study comprises a birth cohort in which offspring and parents were studied from birth and followed up for 24\u00a0years. We investigated parent-of-origin effects on cardiometabolic traits cross-sectionally at available timepoints using linear regression, and longitudinally across the life course using mixed-effect regression. Maternal and paternal effects on offspring phenotype were modelled after adjusting for age, sex and BMI. Parent-of-origin effects were calculated based on the difference between maternal and paternal effects. We also investigated these effects in another birth cohort, that of the Pune Children's Study. Genetic parent-of-origin effects were assessed using generalised estimating equations after taking the parental origin of the alleles into account.\nRESULTS: Birthweight showed a maternal parent-of-origin effect. At 24\u00a0years, maternal bias was seen for some obesity-related traits for daughters, while paternal bias was seen for WHR in sons. A shift from paternal bias at 6\u00a0years to maternal bias at 24\u00a0years for the skinfold thickness was observed in daughters. Fasting glucose and lipids showed maternal bias at 6, 12 and 24\u00a0years. For fasting insulin and HOMA2-S, a negative maternal effect at 6\u00a0years transitioned to a positive one at 12\u00a0years. For HOMA2-B, a paternal effect at 6\u00a0years transitioned to a maternal one at 12\u00a0years, and this remained so at 24\u00a0years. Some of these findings were also observed in the cohort from the Pune Children's Study. Longitudinal modelling revealed stronger paternal effects over time for fasting insulin and HOMA indices but maternal effects for glucose and lipids, reflecting their cumulative effect over time. Genetic variants at the KCNQ1 locus showed a maternal parent-of-origin effect on birthweight, on HOMA2-B at 12\u00a0years, and on lipids at 6 and 12\u00a0years.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study provides proof of concept of the existence of parent-of-origin effects on cardiometabolic traits from birth, through childhood and puberty, until adult age. Our results indicate a predominantly maternal influence on intrauterine, pubertal and reproductive-age metabolism in the offspring. While the longitudinal analysis indicated a maternal bias for the macronutrients (glucose and lipids), and a paternal bias for glucose-insulin metabolism, the cross-sectional analysis revealed a transition between parental influence across physiological stages. This dynamic relationship may have its origins in the life-history theory of evolution, and could inform strategies for primordial prevention aimed at curbing the rising burden of cardiometabolic disease. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying such effects."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The use of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists has been associated with gastroparesis, but little is known about the risk of gastroparesis in those with obesity but without type 2 diabetes (T2D), and how that risk compares with other treatment modalities for obesity. This study aims to characterise the relationship between different treatment modalities for obesity and the risk of gastroparesis in a population without pre-existing T2D.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Merative MarketScan Research Databases of individuals with obesity who underwent treatment with semaglutide, bupropion-naltrexone or sleeve gastrectomy from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022. The incidence of gastroparesis diagnosis was evaluated using International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 codes. The risk of gastroparesis was compared between three intervention groups using Cox proportional hazards regression models.\nRESULTS: Of the 55\u2009460 individuals included, 36\u2009990 (66.7%) were treated with semaglutide, 7369 (13.3%) with bupropion-naltrexone and 11\u2009101 (13.7%) with sleeve gastrectomy. Gastroparesis rates among those treated with semaglutide versus bupropion-naltrexone versus sleeve gastrectomy were 6.5 per 1000 person-years (PY) vs 2.1 per 1000 PY vs 1.1 per 1000 PY, respectively. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, individuals treated with semaglutide had a higher risk of gastroparesis than those treated with bupropion-naltrexone (adjusted HR 3.33, 95%\u2009CI 2.27, 4.98) and sleeve gastrectomy (adjusted HR 6.14, 95%\u2009CI 3.94, 9.57).\nCONCLUSIONS: There is an increased incidence of gastroparesis among individuals with obesity without T2D who are using semaglutide as compared with bupropion-naltrexone and sleeve gastrectomy. Understanding these potential side effects, though rare, may help guide personalised treatment regimens."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are emerging with therapeutic agents for the treatment of two of the most prevalent metabolic disorders: diabetes and obesity. However, the causal relationship between GLP-1R agonists and autoimmune diseases is still unclear.\nMETHODS: The available cis-eQTLs for drug target genes (GLP-1Rs) were used as proxies for exposure to GLP-1R agonists. Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were used as positive controls to ensure the reliability of the genetic instrument. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to reveal the causal association of genetic proxy GLP-1R agonists with 18 autoimmune diseases from the IEU OpenGwas database and FinnGen database. Finally, the results of the two databases were analyzed via meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 22 significant cis-eQTL single-nucleotide polymorphisms were included as genetic instruments. Positive control analysis revealed that GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with obesity (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.826, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and T2DM (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.886, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which is consistent with the meta-analysis. MR analysis revealed that increased expression of the GLP-1R gene has a significant protective effect on type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), hypothyroidism, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the MR analysis suggested that increased expression of GLP-1R agonists may increase the risk of Graves' disease (GD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and psoriasis. Our findings were consistent with those of the meta-analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into potential adjuvant treatments for autoimmune diseases from the perspective of genetic variation and provides evidence for the safety of GLP-1R agonists."

The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in TCF7L2 in T2D interacts with dietary factors; however, research on nutrigenetics among Saudi Arabians is limited. This study investigated the interaction between the SNP rs7903146 and dietary intake on factors that may contribute to MetS among Saudi Arabian adults.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 271 adult participants (aged 20-55\u202fyears) of both genders with or without overweight or obesity (body mass index between 18-35 kg/m2). Anthropometric measurements and dietary assessments using a food frequency questionnaire were performed. Fasting blood samples were collected to analyze serum lipid, glucose, and insulin levels. Genetic analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Univariate regression was used to examine the association between the TCF7L2 SNP rs7903146 and laboratory parameters, and to test SNP-diet interactions. The additive model was used in the analysis and the T allele was the effect allele.\nRESULTS: A marginal significant association was observed between SNP rs7903146 and waist circumference (WC) (p\u202f=\u202f0.05). Carriers of TT genotype had the highest WC (83.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.1\u202fcm), when compared with the CC genotype (80\u202f\u00b1\u202f14.2\u202fcm) and the TC genotype (77.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f13.9\u202fcm). The SNP rs7903146 was significantly associated with total energy intake (p\u202f=\u202f0.04) and saturated fatty acids (SFA, p\u202f=\u202f0.005), and TT carriers had the highest total energy and SFA consumption (3606.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1554.7\u202fkcal, 66.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f52.0\u202fg, respectively). Only one near significant interaction was observed between SNP rs7903146 and total energy intake on insulin levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.04), with carriers of the TT genotype showed a greater reduction in insulin values (-5.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.5) at lower energy intake when compared with the CC (-2.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.1), and TC (-4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.8). No significant interaction was found.\nCONCLUSION: The present study observed significant associations between SNP rs7903146 and total energy and SFA consumptions. The TT carriers had increased consumption of total energy and SFA. Future studies using larger sample sizes are required to confirm significant interaction between SNP rs7903146 and diet on factors that may contribute to MetS in the Saudi population."

            "abstract": "Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is one of two incretin hormones playing key roles in the control of food intake, nutrient assimilation, insulin secretion and whole-body metabolism. Recent pharmacological advances and clinical trials show that unimolecular co-agonists that target the receptors for the incretins - GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) - offer more effective treatment strategies for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) compared with GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists alone, suggesting previously underappreciated roles of GIP in regulating food intake and body weight. The mechanisms by which GIP regulates energy balance remain controversial as both agonism and antagonism of the GIP receptor (GIPR) produce weight loss and improve metabolic outcomes in preclinical models. Recent studies have shown that GIPR signalling in the central nervous system (CNS), especially in regions of the brain that regulate energy balance, is essential for its action on appetite regulation. This finding has sparked interest in understanding the mechanisms by which GIP engages brain circuits to reduce food intake and body weight. In this review, we present key knowledge around the actions of GIP on food intake regulation and the potential mechanisms by which GIPR and GIPR/GLP1R agonists may regulate energy balance."

NCT01055093) underwent clinical examination and cluster analysis to identify phenotype-based diabetes subtypes, using BMI, age, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, homoeostasis model estimates and islet autoantibodies. Colour fundus photography, optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography were performed within the first year of diabetes diagnosis (baseline) and at 5 year intervals up to year 10. Age- and sex-adjusted participants served as control participants (n=105). Perfusion density, vessel density, presence of retinal microaneurysms in superficial, intermediate and deep capillary plexus (SCP, ICP, DCP), choriocapillaris flow deficit density (CC FD) and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) of the macula as well as retinal layer thickness, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were analysed.\nRESULTS: Perfusion density and vessel density of SCP were already reduced at baseline in type 2 diabetes (expected difference compared with control participants: -0.0071, p=0.0276, expected difference: -0.0034, p=0.0184, respectively), especially in participants with severe insulin-deficient and mild obesity-related diabetes. At year 10 only perfusion density of the SCP and DCP was reduced in both type 1 and 2 diabetes (p=0.0365, p=0.0062, respectively). The FAZ was enlarged and the CC FD within the first year increased in type 1 (p=0.0327, p=0.0474, respectively) and more markedly in type 2 diabetes (p=0.0006, p<0.0001). The occurrence of microaneurysms in SCP and DCP was significant at year 5 (p=0.0209, p=0.0279, respectively) and year 10 (p=0.0220, p=0.0007). Presence of microaneurysms in SCP and DCP was associated with decreases in perfusion density and vessel density in both SCP and ICP. Furthermore, microaneurysms were associated with decreased ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer thickness.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetes already reduces macular perfusion SCP at time of clinical diagnosis, while long-standing diabetes affects both SCP and DCP. The FAZ of the SCP and the CC FD are early indicators of diabetic alterations, with more pronounced changes observed in type 2 diabetes. Microaneurysms in the macular plexus are associated with a decrease of ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer. Subclinical microangiopathy occurs prior to manifestation of diabetic retinopathy, disease-related visual acuity impairment or inner retinal layer thinning."

Studying how genetic liability for psychiatric disorders relate to CMD risk will offer novel insight into the relationship between psychiatric disorders and CMDs.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between psychiatric polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and clinically diagnosed CMDs while accounting for cross-disorder pleiotropy.\nDESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study computed PRSs for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The analysis was conducted in three population-based Northern European cohorts: the Swedish Twin Registry (STR, N=17,378 genotyped samples), the Estonian Biobank (EstBB, N=208,383), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa, N=129,398). Associations between psychiatric PRSs and clinical diagnoses of 10 major CMDs (including metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertensive disease, arteriosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and arrhythmias) were estimated using models that mutually adjusted for all psychiatric PRSs. Supplementary analyses were performed by additionally controlling for self-reported body mass index (BMI). A discordant twin-pair analysis was conducted in the STR (N=70,619) to assess the association between self-reported lifetime MDD and subsequent CMD risk while adjusting for familial factors shared between monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Psychiatric PRSs were constructed based on both all available genetic risk variants and genome-wide significant risk variants from large-scale GWASs. Clinical diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and CMDs were ascertained through electronic health records (with primary care records used exclusively in the EstBB). Lifetime self-reported MDD in the STR was assessed via the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form.\nRESULTS: PRSs for ADHD and MDD were associated with increased risk of all CMDs. The ADHD PRS showed stronger associations with metabolic disease, whereas the MDD PRS showed stronger associations with cardiovascular diseases. PRSs for anxiety disorder, PTSD, and bipolar disorder showed only limited associations with CMDs, while increased levels of schizophrenia PRSs were associated with decreased risk of CMDs. These associations remained after adjustment for BMI. Finally, twins endorsing lifetime MDD were found to have an increased risk of subsequent CMD diagnoses compared to their unexposed co-twins.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PRSs for ADHD and MDD showed robust associations with risk of CMDs and self-reported MDD was associated with subsequent CMD risk even after adjusting for familial factors shared between co-twins. These findings provide robust evidence for genetic overlap between ADHD and MDD with CMDs."

The Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is widely used to estimate IR, but there is no consensus on the optimal cutoff values for identifying individuals at risk. This study aims to compare two methodologies, percentile distributions and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, for determining optimal HOMA-IR cutoff values in a population from Mexico City. Methods This cross-sectional study included 765 adults recruited from a hospital outpatient clinic in Mexico City. Participants were divided into two groups: a reference group of individuals with healthy weight and fasting plasma glucose and a MetS group of overweight or obese individuals classified based on the presence or absence of MetS. HOMA-IR values were analyzed using the 75th percentile in the reference group and ROC curve analysis in the MetS group. Optimal cutoffs were determined using the Youden index. Results We include a total of 765 patients, 218 subjects in the reference group and 547 for the ROC curve\u00a0analysis. HOMA-IR percentiles 75th and 90th were 2.72 and 3.71, respectively. ROC curve analysis yielded higher cutoff values for MetS diagnosis than the percentile-based method. The percentile-based approach allowed for earlier identification of individuals at risk, including those without clinical manifestations of MetS. Conclusions This study highlights the variability in HOMA-IR cutoff values across methodologies and emphasizes the importance of population-specific reference values. A percentile-based approach proves effective for early detection of IR, facilitating preventive interventions during the preclinical stage. These findings support using percentile-based cutoffs as a practical tool for improving risk assessment and guiding clinical decision-making."

            "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have emerged as key therapeutic agents in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, offering benefits that extend beyond glycemic control. This review examines the role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in modulating cardiac autonomic function, with a particular focus on heart rate variability (HRV) as a biomarker of autonomic balance. These agents improve metabolic profiles through enhanced glucosuria, natriuresis, and weight loss, while concurrently reducing blood pressure. Importantly, they also attenuate sympathetic nervous system overactivity and promote parasympathetic modulation, which may lower the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. The underlying mechanisms include not only the metabolic effects but also anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions, which together contribute to improved endothelial function and vascular health. Advanced HRV analyses, encompassing traditional time and frequency domain methods as well as nonlinear approaches, have proven valuable in detecting early autonomic dysfunction in high-risk populations. Some studies suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors may be associated with improvements in HRV parameters, such as increased SDNN and RMSSD and a reduced LF/HF ratio. However, findings are inconsistent across studies, and further research is needed to determine the extent and mechanisms of these potential effects. Although these findings are promising, further standardized, long-term studies are essential to clarify the mechanisms and optimal therapeutic strategies involving SGLT-2 inhibitors in the management of autonomic dysfunction. Future research should also explore the synergistic potential of combining SGLT-2 inhibitors with other cardiometabolic therapies to enhance cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with and without T2DM."

Logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios.\nRESULTS: Exposure to 0, 1, 2 or 3 or more types of CM showed graded associations for depression, anxiety, self-harm and PTSD in adulthood. Irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia and obesity showed modest correlations. No significant associations were found between CM and ischemic heart disease (IHD), type 2 diabetes or cancer, although the ORs were in line with several previous ACE studies. When exposure to severe violence in adulthood was added to CM, odds ratios increased dramatically for mental health problems and health-related risk behaviors, suggesting that revictimization may moderate or mediate this relationship.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the importance of studying violence exposure in a life-course perspective and suggest that the relationship between childhood adversities and long-term physical health problems in adulthood may be affected by the traumatic effects of revictimization in adult life. This points to the importance of early identification of child maltreatment and provision of robust services to protect children, treat symtoms of trauma, and enhance resilience to decrease the risk of poor health outcomes."

Significant sex differences have been identified in the prevalence, development, and pathophysiology of obesity and T2D; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to identify sex-specific signatures in obesity and T2D and enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with sex differences by integrating expression data. We performed a systematic review and individual transcriptomic analysis of eight selected studies which included 302 subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. Then, we conducted different gene-level meta-analyses and functional characterizations for obesity and T2D separately, identifying common and sex-specific transcriptional profiles, many of which were previously associated with obesity or T2D. The obesity meta-analysis yielded nineteen differentially-expressed genes from a sex-specific perspective (e.g., SPATA18, KREMEN1, NPY4R, and PRM3), while a comparison of the expression profiles between sexes in T2D prompted the identification and validation of specific transcriptomic signatures in males (SAMD9, NBPF3, LDHD, and EHD3) and females (RETN, HEY1, PLPP2, and PM20D2). At the functional level, we highlighted the fundamental role of the Wnt pathway in the development of obesity and T2D in females, and the roles of mitochondrial damage and free fatty acids in males. Overall, our sex-specific meta-analyses supported the detection of differentially expressed genes in males and females associated with the development of obesity and further T2D development, emphasizing the relevance of sex-based information in biomedical data and opening new avenues for research."

Our team has recently identified hexosaminidase\u00a0A (HEXA) as an endocrine factor secreted by the liver that regulates sphingolipid metabolism in skeletal muscle. Specifically, HEXA converts GM2 to GM3 gangliosides within cell-surface lipid rafts. Remodelling of ganglioside composition by HEXA enhances IGF1 signalling in skeletal muscle, increasing muscle glucose uptake and improving blood glucose control.\nMETHODS: We produced a long-acting HEXA-FC fusion protein (murine HEXA and the fragment crystallisable [FC] region from IgG1) and evaluated the effects of chronic bi-weekly HEXA-FC administration (1 mg/kg body weight) on glycaemic control in C57BL/6 mice with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and the db/db mouse model of severe type 2 diabetes. Outcome measures included glucose and insulin tolerance, including a stable isotope-labelled GTT and assessment of tissue-specific glucose disposal, as well as proteomics analysis to define changes in skeletal muscle metabolism.\nRESULTS: Chronic administration of a long-acting recombinant HEXA-FC fusion protein led to improvements in random blood glucose, fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance, driven by increased glucose disposal into skeletal muscle, effects that were associated with enhancement of IGF1 signalling in muscle.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Given that skeletal muscle is a primary site of insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes, HEXA-FC protein therapy may open new avenues for therapeutic advancement in type 2 diabetes."

PCOS significantly increases cardiovascular risk by predisposing individuals to various subclinical and clinical conditions, including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, it interacts synergistically with other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Several molecular mechanisms involving genetics, epigenetics, adipokine secretion, hyperandrogenemia, and hyperinsulinemia play a role in the relationship between PCOS and these comorbidities. For instance, androgen excess has been implicated in the development of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, endothelial dysfunction, and ultimately, broader cardiovascular disease. A deeper understanding of these underlying mechanisms facilitates the development of diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies directed at reducing cardiometabolic morbidity.

These conditions encompass dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. This review therefore analyzes the usefulness of c-miRNAs as therapeutic markers over the past decades. It also provides an update on c-miRNAs associated with general obesity and overweight, as well as with the most prevalent pathologies in the adult population. It also examines the effect of different nutritional approaches and physical activity regarding the activity of miRNAs in circulation in adults with overweight or general obesity. All of this is done with the aim of evaluating their potential use as biomarkers in various research contexts related to overweight and obesity in adults."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatty pancreas disease (FPD) is characterized by abnormal fat accumulation in pancreatic tissue and is often associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While its pathophysiology and impact on pancreatic functions have been explored, the interplay between FPD, glycemic control, and exocrine dysfunction in T2DM remains inadequately defined. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of FPD, the factors affecting it, and its relationship with endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions in newly diagnosed T2DM.\nMETHODS: A total of 126 individuals were included in the study, comprising 63 newly diagnosed T2DM patients and 63 healthy controls matched for age, sex, body mass index and body fat distribution. Body composition, biochemical parameters (glucose, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c), fecal elastase levels, and pancreatic/hepatic steatosis grades (evaluated using ultrasonography) were assessed.\nRESULTS: Newly diagnosed T2DM patients presented significantly higher hepatic steatosis grades (p\u2009=\u20090.018) and lower fecal elastase levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001) compared to controls. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was more prevalent in the T2DM group (p\u2009<\u20090,001). A positive correlation was observed between the FPD grade, hepatic steatosis grade, and hepatic fat fraction. A negative and statistically significant correlation (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed between FPD grade and fecal elastase level (r\u2009=\u2009-0.264). HbA1c levels demonstrated a nonlinear (inverse U-shaped) relationship with FPD, peaking at 9.8% and declining thereafter, while showing a continuous negative relationship with fecal elastase levels. HbA1c predicted low fecal elastase (<\u2009200\u00a0\u03bcg/g) with a cutoff value of 7.4%. Patients with HbA1c levels\u2009>\u20099.8% presented with reduced FPD alongside persistent exocrine insufficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fatty pancreas disease is closely associated with hepatic steatosis, glycemic control, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction in newly diagnosed T2DM patients. The interplay between FPD, glycemic control, and exocrine dysfunction highlights the need for comprehensive metabolic assessments in this population."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Kangaroo mother care which involves skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between mothers and newborns with support for exclusive breastfeeding, is an important innovation if practiced beyond the first week of life up to 1-year of age. We posit that extended SSC can benefit postpartum metabolic health.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Using a narrative literature review, we examine the interaction between hormones oxytocin and cortisol, which are either released or antagonized by the neural actions of skin-to-skin contact.\nRESULTS: Oxytocin is released during SSC, which promotes attachment, improves parent-infant interactions and lowers levels of cortisol. No studies to date have reported SSC use beyond the first 5 to 7 weeks postpartum. Although no differences have been observed in infant body weight, increased head circumference has been noted among pre-term and low birth weight infants. Improved breastfeeding outcomes have also been observed. Oxytocin release is protective against type-2 diabetes and obesity in postpartum women, given its effects on \u03b2-cell function, improved insulin response and reduction of plasma glucose levels. Oxytocin has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and thermoregulatory effects. Hypothetical benefits due to oxytocin-cortisol dynamics, can be assumed for maternal posttraumatic stress, postpartum depression and anxiety. Sleep patterns, duration of crying and length of sleep are dose-dependent in effect. Postnatal skin-brain connection and thermoregulation via epidermal keratinocytes may mediate the relationship between SSC and autism spectrum disorder.\nCONCLUSIONS: The extended use of SSC can lower dependence on pharmacotherapeutic options concerning postpartum mental health and galactagogue use while supporting maternal-infant psychosocial well-being and lowering stress via hormonal action and HPA-axis activation."

Probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lb41 (Lb41) has not been reported to have hepatoprotective effects. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the preventive effects of Lb41 against NAFLD in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice for preventing NAFLD.\nMETHOD: To induce fatty liver, the mice were given HFD for 5 weeks, followed by silymarin (200 mg/kg) or Lb41 (108 or 109 colony forming units/day) with the HFD for 7 weeks. After 12 weeks, body weight, histological change, serum and hepatic lipid profiles, etc. was performed compared to control and silymarin.\nRESULTS: Lb41 had significantly reduced body weight (4.87 g) and serum lipids (triglycerides (77.64%), total cholesterol (67.53%), and low-density lipoprotein (40.50%) compared with the HFD group (P < 0.05). Lb41 significantly relieved HFD-associated hepatic injury by reducing aspartate transaminase (0.49-0.57 fold), alanine transaminase (0.49-0.51 fold), and alkaline phosphatase (0.76-0.90 fold) (P < 0.05). Additionally, they had decreased expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and increased the expression levels of acyl-CoA oxidase, PPAR\u03b1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1, and fatty acid synthase in liver cells. Insulin and leptin levels decreased in the Lb41 treatment group compared with those in the HFD group. Meanwhile, adiponectin levels increased, similar to those in the normal diet group.\nCONCLUSION: Based on these findings, Lb41 probiotics have possible hepatoprotective effects and could be used as functional food materials."

The review evaluates contemporary data about how GDM affects long-term health results. We searched published studies from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. A total of 710 records were identified, with 173 duplicates and 61 irrelevant records removed, leaving 476 for screening. After excluding 282, 194 reports were sought for retrieval, 97 were not retrieved, 97 were assessed for eligibility, 85 were excluded, and 12 studies were included in the review.\u00a0Women with GDM face higher risks of type 2 diabetes (HR 2.5-7.1), hypertension (HR 3.2), and metabolic syndrome (HR 4.1). Their offspring have increased risks of obesity (OR 2.9), insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders from childhood to adolescence. This review examines early detection biomarkers alongside strategies like lactation,\u00a0probiotics, and CRP levels to potentially reduce maternal GDM risks. Although research had some methodological limitations regarding diagnostic irregularities and variable follow-up durations the findings demonstrate that early identification of GDM matters alongside customized care plans and long-term monitoring of women's health status.

This study estimated the clinical and economic impact of updated 2023/24 Moderna COVID-19 vaccination among high-risk adults versus no 2023/24 vaccination and versus updated Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination.\nMETHODS: A static Markov model was adapted for high-risk adults, including immunocompromised (IC), chronic lung disease (CLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) populations in the United States (US).\nRESULTS: Vaccination with the updated Moderna vaccine at current coverage rates was estimated to prevent considerable COVID-19 hospitalizations in CLD (101,309), DM (97,358), CVD (47,830), IC (14,834), and CKD (13,558) populations versus no 2023/24 vaccination. Vaccination also provided net medical cost-savings of US$399 million (M)-2129M (healthcare payer) and $457M-2531M (societal perspective), depending on population. The return-on-investment was positive across all conditions ($1.10-$2.60 gain for every $1 invested). Healthcare savings increased with a relative 10% increase in current vaccination coverage ($439M-$2342M), and from meeting US 2030 targets of 70% coverage ($1096M-$5707M). Based on higher vaccine effectiveness observed in real-world evidence studies, updated Moderna vaccination was estimated to prevent additional COVID-19 hospitalizations in DM (13,105), CLD (10,359), CVD (6241), IC (1979), and CKD (942) versus Pfizer/BioNTech's updated vaccine, with healthcare payer and societal cost-savings, making it the dominant strategy. Healthcare savings per patient vaccinated with Moderna versus Pfizer/BioNTech's updated vaccine were $31.00-$59.00, depending on population. Results were robust across sensitivity/scenario analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Updated 2023/24 Moderna COVID-19 vaccination was estimated to provide significant health benefits through prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk populations, and cost-savings to healthcare payers and society, versus no 2023/24 vaccination and updated Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination. Increasing current low COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates was estimated to be cost-saving while preventing many more severe infections and hospitalizations in these high-risk populations.

            "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), emerged as a global health crisis in late 2019, triggering unprecedented government actions worldwide. COVID-19 mortality varied based on many factors, with this study focusing on socioeconomic status and healthcare quality across 95 countries. Countries were classified by gross national income (GNI) per capita into high-income (HI), upper-middle-income (UMI), lower-middle-income (LMI), and low-income (LI) countries. Data were collected from databases in 2023, including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, percent vaccination, infant mortality rate (IMR), and population density. The findings revealed that HI and UMI countries experienced significantly higher mortality rates compared to LMI and LI groups. Economic status, measured by GDP per capita, demonstrated a strong negative correlation with mortality in HI countries (Spearman's r=-0.562; p&lt;0.001) but a strong positive correlation in LMI countries (Spearman's r=0.629; p=0.002). Vaccination coverage showed a significant strong negative correlation with mortality in HI countries (Spearman's r=-0.551; p&lt;0.001), underscoring the importance of widespread vaccination in reducing mortality. IMR exhibited a very strong negative correlation with mortality in LMI countries (Spearman's r=-0.704; p&lt;0.001), an unexpected finding warranting further investigation. No such correlation was observed in other groups. Population density showed no significant impact on mortality rates across all income groups (p\u22650.05). These results highlight the importance of economic resources and vaccination efforts in reducing COVID-19 mortality, while population density showed no impact. Our research provides insights to guide future public health responses."

We included 264 and 132 age- and sex-matched patients without im-RD in matched-I and matched-II control groups, respectively. The median age of patients and controls was 48.5 years, and 74.2% were female. Patients with im-RD were paired with an unforced nearest neighbor match using a caliper width of 0.2 standard deviations of the matched-II control group's propensity score. We compared the relative risk of death, disease progress, use of medical resources, and financial impact of COVID-19 between patients and controls.\nRESULTS: Patients with im-RD had higher mortality rates than the matched-I (odds ratio, OR: 11.2, p < 0.000) and matched-II (OR: 16.8, p < 0.006) control groups. The overall complication rate was also significantly higher in patients with im-RD than in matched-I (OR = 2.9, p < 0.000) and matched-II (OR = 2.8, P < 0.0001) control groups. Lastly, patients with im-RD required more frequent visits to the clinic, a longer recovery time following hospital discharge, and increased healthcare costs compared to the control groups.\nCONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in patients with im-RD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, exerting a significant burden on the healthcare system."

This has resulted in post-pandemic measles outbreaks globally, and those at risk in Sabah are the marginalised population, who encounter barriers when it comes to getting measles immunisation. In this study, a community-based intervention was implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based intervention in improving the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) completion rate and assessing the community's acceptance of and satisfaction with the proposed intervention programme.\nMETHOD: The study applied a cluster randomised control trial (RCT). The intervention involved trained community volunteers who were trained on the reminder and recall strategy to help ensure the completion of the MCV among children in the community, where three doses of measles vaccine were provided when they were 6, 9, and 12 months of age. The intervention was administered in five settlements over a period of six months. As a comparison, another five settlements were provided with regular vaccination health services. The rates of MCV completion between the intervention group versus control group that received regular vaccination health services were then compared. The community's acceptance of and satisfaction with the intervention were assessed using a validated Acceptability of Intervention Measure-Intervention Appropriateness Measure-Feasibility of Intervention Measure (AIM-IAM-FIM) and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 (CSQ- 8).\nRESULT: The findings of the study showed that the rate of completion of the three doses of measles vaccine was slightly higher among those who received the intervention (80.4%) with a lower percentage having received one dose (2.6%) and no dose at all compared to those who only received routine healthcare services. Furthermore, the odds of having completed the MCV increased by three times for those who received the intervention (AOR: 2.848, 95% CI: 0.176, 45.996), although it was not significant. There was also a six-fold increase in the satisfaction score among those who received the community-based intervention compared to those who received the routine vaccination services (p\u2009= < 0.001, 95% CI =\u20092.634, 8.919). Finally, the majority (97%) of those in the community accepted the implemented intervention.\nCONCLUSION: A community-based intervention has the potential to enhance the completion of MCV, but it has to be refined further to be successful. The findings of this study can provide information to policy makers and implementers of vaccination programmes regarding the importance of engaging marginalised communities and ensuring their acceptance of and satisfaction with the intervention to achieve the desired target.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry (ISRCTN12774704) on 17 th November 2023."

The 2-dose BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine effectively reduced infection and mortality rates, however, waning vaccine effectiveness necessitated the introduction of a third vaccine dose or booster.\nAIM: To assess the magnitude and longevity of booster-induced immunity, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral immune responses among Qatar's vulnerable craft and manual worker community. We also investigated the impact of prior naturally acquired immunity on booster vaccination efficacy.\nMETHODS: Seventy healthy participants were enrolled in the study, of whom half had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood samples were collected before and after booster vaccination to evaluate immune responses through SARS-CoV-2 specific ELISpots, IgG ELISA, neutralization assays, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping.\nRESULTS: T cell analysis revealed increased Th1 cytokine responses, marked by enhanced IFN-\u03b3 release, in recently infected participants, which was further enhanced by booster vaccination for up to 6-months. Furthermore, booster vaccination stimulated cytotoxic responses in infection-na\u00efve participants, characterized by granzyme B production. Both natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and booster vaccination induced robust and durable SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune responses, with high neutralizing antibody levels. Prior natural infection was also linked to an increased number of class-switched B cells prior to booster vaccination.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the importance of booster vaccination in enhancing anti-viral immunity across both infection-na\u00efve and previously infected individuals, enhancing distinct arms of the anti-viral immune response and prolonging naturally acquired immunity."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.1, which quickly became the predominant strain worldwide in early 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only burdened healthcare systems but has also led to a new emerging medical question whether chronic underlying diseases (CUDs) are associated with clinical characteristics of populations infected with Omicron BA.1. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of CUDs on the clinical characteristics of adult patients (APs) with Omicron BA.1 infection.\nMETHODS: We performed an analysis on 320 individuals who were admitted to Tianjin First Central Hospital for treatment in the initial largest outbreak of the Omicron variant BA.1 infection between January and February 2022 in Tianjin, China. Clinical data were collected during the treatment and recovery, including gender, age, vaccination, CUDs, clinical manifestations, and nucleic acid test. These data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software, version 22.0.\nRESULTS: Our findings suggest that 178 (56\u00a0%) out of 320 APs have CUDs at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. APs with CUDs have a higher median age [55 (40-62)] compared to APs without CUDs [38 (30-47)] and lower vaccination rates [158 (89\u00a0%)] compared to APs without CUDs [138 (97\u00a0%)]. Multivariable logistic regression results indicate that CUDs and advanced age (\u226560 years old) are unfavorable factors for the increase in the severity of Omicron BA.1 infection [age (\u226560 years old), OR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.35-6.50, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; CUDs, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.78, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.65-4.70, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001]. Meanwhile, we observe that APs with CUDs exhibit significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and higher re-detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive (RP) rates, while notably reduced lymphocyte levels compared with those without CUDs. Additionally, we propose that vaccination played a positive role in reducing IL-6 and CRP levels, and RP rates, as well as increasing SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels in APs with CUDs.\nCONCLUSION: This research not only enhances the understanding of the association between CUDs and the clinical manifestations of APs infected with Omicron BA.1, but also offers valuable insights for preventing and managing Omicron BA.1 infections in this demographic. Moreover, it supports the policy of prioritizing vaccination for adults with CUDs."

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment patterns for noninfectious uveitis (NIU).\nDESIGN: Retrospective interrupted time series (ITS) analysis using Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a national deidentified health care database in the United States with administrative claims and electronic health record data.\nPARTICIPANTS: Individuals with a new diagnosis of NIU from December 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020, with continuous enrollment \u22651 year before this diagnosis.\nMETHODS: This study was divided into 3 time periods: prepandemic (December 1, 2017-November 30, 2019), early pandemic (March 1, 2020-December 31, 2020), and postvaccine period (January 1, 2021-September 30, 2021) corresponding to time before the pandemic, during the pandemic when no COVID-19 vaccine was available, and after widespread utilization of the vaccine began. Normalized prescription rates of uveitis therapies were modeled as an ITS. In the time-to-treatment analysis, Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine differences in likelihood of different modalities between time periods.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Temporal trends in the initial therapeutic choice for NIU.\nRESULTS: This study included 22\u00a0444 patients with a new NIU diagnosis. The average age was 61.9 (standard deviation 17.5) years, and 59.3% were female. There were no significant temporal breaks in prescribing trends for topical, local, and systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics) between pandemic periods (all P\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05) in ITS analysis.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccination is key for mitigating the impact of recurring seasonal influenza epidemics. Despite the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccines, achieving optimal vaccination uptake remains a challenge. This study aimed to explore the determinants of influenza vaccination uptake using data from Influweb, the Italian node of the Influenzanet participatory surveillance network.\nMETHODS: This study utilizes a longitudinal dataset of self-reported vaccination statuses from Italian participants across the 2011-2021 flu seasons. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with vaccination uptake. Post-stratification weights were applied to account for demographic differences between the Influweb sample and the general population.\nRESULTS: The analysis reveals that individuals using public transport and those living with minors are less likely to receive the influenza vaccination. On the other hand, university-educated individuals, and those on medication for chronic diseases are more likely to be vaccinated. Age also plays a role: individuals aged 44 and under are less likely to vaccinate compared to those aged 45-65, while those over 65 are more likely to do so. Furthermore, higher cumulative influenza-like illness incidence rates within a macro-region are associated with increased vaccination uptake. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in influenza vaccination uptake. Comparison of the Influweb data to vaccination rates reported by the Italian Health Ministry revealed higher coverage for self-reported vaccination. This could be linked to the voluntary nature of the survey, possibly attracting a more health-conscious cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study found that individuals living with minors and those relying on public transportation have lower odds of being vaccinated, despite having a higher documented risk of respiratory virus exposure. These findings highlight the importance of continued public health efforts targeting vulnerable groups and raising awareness about the risks of forgoing vaccination. The complex interplay of socioeconomic, demographic, and public health context significantly shapes vaccination decisions, emphasizing the need for tailored public health campaigns."

This study examines the dynamics of Omicron in Germany, France, and Italy by employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks to estimate the temporal parameters influencing its spread. We validated the performance of our model using the Root Mean Squared Percent Error (RMSPE). Our analysis revealed significant correlations between specific viral mutations-S371F, T376A, D405N, and R408S-and increased transmission rates in all three countries. These mutations, prevalent in the Omicron BA.2 and BA.3 sublineages, are linked to immune evasion and heightened transmissibility."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with sickle cell disease were presumed to be at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes due to their compromised immunity and chronic comorbidities. This study aimed to evaluate vaccination patterns, healthcare utilization, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of sickle cell disease patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro.\nMETHODS: A total of 289 over 18-year-old patients from the Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS-III) Brazil sickle cell disease cohort were followed between January 2021 and August 2023. Sociodemographic data, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, mortality rates, and COVID-19 vaccination status were collected. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for symptomatic or hospitalized patients.\nRESULTS: Of the participants, 89.2% completed the primary vaccination schedule, 62.2% received the first booster, 30% the second booster, and 4.1% completed all five doses. Emergency visits increased slightly during the pandemic but were primarily due to vaso-occlusive crises. Of the 119 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, six were positive, presenting mild symptoms with no COVID-19-related deaths. Vaccination rates in the cohort were similar to those in the general population, with Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer being the most used vaccines.\nDISCUSSION: The findings suggest that COVID-19 infection was not a significant trigger for vaso-occlusive crises or severe disease outcomes. High vaccination adherence likely played a key role in preventing severe COVID-19, alongside other factors such as social isolation and herd immunity. However, the overlap between symptoms of vaso-occlusive crises and COVID-19 may have caused diagnostic challenges. Importantly, the low morbidity and mortality observed emphasize the protective effect of vaccines, despite the presence of thromboplastic activity and pro-inflammatory states inherent to sickle cell disease. Addressing vaccine hesitancy remains crucial, particularly as booster doses show declining adherence.\nCONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a limited clinical impact on this cohort, with no significant role in triggering vaso-occlusive crises or severe outcomes. High vaccination rates and potential environmental or biological factors may have contributed to this protective effect."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Potentially preventable hospitalizations are inpatient admissions for a standard set of selected acute illnesses and chronic conditions that might have been avoided with preventive care or outpatient management. During 2010-2012, Alaska Native adults had higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations compared to other adults in Alaska. We evaluated potentially preventable hospitalizations among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults in the United States during 2016-2021.\nMETHODS: We used hospital discharge data from the Indian Health Service National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) to calculate and compare average annual age-adjusted rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations per 1000 AI/AN adults for two acute conditions (community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection) and four chronic conditions (diabetes, heart failure, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension).\nRESULTS: Of 310,889 hospitalizations among AI/AN adults, 40,400 (13\u00a0%) were defined as potentially preventable for an annual rate of 7.6 per 1000 persons. Rates were stable during 2016-2019 (8.7 per 1000) but declined during 2020-2021 (5.9 per 1000), likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults and rural residents had significantly higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations across all six conditions assessed, with community-acquired pneumonia having the highest hospitalization rate among adults aged \u226565\u00a0years (5.2 per 1000).\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeted preventive care and appropriate outpatient management for AI/AN elders living in rural areas might help improve health and reduce medical costs through decreased hospitalizations. Vaccination against respiratory infections could have the greatest impact in reducing preventable hospitalizations among AI/AN adults."

Studies which compare post-COVID-19 PFT to pre-illness measurements are scarce. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of COVID-19 on PFT soon after infection.\nMETHODS: In this prospective observational study, PFT were measured early following recovery from COVID-19 among healthy military aircrew. Spirometry values were compared to pre-COVID-19 measurements, and abnormality rates of lung volumes and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were assessed.\nRESULTS: The study included 252 aviators, 97.6% males, mean age 34.9-years, following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants manifested mild symptoms (79.4%) or were asymptomatic (20.6%). Post-COVID-19 spirometry results 10.79\u2009\u00b1\u20095.67 days following infection were compared to measurements performed 41.3\u2009\u00b1\u200928.59 months earlier. Pre- and post-COVID-19 results were comparable, with similar minimal abnormalities rates (2% and 4.4%, respectively). In addition, there were no restrictive abnormalities following infection, and just 7.7% of individuals had a marginally low DLCO of 70-80% of predicted.\nCONCLUSION: Among vaccinated, healthy adults, mild COVID-19 had no significant impact on PFT early post-infection. The data suggest that systematic PFT testing might not be necessary for asymptomatic healthy individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19."

Previous studies indicated a mortality rate of 20%-30% among SOT recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the advent of the Omicron variant in November 2021, characterized by milder symptoms and lower mortality rates in the general population, safety measures relaxed, potentially impacting vulnerable populations like SOT recipients.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate mortality and morbidity among hospitalized SOT recipients with COVID-19 infection during the Omicron wave.\nMETHODS: A retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study conducted at the Rabin Medical Center, Israel, spanned from November 2021 to June 2023. Adult SOT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 were compared to matched controls.\nRESULTS: Among 139 hospitalized SOT recipients and 209 controls, SOT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 displayed higher in-hospital mortality (19% vs. 11%) and 90-day all-cause mortality (30% vs. 17%). In addition, the 90-day readmission rate was significantly higher among SOT recipients (43% vs. 31%). Multivariable analysis confirmed these trends, with SOT recipients exhibiting increased risk for mortality, readmission, invasive ventilation, and intensive care unit admission.\nCONCLUSIONS: The heightened vulnerability of hospitalized SOT recipients during the Omicron wave was characterized by higher mortality and readmission rates compared to matched controls. Despite the perceived milder nature of the Omicron variant, SOT recipients remain disproportionately affected. Continued vigilance and targeted interventions are necessary for this population including vaccinations and adherence to preventive measures. Investigating this population's outcomes through the changing COVID-19 variants is still warranted."

            "abstract": "Evidence shows that responses to health crises often worsen existing disparities. As the approval of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine for people 12 years and older became imminent in the spring of 2021, our institution sought to meet the urgent need to vaccinate the young people in our community facing inequities in pandemic response. In this report, we describe our institution's approach to responding to a rapidly emerging public health need and how we continue to leverage this framework to respond equitably to subsequent local health crises. We recognized that groups of children who had been most impacted by the detrimental effects of the pandemic would also face significant barriers to accessing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. To identify this at-risk cohort, we partnered with our public health department and the school district to use data to identify the zone improvement plan (ZIP) codes with the lowest adult SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates, schools most often closed due to COVID-19 outbreaks, and schools with the highest percentage of students undervaccinated against routine childhood diseases. We then partnered with our local school district and community organizations who were similarly committed to serving the children of our community (including museums, faith centers, and the zoo, among others), to develop and promote 50 COVID-19 vaccine clinic locations that were positioned to maximize access for populations of children at greatest need. Through these efforts, we administered 10,792 vaccinations to 6,981 unique patients. Of these, 8,503 were in Philadelphia with over one-third (37 percent) of vaccines given to people from our target ZIP codes, and non-White individuals represented 73 percent of the vaccine recipients. Key lessons included utilizing available data to select where care delivery sites would be positioned, integrating with other responding organizations to coordinate efforts and avoid overlap, providing care to the whole family (not just children) when able, and developing a robust monitoring structure with iterative change to maximize impact for our target populations. Key challenges included navigating the balance between low attendance clinics in high-risk areas or areas that were difficult to access while striving to be resource-efficient and maximize our impact on vulnerable populations. In conclusion, recognition of the potential for disaster response to worsen existing disparities in healthcare should lead managers to include a specific focus on equity in their planning. Our experience demonstrates that coordinated, intentional response can successfully minimize disaster impact on our most vulnerable populations."

Individuals with physician-diagnosed COPD who received a COVID-19 PCR test were included. COVID-19 positive and negative patients were matched on age, sex, vaccination status, PCR test date, and a propensity score. Patients were followed from the end of the acute infection period (12-weeks post-PCR) until the study end date. Per-person-year HCU rates were captured and compared. Analyses were stratified by COVID-19 variant eras (Wild-Type/Alpha/Beta, Delta, and Omicron) and vaccination status (0, 1, 2, and \u22653).\nRESULTS: We identified 31,540 matched pairs. Mean age was 66.4 years and 49.9% were male. Individuals with positive COVID-19 tests had 9% higher HCU rates than those who tested negative (rate ratio [RR]: 1.09 CI: 1.067-1.127). Stratifying by variant, Wild-Type/Alpha/Beta and Omicron variants had 16% (RR: 1.16, CI: 1.119-1.22) and 5% (RR: 1.051, CI: 1.01-1.092) higher HCU rates respectively. Individuals with \u22653 vaccinations did not have elevated rates of HCU (RR: 1.03, CI: 0.981-1.081) compared to those who tested negative.\nINTERPRETATION: COVID-19 positive COPD patients had significantly greater long-term HCU usage. Although Omicron has been considered milder than previous variants, it was still associated with significantly elevated long-term HCU. Individuals with \u22653 vaccinations who tested positive for COVID-19 had similar HCU rates to those who tested negative, suggesting that vaccinations can reduce long-term healthcare utilization."

We developed the Social Vulnerability Index-Plus (SVI+) as a composite measure of 19 census tract-level social and health indicators summarizing community vulnerability. Ecological analyses included linear regression estimates of differences in weekly COVID-19 case and death rates per 100,000 population by SVI\u2009+\u2009across 201 census tracts. Multilevel analyses included log-binomial regression estimates of relative risk of individual-level death among confirmed cases according to the SVI+. Calendar periods included Pre-Vaccine (03/2020-12/15/2020), Post-Vaccine/Pre-Delta variant surge (12/16/20-06/30/21), and Post-Vaccine/Delta variant surge (7/1/21-11/21).\nRESULTS: We observed a positive association between SVI\u2009+\u2009and both COVID-19 census tract-level case and death rates. Analyses by calendar period indicated that the strongest association between SVI\u2009+\u2009and both case rates, and death rates was in the Post-Vaccine/Delta variant surge period. Analyses of individual-level death among cases showed a positive association between SVI\u2009+\u2009and COVID-19 death after accounting for age, race, and sex. SVI\u2009+\u2009and individual-level death were positively associated in all calendar periods.\nCONCLUSION: Even after vaccine availability, communities with higher social vulnerability experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes. The findings reiterate the importance of addressing social determinants by increasing public health efforts in vulnerable communities to mitigate health disparities in future pandemics."

The COVID-19 pandemic developed midway through enrollment, creating an opportunity to assess its impact.\nMETHODS: Twenty-two sites (North America, Australia) prospectively enrolled 205 children (aged 28 days to 18 years) with AIS from December 2016 to January 2022, including 100 cases during the COVID-19 pandemic epoch, defined here as January 2020 to January 2022. To assess background rates of subclinical infection, we enrolled 100 stroke-free well children, including 39 during the pandemic. We measured serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid total antibodies (present after infection, not vaccination; half-life of 3-6 months). We assessed clinical infection via parental interview.\nRESULTS: The monthly rate of eligible AIS cases declined from spring through fall 2020, recovering in early 2021 and peaking in the spring. The prepandemic and pandemic cases were similar except pandemic cases had fewer clinical infections in the prior month (17% versus 30%; P=0.02) and more focal cerebral arteriopathy (20% versus 11%; P=0.09). Among pandemic cases, 26 of 100 (26%) had positive antibodies, versus 4 of 39 (10%) of pandemic-era well children (P=0.04). The first SARS-CoV-2 positive case occurred in July 2020. Ten of the 26 (38%) positive cases had a recent infection by parental report, and 7 of those 10 had received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Only 1 had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Median (interquartile range) nucleocapsid IgG total levels were 50.1 S/CO (specimen to calibrator absorbance ratio; 26.9-95.3) in the positive cases and 18.8 (12.0-101) in the positive well children (P=0.33).\nCONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have had dual effects on childhood AIS: an indirect protective effect related to public health measures reducing infectious exposure in general, and a deleterious effect as COVID-19 emerged as another respiratory virus that can trigger childhood AIS."

            "abstract": "Vaccines against COVID-19 have high efficacy and low rates of adverse events. However, none of the available vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, and reinfections remain possible. This review aims to summarize the immunological responses elicited by different immunization strategies, examining the roles of homologous and heterologous vaccination and hybrid immunity. Homologous vaccination regimens exhibit considerable variation in immune responses depending on the vaccine platform, particularly concerning antibody titers, B cell activation, and T cell responses. mRNA vaccines, such as mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, consistently generate higher and more durable levels of neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells compared to adenovirus-based vaccines like Ad26.COV2.S and ChAdOx1. The combination of two distinct vaccine platforms, each targeting different immune pathways, seems to be more effective in promoting long-lasting B cell responses and potent T cell responses. The high heterogeneity of the available studies, the different dosing schemes, the succession of new variants, and the subjects' immunological background do not allow for a definitive conclusion. Overall, heterologous vaccination strategies, combining sequentially viral vector and mRNA may deliver a more balanced and robust humoral and cellular immune response compared to homologous regimens. Hybrid immunity, which arises from SARS-CoV-2 infection preceded or followed by vaccination produces markedly stronger immune responses than either vaccination or infection alone. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern varies depending on both the vaccine platform and prior infection status. Hybrid immunity leads to a broader antibody repertoire, providing enhanced neutralization of variants of concern. Heterologous vaccination and hybrid immunity may provide further opportunities to enhance immune responses, offering broader protection and greater durability of immunity. However, from all-cause mortality, symptomatic or severe COVID, and serious adverse events at present it is not possible to infer different effects between homologous and heterologous schemes. Next-generation vaccines could involve tweaks to these designs or changes to delivery mechanisms that might improve performance."

We analyzed clinical and demographic data from 1,957 individuals in the state of Georgia, USA, coupled with viral genome sequencing from 1,185 samples. We found no specific mutations associated with disease severity. Compared to those who were unvaccinated, vaccinated individuals experienced less severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, and the effect was similar for both variants. Vaccination within the prior 3-9 months was associated with decreased odds of moderate disease, severe disease, and death. Older age and underlying health conditions, especially immunosuppression and renal disease, were associated with increased disease severity. Overall, this study provides insights into the impact of vaccination status, variants/mutations, and clinical factors on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection when vaccination rates are low. Understanding these associations will help refine and reinforce messaging around the crucial importance of vaccination in mitigating the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease."

Macrolides are the first-choice antibiotics for the treatment of pertussis. Limited data exist on the impact of the early administration of clarithromycin or azithromycin on infants' pertussis symptoms. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed infants enrolled in an enhanced surveillance program for pertussis at a single Italian clinical reference center between 2015 and 2020. All cases were laboratory-confirmed. This study compared outcomes based on the timing of macrolide antibiotic treatment: early administration (within 7 days of cough onset) versus late administration (8 days or later). Key outcomes included cough duration, symptom frequency, and complication rates. Results: We studied 148 infants with confirmed pertussis. The median duration of coughing was 14 days in infants with early administration and 24 days in those with late administration. The occurrence of symptoms differed for apnea (62.6% for early administration; 84.6% for late administration). In a multivariable Cox model, the duration of the cough was lower in infants receiving antibiotics within 7 days from the beginning of the cough compared with those starting later (HR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.25-0.53, p &lt; 0.001). Clarithromycin was associated with a shorter duration of coughing (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.19-0.92, p = 0.030) independently from other factors. Regarding the occurrence of symptoms, children receiving antibiotics later were three times more likely to experience apnea compared to those treated early (p = 0.008). Conclusions: Early treatment with clarithromycin or azithromycin for infants with pertussis improves clinical symptoms. Clarithromycin may be more effective than azithromycin in shortening coughing. The early administration of antibiotics may also help prevent the spread of disease during the resurgence of pertussis and should be considered regardless of the laboratory confirmation, while taking into account the potential side effects of an unnecessary therapy."

However, effective interventions ensuring the appropriate use of antiviral agents by physicians have yet to be fully established. Thus, this study evaluated the impact of an educational film on antiviral prescription rates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: This prospective, nationwide, web-based survey enrolled 1500 physicians. They were instructed to view a short educational film and assess the necessity of prescribing antiviral agents in 16 fictitious scenarios featuring adult patients with COVID-19 with varying risk factors for severe disease and vaccination statuses. We compared the antiviral prescription rates before and after viewing the educational film. Results: There was a significant increase in the antiviral prescription rates after viewing the educational film, particularly nirmatrelvir/ritonavir prescribed in cases involving immunocompromised patients (from 31.3% to 49.4%) and those with obesity (from 15.1% to 33.7%) who were unvaccinated and had no risk of drug interactions. However, viewing the educational film made little to no impact on the prescription rates for the patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia or those with no underlying conditions.

Results generally indicate that the burden of cases disproportionately impacted larger-sized counties, while the burden of deaths disproportionately impacted smaller counties. This may be partially due to multiple interacting social mechanisms, including a higher proportion of older adults who live in smaller counties. Moreover, these likely social mechanisms interacting with vaccinations and virus waves created a dynamic pattern whereby the rate and magnitude of infections and deaths were population- and time-dependent. Our results offer a novel perspective on the scaling dynamics of infectious diseases, highlighting how both the rate and magnitude of COVID-19 cases and deaths scale differently across counties. Population size and age structure are key factors in predicting disease burden. Our findings have practical implications, suggesting that scaling-informed public health policies could more effectively allocate resources and interventions to mitigate the impact of future epidemics across heterogeneous populations."

This study explored the effects of a community-based educational intervention designed to improve influenza vaccine literacy and acceptance among vulnerable REM individuals.\nMETHODS: The intervention included four 45 min interactive educational sessions on the influenza vaccine. The session attendees (18+) were invited to participate in a pre-/post-intervention study where an anonymous survey measured their post-COVID-19 pandemic attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors regarding the influenza virus and vaccine. To assess the effect of the intervention on vaccine literacy, we used a Mann-Whitney U test to test for differences between the pre-/post-intervention survey responses to seven knowledge-based questions. Descriptive statistics were employed to assess the impact of intervention on vaccine acceptance.\nRESULTS: A total of 116 participants completed the pre-intervention survey, and 90 (78%) completed the post-intervention survey. All (100%) identified as REM, and 99% lived in highly vulnerable areas. Only 43% believed they were at risk for viral infection before the intervention, but 60% said the intervention helped them reassess their risk. We found significant differences in vaccine literacy when comparing the pre-/post-intervention survey responses, particularly regarding guideline-based vaccine recommendations (p &lt; 0.05). Before the intervention, 65% of the participants indicated a high likelihood of receiving the influenza vaccine. In contrast, after the intervention, 81% of respondents indicated a high likelihood of being vaccinated, and 72% indicated that they were \"extremely likely\" to receive the immunization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Community-based educational interventions can have a positive impact on influenza vaccine literacy and acceptance among vulnerable REM populations in the post-COVID-19 era."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid development and distribution of vaccines as a critical strategy to control the spread of the virus. This paper explores COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the state of Ohio, with a particular focus on the difference between metro and non-metro residents.\nMETHOD: Survey data collected as part of the IMPACT-Ohio Project were used for this study. From August 2021 to February 2023, 3,806 individuals who resided in 12 Ohio counties (six metro and six non-metro counties) responded to the survey. Chi-square tests compared the relationships between various demographic, socio-economic and clinical characteristics among metro and non-metro region respondents. Binary logistic regression modeled the probability of receipt of COVID-19 vaccine and compared those Ohioans who lived in metro (RUCC codes 1-3) vs non-metro (RUCC codes 4-9) counties with adjustment of various covariates.\nRESULTS: Participants residing in metro counties were almost two times more likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those living in non-metro counties adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and clinical characteristics (aOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.38-2.58, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake was associated with younger age (less than 65\u00a0years old), lower education level, having no health insurance or public insurance and being food insecure.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the barriers and determinants associated with vaccine uptake which can inform future interventions and public health policies aimed at improving vaccination rates in Ohio."

Misclassification of and missing race and ethnicity (race/ethnicity) data hinder efforts to identify and address health disparities in the US Military Health System (MHS); therefore, we evaluated the statistical accuracy of administratively recorded race/ethnicity data in the MHS Data Repository (MDR) through comparison to self-reported race/ethnicity collected via questionnaire in the Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) cohort study.\nMETHODS: The study population included 6009 active duty/retired military (AD/R) and dependent beneficiaries (DB). Considering EPICC study responses the \"gold standard,\" we calculated sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) by race/ethnicity category (non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, Hispanic, NH Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), NH American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN), NH Other, missing/unknown).\nRESULTS: Among AD/R, the highest sensitivity and PPV values were for NH White (0.93, 0.96), NH Black (0.90, 0.92), Hispanic (0.80, 0.93), and NH A/PI (0.84, 0.95) and lowest for NH AI/AN (0.62, 0.57) and NH Other (0.09, 0.03). The MDR was missing race/ethnicity data for approximately 63% of DB and sensitivity values, though not PPV, were comparatively much lower: NH White (0.35, 0.88), NH Black (0.55, 0.89), Hispanic (0.13, 1.00), and NH A/PI (0.28, 0.84).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation of MDR race/ethnicity data revealed misclassification, particularly among some minority groups, and substantial missingness among DB. The potential bias introduced impacts the ability to address health disparities and conduct health research in the MHS, including studies of COVID-19, and needs further examination."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway experienced successive waves of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, each with distinct characteristics, including patient demographics, medical therapies, vaccine coverage, respiratory failure management and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to analyse survival in a national cohort of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian ICUs (March 2020-May 2023) and examine how patient characteristics and management strategies were associated with mortality across successive stages of the pandemic.\nMETHODS: Patients admitted to ICUs between 10 March 2020 and 5 May 2023, were identified via the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry. We included all adults (\u226518\u2009years) and analysed data on demographics, predefined risk factors, severity, patient management and outcomes. We quantified associations between patient demographics, risk factors and admission period with mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS).\nRESULTS: The study included 2655 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients admitted from 2022 onwards were significantly older (median age >70) and had more predefined risk factors compared to those admitted during earlier periods (median age\u2009<\u200965\u2009years). Management of respiratory failure shifted towards less frequent use of invasive mechanical ventilation. The crude 90-day mortality rate doubled from 21% (95% CI 14; 24) in the first half of 2020 to 43.5% (95% CI 31.1; 45.7) in the first half of 2023. ICU LOS decreased substantially from a median of 14.1\u2009days (interquartile range [IQR] 6.8; 23.1) to 2.6\u2009days (IQR 1.1; 5.0). The time period of admission, patient age, pre-defined risk factors and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) were significantly associated with mortality. Prolonged ICU LOS was primarily associated with respiratory support mode, age and higher SAPS II scores.\nCONCLUSION: In this nationwide study of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway, ICU mortality was significantly higher in later compared to earlier admission periods, largely explained by changes in case mix, such as older patients with more co-morbidities. While ICU therapies were modified over the course of the pandemic, their impact on survival cannot be determined from our analyses (NCT04601090).\nEDITORIAL COMMENT: In this article, findings from Norway's national Intensive care database are presented for critically ill SARS-CoV-2 cases, including the different pandemic waves throughout the whole period. Characteristics and trends related to illness and ICU care are presented."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Active Rotavirus diarrhea surveillance has been ongoing in Zambia at three dedicated sentinel sites since 2007, focusing on hospitalized children under five years of age. During 2021 and 2022, many African countries, including Zambia, experienced a severe shortage of rotavirus vaccines. This vaccine shortage resulted in many children who were eligible for vaccination remaining unvaccinated. Consequently, these children were exposed to a higher risk of severe acute gastroenteritis.\nMETHODS: To ascertain the impact of rotavirus vaccine stock-out and switch in Zambia, a comprehensive desk review was conducted focusing on the switch of the vaccine from Rotarix to Rotavac and the change of the Rotavac formulation. This review encompassed all children under five years of age recruited at the surveillance sites between 2017 and 2023 and the country's comparison of national administrative and WUENIC 2023 rotavirus vaccine coverage rate estimates for 2014 to 2023. March 2022 to April 2023 was defined as the Rotarix vaccine stock-out period. Hospitalization trends, demographic and clinical data, and rotavirus confirmed ELISA results were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Following the introduction of rotavirus vaccine, the number of fully vaccinated children increased steadily over the years, reaching 4.73 million in 2023. However, 2.63 million children missed vaccination between 2016 and 2023. The administrative and WUENIC 2023 estimates for rotavirus coverage rates were the same during the period under review. Hospitalized diarrhea cases and rotavirus positivity rates remained essentially the same during the in-stock and stock-out periods of rotavirus vaccine. However, mortality rates increased three-fold during the vaccine stock-out period.\nCONCLUSION: The impact of the Rotarix vaccine era was reversed due to the global supply chain disruptions, leading to missed vaccinations, increased diarrhea-related hospitalizations, and higher infant mortality in Zambia. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have further disrupted the vaccination sessions, further impacting rotavirus vaccination. Rotarix shortages likely contributed to rising rotavirus cases. There is an urgent need to completely replace the old under-5 vaccination card with a revised one to improve documentation for new rotavirus vaccines."

            "abstract": "In this work, we investigate a mathematical model that depicts the dynamics of COVID-19, with an emphasis on the effectiveness of detection and diagnosis procedures as well as the impact of quarantine measures. Using data from May 1 to May 31, 2020, the current study compares three states: Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. A compartmental model has been developed in order to forecast the pandemic's trajectory and devise an effective control strategy. The study then examines the dynamic progression of the pandemic by including important epidemiological factors into a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. Our method is a thorough analysis of the equilibria of the deterministic mathematical model in question. We use rigorous techniques to find these equilibrium points and then conduct a comprehensive investigation of their stability. Furthermore, an optimum control problem is applied to reduce the illness fatality, taking into account both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical intervention options as control functions. With the aid of Pontryagin's maximal principle, an objective functional has been created and solved in order to minimize the number of infected people and lower the cost of the controls. In terms of the basic reproduction number, the stability of biologically plausible equilibrium points and the qualitative behavior of the model are examined. We found that the disease transmission rate has an effect on reducing the spread of diseases after conducting sensitivity analysis with regard to the basic reproduction number. According to the findings, Tamil Nadu had the lowest reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) and Maharashtra the highest ([Formula: see text]), indicating regional differences in the efficacy of public health initiatives. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that appropriate control strategies, such as vaccination (\u039c), can successfully reduce infection levels and improve recovery rates. In our study compared to the other two states, Tamil Nadu is notable for its quick recovery and decrease in infection rates. In our findings are more dependable and applicable when mathematical analysis and numerical simulations are combined, which also helps to provide a more thorough understanding of the dynamics at work in the COVID-19 environment. This research also offers suggestions for how government agencies, health groups, and legislators can lessen the effects of COVID-19 and distribute resources as efficiently as possible . Finally, we conclude by discussing the optimal control strategy to contain the epidemic."

This study aimed to identify the factors influencing parental decisions about COVID-19 vaccination for their children in Kansas, including demographic variables, trust in medical professionals, vaccine safety, and the impact of misinformation.\nMETHODS: Data were analyzed from Phase 3.7, Week 53 of the United States Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (N = 68,504), collected between January 4 and January 16, 2023. The analysis focused on data specific to the state of Kansas (N = 1,231), using standard descriptive statistics to assess the findings.\nRESULTS: The respondents were predominantly middle-aged, female, and Caucasian, with a high level of educational attainment and health insurance coverage. Among respondents, 45.7% (n = 563) had children under 18 living in their household. Of these, 73.5% (n = 414) expressed concerns that led them to refrain from vaccinating their children against COVID-19. The primary reasons for hesitancy included concerns about potential side effects, distrust in the vaccine's safety for children, and the belief that their children were not part of a high-risk group for having severe illness with COVID-19.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore persistent concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy among parents, even within a relatively well-educated and insured population. Addressing these concerns with targeted public health messaging and education could be essential in increasing vaccination rates among children in Kansas."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In response to the rapid global transmission of COVID-19, governments worldwide enacted lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to control the disease. In this study, we aim to quantify the influence of NPIs on the transmission of COVID-19 within selected European regions, specifically Spain (including the Basque Country) and Italy (including Tuscany), during the period of February to December 2020, which predates the initiation of COVID-19 vaccinations. We investigate potential correlations and associations between the implementation of NPIs, changes in COVID-19 transmission rates, and alterations in life expectancy across different age and sex categories from the year 2019 to 2020.\nMETHODS: We use a Susceptible-Hospitalized-Asymptomatic/Mild-Recovered-Deceased (SHARD) ordinary differential equations model to analyze COVID-19 dynamics in the studied regions. The model calibration process was performed with empirical data on hospitalization and death to estimate the weekly transmission and death rates. To quantify reductions in life expectancy, we used established survival analysis techniques.\nRESULTS: The SHARD model effectively captures multiple waves of COVID-19, accurately representing peaks and aligning with the instantaneous reproduction number. Our analysis reveals a 66-78% reduction in transmission rates during the initial set of NPIs in March 2020, followed by a 34-55% reduction during the subsequent NPIs in October 2020. Additionally, the elderly and individuals with comorbidities experienced the most pronounced reductions in life expectancy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our model calibration approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions across multiple waves of an epidemic. By applying this method to COVID-19 dynamics, we have demonstrated the capacity to quantify the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on transmission rates. These findings offer practical insights into the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating COVID-19 spread and contribute to the broader understanding of epidemic control strategies."

Previous studies highlighted decreased mortality rates during the predominance of the omicron variant; however, severely immunocompromised individuals remained at high risk due to limited vaccine response. This study aims to compare mortality rates during the omicron period between immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in The Netherlands.\nMETHODS: Utilizing data from the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) registry, this study analyzed ICU admissions due to COVID-19 from February 2022 to December 2023. Patients were categorized as immunocompromised based on recorded immunologic insufficiencies or associated conditions. A historical cohort of viral pneumonia patients from 2017 to 2019 was used for comparison. Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, gender, body-mass index (BMI), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation IV (APACHE-IV) mortality risk, compared in-hospital and ICU mortality and length of stay between groups. A sensitivity analysis excluded early omicron period admissions to assess the consistency of findings.\nRESULTS: Among 1491 patients admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19, 29.5% were immunocompromised, showing significantly higher in-hospital adjusted odds ratio (OR<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.56, 95% CI 1.20-2.04) and ICU mortality (OR<sub>adj</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.64, 95% CI 1.25-2.17) compared to non-immunocompromised patients. The historical cohort exhibited lower mortality rates for immunocompromised individuals compared to the COVID-19 cohort. Sensitivity analysis confirmed these trends, with slight attenuation of odds ratios.\nCONCLUSION: Immunocompromised patients admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 during the omicron period had higher mortality than non-immunocompromised patients. Additionally, immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 had higher mortality than immunocompromised patients with other viral pneumonias. Our results provide additional evidence that COVID-19 is still a significant health concern to immunocompromised individuals, which warrants specific and effective measures to protect this vulnerable group."

Patients' demographic and clinical details were recorded. Associations between mild/moderate or severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 variants and patient characteristics were assessed by logistic regression. Rates and genomic locations of mutations, as well as quasi-species distribution (\u2265\u20092 heterogeneous positions,\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00d7\u2009coverage) were estimated based on 1,332 high-quality sequences.ResultsOverall, 11 SARS-CoV-2 clades infected 1,762 study patients of median age 59\u2009years (interquartile range (IQR):\u200945-73), with 52.5% (n\u2009=\u2009925) being male. In total, 101 non-synonymous substitutions/insertions correlated with disease prognosis (severe, n\u2009=\u200927; mild-to-moderate, n\u2009=\u200974).

AAA1 showed an inverse association with age but not with any other characteristics. The I+/V- group displayed higher median AAA1 levels and seropositivity (7.9%) compared to the other groups (p \u2264 0.011), translating into a 2-fold increased AAA1 seroconversion risk (Odds ratio [OR]: 2.11, [95% Confidence Interval (CI)]: 1.22-3.65; p=0.008), unchanged after adjustment for age and sex. AAA1 seropositivity was independently associated with a 2-fold odds of symptoms persistence at \u2265 4 weeks (p \u2264 0.03) in the entire dataset and infected individuals, but not \u2265 12 weeks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the study (cross-sectional design, patient-related outcomes using validated questionnaires), the results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection could elicit an AAA1 response in children, which could be independently associated with short-time symptoms persistence."

Maintenance treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) improves progression-free survival (PFS) in follicular lymphoma (FL), but also impairs anti-SARS-CoV2 immune response. This challenge has been addressed in Italy by temporary, definitive or no discontinuation of anti-CD20 treatment. We report the outcome of 539 FL patients receiving anti-CD20 MoAbs (rituximab in 431, obinutuzumab in 108), which were temporarily discontinued in 150 patients (group A), definitively discontinued in 166 (group B), or uninterrupted in 223 (group C).

This study investigates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 via mutation dynamics, focusing on distinct age cohorts, geographical location, and vaccination status within the Indian population, one of the nations most affected by COVID-19.\nMETHODOLOGY: Comprehensive dataset, across diverse time points during the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variant waves, captured essential phases of the pandemic's footprint in India. By leveraging genomic data from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), we examined the substitution mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 in three demographic segments: children (1-17 years), working-age adults (18-64 years), and elderly individuals (65+ years). A balanced dataset of 69,975 samples was used for the study, comprising 23,325 samples from each group. This design ensured high statistical power, as confirmed by power analysis. We employed bioinformatics and statistical analyses, to explore genetic diversity patterns and substitution frequencies across the age groups.\nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The working-age group exhibited a notably high frequency of unique substitutions, suggesting that immune pressures within highly interactive populations may accelerate viral adaptation. Geographic analysis emphasizes notable regional variation in substitution rates, potentially driven by population density and local transmission dynamics, while regions with more homogeneous strain circulation show relatively lower substitution rates. The analysis also revealed a significant surge in unique substitutions across all age groups during the vaccination period, with substitution rates remaining elevated even after widespread vaccination, compared to pre-vaccination levels. This trend supports the\u00a0virus's\u00a0adaptive response to heightened immune pressures from vaccination, as observed through the increased prevalence of substitutions in important regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome like ORF1ab and Spike, potentially contributing to immune escape and\u00a0transmissibility.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings affirm the importance of continuous surveillance on viral evolution, particularly in countries with high transmission rates. This research provides insights for anticipating future viral outbreaks and refining pandemic preparedness strategies, thus enhancing our capacity for proactive global health responses."

Data protection concerns and the lack of data interoperability and standardization hindered the collection, analysis, and interpretation of critical information. Effective data visualization and customization are essential to facilitate decision-making.\nOBJECTIVE: This study describes the development of the PANDEM-2 dashboard, a system providing a standardized and interactive platform for decision-making in pandemic management. It outlines the participatory approaches used to involve expert end users in its development and addresses key considerations of privacy, data protection, and ethical and social issues.\nMETHODS: Development was informed by a review of 25 publicly available COVID-19 dashboards, leading to the creation of a visualization catalog. User requirements were gathered through workshops and consultations with 20 experts from various health care and public health professions in 13 European Union countries. These were further refined by mapping variables and indicators required to fulfill the identified needs. Through a participatory design process, end users interacted with a preprototype platform, explored potential interface designs, and provided feedback to refine the system's components. Potential privacy, data protection, and ethical and social risks associated with the technology, along with mitigation strategies, were identified through an iterative impact assessment.\nRESULTS: Key variables incorporated into the PANDEM-2 dashboard included case rates, number of deaths, mortality rates, hospital resources, hospital admissions, testing, contact tracing, and vaccination uptake. Cases, deaths, and vaccination uptake were prioritized as the most relevant and readily available variables. However, data gaps, particularly in contact tracing and mortality rates, highlighted the need for better data collection and reporting mechanisms. User feedback emphasized the importance of diverse data visualization formats combining different data types, as well as analyzing data across various time frames. Users also expressed interest in generating custom visualizations and reports, especially on the impact of government interventions. Participants noted challenges in data reporting, such as inconsistencies in reporting levels, time intervals, the need for standardization between member states, and General Data Protection Regulation concerns for data sharing. Identified risks included ethical concerns (accessibility, user autonomy, responsible use, transparency, and accountability), privacy and data protection (security and access controls and data reidentification), and social issues (unintentional bias, data quality and accuracy, dependency on technology, and collaborative development). Mitigation measures focused on designing user-friendly interfaces, implementing robust security protocols, and promoting cross-member state collaboration.\nCONCLUSIONS: The PANDEM-2 dashboard provides an adaptable, user-friendly platform for pandemic preparedness and response. Our findings highlight the critical role of data interoperability, cross-border collaboration, and custom IT tools in strengthening future health crisis management. They also offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in developing IT solutions to support pandemic preparedness."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza vaccination is essential for reducing the risk and impact of influenza. Makkah region in Saudi Arabia, a destination for millions of pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah, presents a unique context for this study. Therefore, this research investigates the prevalence and influencing factors of influenza vaccine uptake among the public in Makkah region, Saudi Arabia.\nMETHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia between February and June 2024. The main researcher developed the questionnaire, which was reviewed by five academics and then piloted with 20 individuals for validation. An online questionnaire was used, targeting residents aged 18 and over with internet access. A snowball sampling method was applied. Data were collected via Google Forms and analyzed using SPSS version 26, employing descriptive statistics such as frequencies, percentages, and means.\nRESULTS: The total number of respondents is 450 participants, with a response rate of 4.5%. Most respondents were male (71.1%) and aged between 18 and 30 years (44.5%). Education levels varied, with 57.5% holding a bachelor's degree. Vaccination uptake showed 65.1% had received the vaccine, with 31.1% confident it is safe. Despite this, 58.8% did not get vaccinated this season. Confidence in the vaccine's effectiveness was 59.5%, though 41.2% reported breakthrough infections. Accessibility was generally rated easy (57.7%). Social pressure (17.4%), trust in health institutions (36.9%), and COVID-19 concerns (36.7%) significantly influenced vaccination decisions. The likelihood of vaccination next season displayed polarized views.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides significant insights about vaccine hesitancy that may inform future research endeavors and practical applications. Understanding the various factors that impact the adoption of influenza vaccines offers valuable insights for developing targeted interventions and public health policies to improve vaccination rates. This study enhances theoretical understanding and practical strategies to encourage influenza vaccination, thereby improving public health initiatives in the area and beyond."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coadministration of vaccines in children is a long-standing practice that has proven to be safe and effective in improving the efficiency of vaccine administration, thereby increasing immunization coverage rates. As the number of vaccines routinely recommended for adults increases, and with limited opportunities for adults to have preventive health touchpoints with providers, adult vaccine coadministration should be considered as a routine practice to improve vaccination coverage rates and public health. A review of existing literature was conducted to examine the potential reactogenicity and impact on effectiveness when co-administering vaccines to adults.\nMETHODS: Medline was searched for research articles with the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination,\" combined with the search terms \"simultaneous,\" \"concomitant,\" \"concurrent,\" and \"combination.\" Another search of Medline was conducted on the search term \"influenza vaccine\" or \"vaccination\" combined with the following individual search terms: \"RSV,\" \"COVID,\" and \"Tdap.\" The references of extracted articles were also examined for potential other relevant articles.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Adult vaccine coadministration is safe for all the combinations we assessed. Most adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate and of short duration. Some studies showed slightly more reactogenicity with coadministration but few or no serious AEs or safety signals. Nearly every study confirmed that coadministration had no significant effect on immune response for either vaccine. The benefits of vaccine coadministration outweigh the risks. It increases convenience for vaccinees, reduces the number of missed opportunities to vaccinate, and contributes to efficient use of healthcare resources."

The projected deaths during 2020-2022 were derived from Quasi-Poisson Regression models applied to the 2015-2019 provincial mortality data, adjusting for seasonal trends, population offsets, and overdispersion. The results were aggregated to national and socioeconomic levels for comparative analyses. Excess deaths were calculated as the difference between observed and projected deaths. P-scores and excess mortality per 100,000 inhabitants were utilized as standardized metrics. Socioeconomic disparities were examined using the Socioeconomic Development Ranking of Provinces and Regions (SEGE-2017). We assessed the associations between excess mortality and vaccination coverage, elderly population ratio, intensive care unit beds per 100,000 population, and population per family physician.\nRESULTS: T\u00fcrkiye experienced 247,640 excess deaths [95% confidence interval (CI): 176,405-315,204] from 2020 to 2022. Excess mortality peaked in 2021 with 121,426 excess deaths (27.2% P-score, 143.5 per 100,000 population). Lower vaccination coverage [estimate: -0.51, 95% CI: (-0.81, -0.20), p = 0.001] and higher population per family physician [estimate: 0.01, 95% CI: (0.00, 0.02), p = 0.005] were significantly associated with higher excess mortality. A higher elderly population ratio was positively associated with excess deaths [estimate: 1.41, 95% CI: (0.50, 2.32), p = 0.003]. Socioeconomically less developed regions (SEGE 5 and SEGE 6) exhibited higher P-scores (21.3% and 20.2%, respectively), indicating greater relative increases in mortality when compared with the relatively more developed regions.\nCONCLUSION: Excess mortality in T\u00fcrkiye during the COVID-19 pandemic was substantial, particularly in 2021, and was influenced by regional socioeconomic disparities, vaccination coverage, and healthcare access. These findings underscore the importance of addressing sociodemographic factors and strengthening primary healthcare services in pandemic responses."

We investigated the COVID-19 vaccination coverage among people with disabilities compared to people without disabilities. We identified risk factors of under-vaccination and vulnerable subgroups.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess COVID-19 vaccination coverage in individuals with disabilities compared with individuals without disabilities and identify risk factors for under-vaccination.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency-COVID-19-National Health Insurance Service (K-COV-N) cohort, which registered adults with disabilities in 2020 and age and sex-matched individuals without disabilities were included. Vaccination records from the rollout through March 31, 2022 were analysed. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models were employed.\nRESULTS: This study included 4,811,866 participants after exclusions. Within the same disability type, individuals with severe disabilities had higher non-vaccination rates than those with mild disabilities. Individuals with pulmonary, brain and cardiac disabilities exhibited higher age-standardized non-vaccination rates (16.7\u00a0%, 15.1\u00a0% and 12.5\u00a0%, respectively). individuals with disabilities were more likely to be under-vaccinated than those without disabilities, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.01 (95\u00a0% CI 1.01-1.02). Females consistently exhibited a higher likelihood of non-vaccination in all subgroups. The impact of age differed based on the disability subgroups. The likelihood of under-vaccination was low in employee-insured individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Individuals with disabilities were less likely to receive COVID-19 vaccination compared with those without disabilities and variations were observed by disability types. Tailored strategies considering identified risk factors are required to ensure equal vaccination access for individuals with disabilities in future pandemics."

            "abstract": "Studying the interplay among human mobility, viral transmission, and vaccination can provide significant insights into the factors driving a pandemic. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, this paper investigates how human mobility, population density, and vaccination affect viral transmission. We employ two data-driven approaches: correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). Firstly, the correlation analysis reveals a nonuniform relationship between human mobility and disease incidence during the six pandemic periods. The most significant changes in mobility occurred during the initial emergence phase and after the vaccine rollout. We found a positive correlation between mobility and case rates early in the pandemic, but later on, they were not positively correlated. Consequently, after the widespread availability of the vaccine, mobility returned to around % of pre-pandemic values as the case incidence decreased. Secondly, we employed SEM to investigate two key aspects. Initially, we explored the association between mobility and COVID-19 incidence during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods for Florida and cross-validated with California, Texas, and New York. Subsequently, we analyzed how vaccination directly and indirectly impacted disease transmission after it became widely available. The findings reveal that vaccination led to a significant drop in case numbers and an increase in mobility, which may have contributed to the subsequent epidemic wave."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airborne pathogens present challenges in settings like jails or prisons with a high density of contacts. The state of Georgia has the highest percentage of its citizens under correctional supervision in the United States. Yet, it had slow COVID vaccine uptake among jail residents, requiring prevention also using non-pharmaceutical interventions. Using a network-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model parameterized with data from the Fulton County Jail, this study investigates the impact of three SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies: vaccination, contact tracing and quarantining, and jail release to reduce jail population density.\nMETHODS: Social contact networks were simulated at two different overlapping network layers: cell and block. Cell-level contacts represented shared confined sleeping space, whereas block-level contacts represented shared socialization space. Contact tracing and quarantining were simulated at the cell-level or both cell- and block-levels, hereafter referred to as all-level. A reference scenario and nine intervention scenarios were simulated three hundred times to estimate the median and interquartile range (IQR) of the outcome measures. Each scenario simulated a 185-day period to measure the prolonged effects of the interventions amid a potential COVID outbreak in the jail. The cumulative incidence, number of infections averted (NIA), and percentage of infections averted (PIA) were calculated comparing interventions against a base scenario without them. For the seven scenarios involving contact tracing and quarantining, total quarantines over the simulation and the number of quarantines per day were calculated to determine the quarantine requirements. Sensitivity analyses compared the impact of jointly varying vaccination rates and contact tracing rates.\nRESULTS: Cell-level contact tracing alone was an ineffective intervention (3.2% PIA), but its impact increased in combination with other interventions (i.e., vaccination or increased jail release rate). The other intervention strategies each produced a PIA over 10%, with the jail release scenario producing a PIA of nearly 20% despite only resulting in a 13% reduction in the jail population. The all-level contact tracing only scenario was effective at both 50% and 100% of contacts traced, but feasibility would be limited without a reduction in the jail population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementing a combination intervention approach could substantially reduce the morbidity from COVID-19 and future respiratory viruses in this jail setting while providing secondary protection to the community."

Extensive research has focused on diagnostics, treatments, and vaccine development to combat the virus. Given the need for effective strategies to reduce infection rates, disease progression, and severity, this study aimed to investigate the potential role of vitamin D (25OHD) in mitigating the severity of COVID-19.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D levels were measured using the Roche Diagnostics Vitamin D assay in 100 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients were categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, and the correlation between vitamin D levels and symptom severity was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The findings demonstrated that a significant proportion of symptomatic patients had vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL. In contrast, approximately 25% of asymptomatic patients had vitamin D levels exceeding 30 ng/mL. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant association between low vitamin D levels and increased symptom severity (p=0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation could potentially reduce the risk of severe disease. However, to confirm these findings and support these recommendations, further research, including randomized controlled trials and large-scale population studies, is necessary."

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the effects of mutations on SARS-CoV-2 viral fitness can inform public-health responses such as vaccine development and predicting the impact of a new variant; it can also illuminate biological mechanisms including those underlying the emergence of variants of concern. Recently, Lan et al. reported a model of SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure and its underlying dimethyl sulfate reactivity data (Lan et al., 2022). I investigated whether base reactivities and secondary structure models derived from them can explain some variability in the frequency of observing different nucleotide substitutions across millions of patient sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. Nucleotide basepairing was compared to the estimated 'mutational fitness' of substitutions, a measurement of the difference between a substitution's observed and expected frequency that is correlated with other estimates of viral fitness (Bloom and Neher, 2023). This comparison revealed that secondary structure is often predictive of substitution frequency, with significant decreases in substitution frequencies at basepaired positions. Focusing on the mutational fitness of C\u2192U, the most common type of substitution, I describe C\u2192U substitutions at basepaired positions that characterize major SARS-CoV-2 variants; such mutations may have a greater impact on fitness than appreciated when considering substitution frequency alone."

The capacity of vaccination ecosystems to effectively respond and adapt to shocks demonstrates programme resilience. This study sought to describe components that contribute to resilience in national immunisation programmes.\nMETHODS: Mixed-methods study comprising in-depth interviews and surveys with n=30 vaccination programme experts in eight countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, Greece, Japan, Nigeria, Philippines, Spain and the USA). We elicited data on country-specific shocks, associated effects and factors that facilitated or impeded programme resilience. Interviews and open-ended survey responses were analysed qualitatively, with closed-ended survey questions analysed using descriptive statistics.\nRESULTS: Experts described immediate effects of shocks including decreased vaccine uptake and negative perceptions of vaccination from the public and media. Late emerging impacts included increased vaccine hesitancy and vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) rates. Stakeholder education, immunisation information systems (IIS) and programme financing were key factors to strengthening programme resilience. Appropriately trained frontline healthcare personnel can counter vaccine misinformation that otherwise erodes trust and contributes to hesitancy. The COVID-19 pandemic also exposed structural weaknesses in programme resilience, with experts highlighting the need for robust IIS and workforce support to mitigate burnout and strengthen resilience when a shock occurs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide preliminary insights into factors that experts believe to be associated with vaccination programme resilience. Anticipating, adapting and responding to shocks is central to strengthening systems, ensuring ecosystem resilience and protecting against current and future VPD threats."

We explore how the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination was associated with this decline.\nMETHODS: Using an interrupted time series design, we evaluate the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the start of COVID-19 vaccination on seasonally adjusted monthly total fertility rates in 22 high-income countries. We study the associations between COVID-19 vaccination and fertility by additionally controlling for youth unemployment, stringency index and vaccination coverage. Fertility data come from the Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations data series under the Human Fertility Database. Indicators used as control variables originate from Eurostat and OECD databases, Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and Our World in Data.\nRESULTS: The start of the pandemic had an immediate effect on fertility in most countries, although the size and direction of level changes considerably varied across them. The impact of COVID-19 vaccination was likewise extensive. While a relatively pronounced negative association between the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and fertility 9\u2009months later was found only for 10 out of 22 countries, indications of a negative fertility response were detected in the vast majority of countries. For several countries, the decline was preceded by fertility increase that took place after the onset of the pandemic. Only 4 out of 22 countries had post-vaccination fertility declines that resulted in fertility being on lower level than what the pre-pandemic trend predicted. Additional control variables changed the associations only a little.\nCONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccination campaign contributed to the variation in short-term fertility trends. Several countries experienced declines following the campaign, which often returned fertility closer to the pre-pandemic trend. Fertility appears to have responded in short run to vaccination, but only in few cases such that the long-term trajectory is below the pre-pandemic trend."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis can be a life-threatening condition, characterized by necrotizing inflammation of small blood vessels. Major organ involvement, most commonly kidney and lung disease, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Intensive early immunosuppressive therapy is the cornerstone of management and has transformed ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) into a chronic relapsing condition. Remission induction with tapering glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab is the standard of care for severe disease. Avacopan, an oral C5aR1 antagonist, has been approved for remission induction and helps minimize glucocorticoid exposure. Plasma exchange should be considered for severe kidney or life-threatening disease. Lower dose glucocorticoid induction regimens can be used without compromising remission rates. Remission maintenance therapy is recommended, and rituximab is usually first line over azathioprine. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or methotrexate with low-dose glucocorticoids are third-line options. Immunosuppression-associated infection risk remains a concern, both during acute presentations and in the long term, highlighted by the impact of rituximab on humoral immunity and vaccine response during the COVID-19 pandemic. There remains an ongoing need for therapies that induce rapid remission and optimize kidney recovery while minimizing infection risk. Clinical trials are evaluating newer therapeutic options. Due to increasing treatment options, management should be individualized, balancing effective immunosuppression against comorbidities and frailty.\nSUMMARY: This review focuses on the treatment decision pathways for clinicians and patients in the management of severe AAV (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis). Key clinical trials, predictors of outcome, novel therapeutics, and practical steps to mitigate infection risk are discussed.\nKEY MESSAGES: Immunosuppression regimens have been refined due to emerging evidence from clinical trials. Rituximab, avacopan, and reduced-dose glucocorticoid schedules have been the focus of recent studies. Infections and immunosuppression-induced immunodeficiency must be considered when determining individualized treatment."

Our study aims to quantify the impact of vaccination programmes during the initial year of vaccination (2021) by estimating the number of case fatalities avoided, using Sweden as a case study.\nMETHODS: Using Swedish data on age-specific reported incidence and vaccination uptake, along with vaccine efficacies, age-specific contact patterns and under-reporting from the literature, we fit a Bayesian SEIR epidemic model with time-varying community contact rate for COVID-19 incidence. Age-specific fatality rates from the literature are adjusted proportionally to fit the observed number of case fatalities in the factual analysis, resulting in 5,510 (95% PI: 5,370-5,650) matching the observed number 5,430. The estimated time-varying community contact rate is then used in a counterfactual analysis where the population is unvaccinated, leading to more infections and fatalities. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify which parameters influence our conclusions.\nFINDINGS: The counterfactual analysis result in a severe epidemic outbreak during the early autumn of 2021, resulting in about 37,100 (36,700-37,500) number of case fatalities. Consequently, the number of lives saved by the vaccination programme is estimated to be about 31,600 (31,300-32,000), out of which 5,170 are directly saved and 26,400 are indirectly saved, mainly by drastically reducing the severe outbreak in the early autumn of 2021, which would have occurred without vaccination and unchanged community contact rate.\nINTERPRETATION: Our mathematical model is used to analyse the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on lives saved in Sweden during 2021, but the same methodology can be applied to other countries. The counterfactual analysis offers insights into an alternative trajectory of the pandemic without vaccination. The results show the direct impact of vaccination on reducing deaths for infected individuals and shed light on the indirect effects of reduced transmission dynamics."

We applied a mixed-effects, negative binomial, interrupted time series model to estimate the impact that each policy of interest had on reported cases. Results. Mandatory stay-at-home periods were associated with a decrease in reported chlamydia (incident rate ratio [IRR]\u2009=\u20090.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.71, 0.80) and gonorrhea (IRR\u2009=\u20090.85; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.78, 0.94) cases. We also observed decreased chlamydia case reporting when gatherings were restricted to 10 people (IRR\u2009=\u20090.88; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85, 0.92), masking was recommended (IRR\u2009=\u20090.90; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.85, 0.97), or polymerase chain reaction testing was limited to symptomatic individuals (IRR\u2009=\u20090.72; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.67, 0.77). Universal vaccine access corresponded to decreases in reported gonorrhea (IRR\u2009=\u20090.83; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.75, 0.92) but increases in syphilis (IRR\u2009=\u20091.33; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04, 1.70) cases. We also observed effects by sex, race, and ethnicity. Conclusions. COVID-19 policies had disparate effects on sexually transmitted infection rates that varied across demographic groups. Overall results were attenuated after the first lockdown period (March-May 2020), but demographic variations persisted.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to analyze in-hospital mortality (IHM) among all COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Spain between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, and to compare two distinct periods: the prevaccination period (March 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021) and the vaccination period (February 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021). The objective was to assess the impact of vaccination on IHM and identify associated risk factors, using data from Spain's national hospitalization registry.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis used data from the Spanish National Surveillance System for Hospital Data. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (IHM). Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors across the overall study period, as well as during the prevaccination and vaccination periods. Risk factors included age (in 20-year intervals), sex, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, and others), and admission to the intensive care unit.\nRESULTS: A total of 524,314 COVID-19 hospitalizations were recorded in Spain, with 329,690 during the prevaccination period and 194,624 during the vaccination period. Hospitalization rates dropped from 697/100,000 people to 411/100,000, and in-hospital mortality (IHM) decreased from 16.2 to 11.5% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.70-0.73, p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001). IHM rose with age, from 0.8% in patients aged 18-39 to 31.7% in those \u226580\u202fyears (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001), but significant decreases were observed across all age groups after vaccination, especially in those \u226580\u202fyears (AOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.75-0.79, p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001). Risk factors for IHM remained consistent, with leukemia, neoplasm, and lymphoma posing the highest risks, while female sex (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.74-0.77, p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) and dyslipidemia (AOR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.32-0.86, p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001) were protective factors.\nCONCLUSION: During the vaccination period, the risk of in-hospital mortality (IHM) was 29% lower than in the prevaccination period, after adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities. This reduced risk was observed across sexes, age groups, and comorbidities. The risk factors for IHM remained consistent between the two periods, with age as the main risk factor, while female sex and dyslipidemia were identified as protective factors."

Questionnaires were administered between November 2021 and March 2022 in three immunization centers in Italy. More than half of HCWs (56.8%) reported to always recommend COVID-19 vaccination to their patients, and the recommendations for other vaccinations were provided by 50.4% of the participants. Physicians/medical residents, males, and those who recommended other vaccinations to their patients were more likely to always recommend COVID-19 vaccination. The participants' perception of difficulties in communicating with patients about COVID-19 vaccination and the impact of sources of information on patients' knowledge about vaccination, explored using a ten-point Likert-type scale, resulted in a mean value of 6.3 and 7.9, respectively. A higher level of perception regarding difficulties in communicating with patients was more likely to be found among nurses/midwives and younger HCWs. It is important to reduce HCWs' perceived gap regarding difficulties in communicating with patients, supporting them through health policy to recommend vaccinations, and engaging them in increasing uptake rates."

Response frequencies described the proportion of each sample that would prefer a flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine to standalone influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. A multivariate logit regression model explored how certain characteristics influenced the odds of selecting the flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine over a standalone influenza vaccine.\nRESULTS: Most consumers (398/601; 66.2%) and HCPs (250/298; 83.9%) preferred a flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine to a standalone influenza vaccine. When not forced to choose between flu\u2009+\u2009COVID and standalone influenza vaccines, most consumers again selected the flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine (62.3%); 14.7% would prefer separate standalone influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, 8.3% a standalone influenza vaccine only, 7.3% a COVID-19 vaccine only, and 7.4% neither vaccine. Consumers aged \u226550\u2009years with a body mass index \u226540, those aged \u226565\u2009years who previously received a COVID-19 vaccine, and those who had previously experienced severe impacts from influenza were more likely to choose a flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine over a standalone influenza vaccine than were consumers without these characteristics. HCPs whose practice stocks high-dose influenza vaccines were more likely to choose the flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine for patients aged \u226565 with no risk factors and patients aged 18-64 with \u22651 risk factor over the standalone influenza vaccine.\nLIMITATIONS: Results are subject to potential hypothetical, responder, selection, and information biases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most US consumers and HCPs would likely prefer a single-shot combination flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine compared with standalone influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Given the low COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates in the US, the availability of a combination flu\u2009+\u2009COVID vaccine could help increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage."

However, the heterogeneous diagnostic criteria for postvaccination inflammatory heart diseases may result in overestimating incidence rates. The aim of this multicentre Italian registry is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in the Italian population.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to Italian hospitals for endomyocardial and/or cardiac magnetic resonance proven acute myocarditis and/or pericarditis in the same period (1 June-31 October) of 2019 and 2021 were enrolled, irrespective of the potential association with the COVID-19 vaccines. Acute pericarditis and/or myocarditis were defined as 'vaccine-related' if clinical presentation occurred within 15\u200adays after COVID-19 vaccination, independently of the dose.\nRESULTS: There was a comparable incidence rate ratio (IRR) for inflammatory heart diseases in 2019 and 2021 (2019: IRR 0.67 versus 2021: IRR 0.74, P\u200a=\u200a0.45). In particular, the IRR did not differ in myocardial involvement (2019: IRR 0.33 versus 2021: IRR 0.33, P\u200a=\u200a1) and pericarditis (2019: IRR 0.37 versus 2021: IRR 0.49, P\u200a=\u200a0.09) in both periods. Among 125 cases registered in 2021, 32 (25.6%) were 'vaccine-related'. Among those who experienced 'vaccine-related' myocarditis and/or pericarditis, men with age under 40\u200ayears were over-represented (53.12%, P\u200a=\u200a0.021).\nCONCLUSION: In a nationwide Italian survey comparing pandemic with prepandemic periods, the overall data do not indicate significant concerns about an increased incidence of pericarditis and myocarditis, suggesting that the vaccine is generally well tolerated for these specific conditions."

Therefore, this study aimed to determine awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention among Iranian farmers.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a valid questionnaire with 336 farmers randomly selected from villages in Kurdistan Province, Iran. To be eligible for the study, participants had to be 18 years of age or older and currently working on a farm in the study region.\nRESULTS: The mean age years of participants was 49.31\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD\u2009=\u200912.23. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of attitude and performance scores were 11.50\u2009\u00b1\u20093.78 (min\u2009=\u20092, max\u2009=\u200920) and 9.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.48 (min\u2009=\u20090, max\u2009=\u200915), respectively. The findings indicate that while 90.2% of participants are aware of the risks of prolonged sun exposure, misconceptions remain. Only 46.4% recognize UV dangers on cloudy days, and 63.4% understand sunscreen use is needed beyond sunny conditions. Awareness of specific risks like skin cancer (42.6%) and sunburn (27.4%) is moderate, while knowledge of cataracts (6.8%) and premature skin aging (9.2%) is low. Barriers to sunscreen use persist, with only 22.3% deeming it important and 40.8% finding it convenient. The risk of developing skin cancer was underestimated in 131 (39.0%) participants.\nCONCLUSION: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding skin cancer prevention among farmers in Iran are low. There is a need for culturally appropriate educational messages and intervention programs to increase awareness, improve attitudes, and promote preventive behaviors among farmers."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, originating from basal cells in the skin's outer layer. It frequently arises from prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Although BCC rarely metastasizes, it can cause significant local tissue damage if left untreated. Early detection is essential to prevent extensive damage and potential disfigurement. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently remains uncertain about the benefits and potential harms of routine skin cancer screenings in asymptomatic individuals. This paper evaluates the accuracy of predicting BCC using patients' medical histories to address this uncertainty and support early detection efforts.\nMETHODS: We analyzed the medical histories of 405,608 patients, including 7733 with BCC. We categorized 25,154 diagnoses into 16 body systems based on the hierarchy in the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology. For each body system, we identified the most severe condition present. Logistic Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was then employed to predict BCC, using demographic information, body systems, and pairwise and triple combinations of body systems, as well as missing value indicators. The dataset was split into 90% for training and 10% for validation. Model performance was evaluated using McFadden's R 2 , Percentage Deviance Explained (PDE), and cross-validated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nRESULTS: Diagnoses related to the Integument system showed an 8-fold higher likelihood of being associated with BCC compared to diagnoses related to other systems. Older (age from 60 to 69) white individuals were more likely to receive a BCC diagnosis. After training the model, it achieved a McFadden's R 2 of 0.286, an AUC of 0.912, and a PDE of 28.390%, reflecting a high level of explained variance and prediction accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential of LASSO Regression models to enhance early identification of BCC. Extant medical history of patients, available in electronic health records, can accurately predict the risk of BCC. Integrating such predictive models into clinical practice could significantly improve early detection and intervention."

Prolonged ultraviolet (UV) exposure, aging, male gender, and immunosuppression represent most of the causes of this category of diseases. BCCs and cSCCs both include different types of skin cancers, such as nodular or morpheaform BCC or flat cSCC. Locally advanced and metastatic NMSCs cannot be treated surgically; thus, systemic therapy (TKI and Immunotherapy) is needed. Interestingly, NMSCs are frequently linked to abnormal Hedgehog (HH) signaling which most systemic immunotherapies for these cancers are based upon. Of note, the first line therapies of BCC, sonidegib and vismodegib, are HH inhibitors. Programmed death receptor 1 antibody (PD-1) inhibitors such as cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab have been approved for the treatment of cSCC. Thus, this paper reviews the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and treatment options for both BCC and cSCC."

Regular self-examinations of the skin can significantly enhance treatment outcomes. This report investigates a rare instance of BCC initially misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis, stemming from a longstanding wound on the patient's left shoulder. A 66-year-old male with a history of working in construction presented with a non-healing wound on his left shoulder, which he initially sustained from a metallic rod injury. Despite self-treatment, the wound deteriorated, revealing subcutaneous fat and producing foul-smelling drainage. Imaging suggested osteomyelitis, but the persistent and worsening nature of the wound over two years, previously concealed from his family and healthcare providers, prompted further investigation. A biopsy confirmed infiltrative BCC. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for comprehensive treatment, including long-term antibiotics for osteomyelitis and systemic therapy with vismodegib for BCC. Basal cell carcinoma commonly appears as a pink or flesh-colored papule or nodule, often with surface features that aid in early identification and treatment. Yet, infiltrative BCC, like the case described here, can pose diagnostic challenges because of its subtle yet aggressive characteristics. The complex causes of BCC highlight the necessity of preventive actions, particularly for those with prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Treatment approaches primarily aim at removing the tumor and may incorporate targeted therapies for more advanced instances. This case underscores the importance of regular skin self-examinations and prompt medical attention for lingering wounds, particularly among those at higher risk. Successfully addressing BCC demands a comprehensive strategy involving surgery, targeted chemotherapy, and preventive actions against potential future skin malignancies. Maintaining long-term surveillance is crucial for individuals with prior BCC diagnoses to detect any potential recurrence and address any enduring consequences of treatment."

            "abstract": "Gel manicures have become part of a popular personal care service in the last two decades due to increased longevity of the polish and the added strength to the nail plate. Prolonged exposure to nail ultraviolet (UV) lamps is required to cure the gel polish. Despite the increased use of UV nail lamps, there is limited consensus in the literature on the risk of skin malignancy associated with UV nail lamps. The objective of this article was to provide a systematic review of the risk of skin malignancy associated with the use of UV nail lamps and to synthesize evidence-based recommendations on their safe usage. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the databases, Medline and Embase, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 2,331 non-duplicate articles. Nine were ultimately included, of which three were case reports, one was a cross-sectional study, and five were experimental studies. The risk of bias per the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was high or unclear, likely due to the number of case reports included. Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV nail lamps may pose a low risk of skin cancer. It is important to note that the available evidence is weak, and patients should be informed about the limited data to make their own decisions. Dermatologists and other healthcare providers should be updated with the latest evidence to address patients' concerns about gel manicures and suggest practices which can effectively reduce the risk of cutaneous malignancy associated with gel manicures, such as the use of UV-blocking gloves or properly applied sunscreens."

During the healing process, it can cause peeling, irritation, and some long-term effects, including premature aging, pigmentation, and a high risk of skin cancer. Rutin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially reduce inflammation and soothe sunburned skin. The objective of the current proposal is to develop and create carbopol gel-encased glycerosomes for the treatment of sunburn. The Design of Expert (DoE) technique was used to optimize the proposed formulation and was subjected to various characterization parameters such as nanovesicles size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, entrapment efficiency (EE), and surface morphology. The optimized rutin-loaded glycerosomes (opt-RUT-loaded-GMs) were further characterised for drug release, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The formulation showed sustained release, greater permeation into the skin, and good antioxidant activity. The dermatokinetic study of opt-RUT-loaded-GMs confirms that the Rutin hydrate had better retention in the epidermis as compared to the dermis, owing to its potential for long lasting protection after topical application. It was observed that the prepared formulation was stable, highly safe, and had good sun protection factor (SPF) values that could be used as a suitable option for topical drug administration to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of the drugs."

Public health measures have been vital in tackling the increased incidence and prevalence of melanoma. The management of melanoma has been revolutionised with the approval of new immunotherapy treatments (anti PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 antibodies) and targeted therapies (BRAF and MEK inhibitors). With some of these therapies becoming the standard of care in the management of advanced disease, it is likely we will see their use increase in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Recently, literature has demonstrated the benefits patients could derive from the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) due to the promising results on its efficacy when compared to monotherapy. However, greater clarity on its use is needed in more unique presentations such as BRAF-wild type melanoma, where the lack of driver mutations makes disease management more challenging. Surgical resection remains an integral part of the management of earlier stages of the disease with a consequent decrease in reliance on other forms of therapy such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Finally, we evaluated the novel emerging experimental approaches to treatment such as adoptive T cell therapy, novel oncolytic treatments and cancer vaccines. We discussed how their use could improve patients' prognosis, enhance treatment efficacy, and potentially achieve cure."

            "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, and, in some individuals, pulmonary fibrosis, granulomatous colitis, and/or immunodeficiency. Ocular findings include nystagmus, reduced iris pigment, reduced retinal pigment, foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the range of 20/50 to 20/400), and strabismus in many individuals. Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually at least a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in variable degrees of bruising, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and/or other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, colitis, and/or neutropenia have been reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in some HPS-related genes. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early 30s and can progress to death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected individuals. Neutropenia and/or immune defects occur primarily in individuals with pathogenic variants in AP3B1 and AP3D1.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The clinical diagnosis of HPS can be established in a proband with hypopigmentation of the skin and hair, characteristic eye findings, and demonstration of absence of platelet delta granules (dense bodies) on electron microscopy. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in AP3B1, AP3D1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S5, BLOC1S6, DTNBP1, HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, or HPS6 confirms the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Correction of refractive errors and use of low vision aids; preferential seating in school; low-vision consultant as needed; UV-blocking sunglasses; surgery for strabismus as needed; protection from sun exposure with protective clothing and sunscreen; standard treatment for skin cancer; thrombin-soaked Gelfoam\u00ae for skin wounds with prolonged bleeding; medical alert bracelet and bleeding management plan; humidifier to reduce frequency of epistaxis; oral contraceptives and IUD for menorrhagia; DDAVP\u00ae (desmopressin acetate) for wisdom tooth extraction and invasive procedures; platelet or red blood cell transfusions for surgery or protracted bleeding; HLA-matched single-donor platelets as needed; maximize pulmonary function with prompt treatment of asthma and pulmonary infections; influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 vaccines; regular moderate exercise; supplemental oxygen for advanced-stage pulmonary fibrosis; lung transplantation for end-stage pulmonary disease; steroids, other anti-inflammatory agents, and/or Remicade\u00ae for granulomatous colitis. Immunodeficiency, when present, is lifelong and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor responsive, and affected individuals benefit from an infection prevention plan. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination including assessment for refractive errors; annual skin examination for evidence of sun-induced skin damage (e.g., solar keratoses [premalignant lesions], basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma); annual pulmonary function testing in those older than age 20 years; colonoscopy in those with symptoms of colitis (e.g., cramping, mucoid stools, hematochezia, melena); assessment for clinical and laboratory manifestations of immunodeficiency. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory products, aspirin-containing products, and other anticoagulants unless medically indicated; activities that increase the risk of bleeding; all tobacco and vaping products and inhalation of chemical and physical substances injurious to the lungs; unprotected and direct sun exposure. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In families with HPS3-, HPS5-, or HPS6-related HPS (milder types of HPS in which hypopigmentation and nystagmus may not be clinically evident), it is appropriate to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: HPS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an HPS-causing pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the HPS-causing pathogenic variants are identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

            "abstract": "Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, with an increasing worldwide incidence in recent decades. The main risk factor for increasing the skin cancer incidence is ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Of the two major forms of skin cancer (melanomas and non-melanotic cancers), the cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most aggressive form, causing about 80% of the deaths resulted from this type of tumor. Malignant melanoma develops through malignant transformation of melanocytes in the skin because of prolonged exposure to solar or artificial UV. The malignant transformation of the melanocytes in the skin is accompanied by the presence of a local inflammatory reaction that, in the initial stages of carcinogenesis, would oppose to tumor development. Chronic exposure to UV or other etiopathogenic factors induces chronic inflammation, which, by producing inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines, prostaglandins), constitutes a tumoral microenvironment that favors carcinogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis, and the presence of neoplastic \"mutant cells\" that avoid the protective action of the immune system. Using immunohistochemistry techniques, we assessed the intra- and peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate cells in CM. The chronic inflammatory infiltrate presented more intense in the peritumoral stroma compared to the intratumoral one, heterogenous, more intensely composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells (MCs), the most numerous cells in the inflammatory infiltrate being T-lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages; B-lymphocytes and MCs were in a small number, especially intratumorally. Inflammatory cells had a direct contact with tumor cells, blood vessels, connective matrix, suggesting that the inflammatory microenvironment plays an important role in carcinogenesis, tumor invasion, local angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis."

            "title": "Association between Ultraviolet B Exposure Levels and Depression in Taiwanese Adults: A Nested Case-Control Study.",
            "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people worldwide. Anxiety, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, myocardial infarction, and cancer, among other disorders, are known to increase the risk of depression. Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) can cause human serotonin levels to increase. The vitamin D pathway is one mechanism through which ultraviolet light absorbed through the skin can affect mood; however, UVB exposure is known to increase the risk of cancer. In this study, we explored the effects of prolonged exposure to UVB on depression. Data were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for 2008 to 2013. Each patient with depression was matched 1:4 with a comparison patient by sex and age (\u00b15 years); thus, the study included 23,579 patients with depression and 94,316 healthy controls for comparison. The patients had been exposed to UVB for at least 1 year to observe the cumulative effect of UVB exposure. Based on the World Health Organization UV index, we divided the observation period data into five UV levels: low, moderate, high, very high, and extreme. A multivariate Poisson regression model was used to assess the risk of depression according to UVB exposure level, adjusting for sex, age, income, urbanization level, month, and comorbidities. The results revealed that the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with depression was 0.889 for moderate levels (95% CI 0.835-0.947), 1.134 for high levels (95% CI: 1.022-1.260), 1.711 for very high levels (95% CI: 1.505-1.945), and 2.785 for extreme levels (95% CI: 2.439-3.180) when compared to low levels. Moderate levels of UVB lowered the risk of depression, while high levels of UVB gradually increased the risk. We propose that UVB at normal concentrations can effectively improve depression. However, exposure to high concentrations of UVB damage DNA results in physical diseases such as skin cancer, which increase the risk of depression."

Patients with Ph-MPN are at an increased risk of Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). The cause of this finding remains uncertain. In this systematic review, we would like to know if chronic use of HU in this population is responsible for the sudden onset of NMSC. The results obtained will help the patients and clinicians with early diagnosis of cutaneous lesions and in optimizing the current treatment options for MPN. We conducted a multi-database literature search, applied eligibility criteria and quality assessment tools to the studies extracted, with an intention to include only fair to high-quality articles. We analyzed six observational studies and four traditional reviews. Two out of 10 studies concluded that no relationship exists between the incidence of NMSC and HU. The remaining eight studies indicated the association. According to these studies, the possible risk factors include old age, excessive exposure to sunlight, higher doses, and prolonged HU therapy duration. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and HU play a combined role in carcinogenesis. Periodic dermatologic screening is essential in these patients. Prompt biopsy and accurate diagnosis can prevent the progression of cancer and decrease the associated morbidity and mortality. True incidence and causation cannot be ascertained due to the scarcity of research on this topic. Multi-center prospective studies in large groups of Ph-MPN patients are recommended to determine the temporal relationship between NMSC and HU treatment."

            "abstract": "Despite growing public awareness of the adverse consequences of excessive sun exposure, modifying sun-seeking behavior is challenging because it appears to be driven by addictive mechanisms. This can have effects on health because sun exposure, although beneficial, when prolonged and repeated shows a causal relationship with skin cancer risk. Using data from 2,500 United Kingdom twins, we observed sun seeking to be significantly heritable (h2 \u2265 58%). In a GWAS meta-analysis of sun-seeking behavior in 261,915 subjects of European ancestry, we identified five GWAS-significant loci previously associated with addiction, behavioral and personality traits, cognitive function, and educational attainment and enriched for CNS gene expression: MIR2113 (P\u00a0= 2.08\u00a0\u00d7 10-11), FAM76B/MTMR2/CEP57 (P\u00a0= 3.70\u00a0\u00d7 10-9), CADM2 (P\u00a0= 9.36\u00a0\u00d7 10-9), TMEM182 (P\u00a0=\u00a01.64\u00a0\u00d7 10-8), and PLCL1/LINC01923/SATB2 (P\u00a0= 3.93\u00a0\u00d7 10-8). These findings imply that the behavior concerning UV exposure is complicated by a genetic predisposition shared with neuropsychological traits. This should be taken into consideration when designing awareness campaigns and may help improve people's attitudes toward sun exposure."

            "title": "Systemic availability of lipophilic organic UV filters through dermal sunscreen exposure.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chemical UV filters are common components in sunscreens and cosmetic products and used to protect the skin against harmful effects of sunlight like sunburn. However, the effectiveness of sunscreens in the prevention of skin cancer is in some parts still controversial. Meanwhile, questions about negative effects of the chemical UV filters on human health arise and request an effective risk assessment. Real-life exposure data in humans after application of these products are still rare. Thus, we explored whether and to what extent UV filters are absorbed through the skin into the human body.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Plasma and urine samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected before, during and after a real-life exposure scenario (1st application: 2\u202fmg/cm2; 2nd and 3rd (after 2 and 4\u202fh): 1\u202fmg/cm2 each) using a commercial sunscreen formulation for one day. These samples were analyzed for their content of the currently prominent UV filters octocrylene and avobenzone as well as 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylic acid (CDAA) as the main octocrylene metabolite by using different liquid chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometric procedures.\nRESULTS: Following dermal sunscreen exposure, avobenzone, octocrylene and CDAA reached concentrations up to 11\u202f\u03bcg/L, 25\u202f\u03bcg/L and 1352\u202f\u03bcg/L in plasma. In urine detection rates of avobenzone and octocrylene were low while CDAA showed a high detection rate and reached up to 5207\u202f\u03bcg/g creatinine. Kinetic models could be fitted for octocrylene and CDAA in plasma and CDAA in urine. Concentration peaks were reached between 10 and 16\u202fh after first application and half-life periods were in the range of 1.5 to 2\u202fdays. The lipophilic UV filter octocrylene and its metabolite CDAA showed a much slower elimination than other more hydrophilic UV filters. Concordantly, the metabolite CDAA in particular showed a markedly increased renal excretion over the whole sampling period and indicated high internal exposure to OC.\nDISCUSSION: Real-life sunscreen usage leads to considerable bioavailability of organic UV filters and their metabolites which is rarely seen for other environmental exposures. A combined monitoring of the parent compound and its metabolites is important to fully address internal exposure to the UV filter in humans. Considering the kinetic profiles a prolonged systemic release due to depot formation in skin and a potential accumulation through multi-day exposure is presumed. High in-vivo loads call for a critical toxicological assessment of the UV filters and their metabolites."

            "abstract": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main modifiable risk factor for skin cancer. The Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) was introduced as a tool to visualize the intensity of UV radiation on a certain day, which should enable and encourage people to take appropriate protective measures. The 'low' exposure category of the UVI, defined by a rounded UVI value of 0, 1 or 2, was linked to the health message 'No protection required' by the World Health Organization and partner organizations. However, published evidence corroborating this advice is not available. To evaluate the erythemal risk of low UVI days, we analyzed 14,431 daily time series of ambient erythemal irradiance data measured at nine stations of the German solar UV monitoring network during the years 2007-2016. We analyzed the proportion of days in the sample for which ambient erythemal doses calculated for various time intervals exceed average minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of the Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I-VI to assess the potential for erythema arising from sun exposure on days with low UVI values. Additionally, we calculated for each day the minimum exposure duration needed to receive one MED. Our results indicate that on days with a UVI value of 0, risk of erythema is indeed negligible. Conversely, the abovementioned health message appears misleading when melano-compromised individuals (skin type I and II) spend more than 1.5 hours outdoors on days with a UVI value of 2. Under rare circumstances of prolonged exposure, MEDs of the two most sensitive skin types can also be exceeded even on days with a UVI value of 1. Hence, current WHO guidance for sun protection on days with low UVI values needs reconsideration."

            "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes photoaging of the skin and induces a number of disorders, including sunburn, fine and coarse wrinkles, and skin cancer risk. Therefore, the application of sunscreen has gained much attention to reduce the harmful effects of UV irradiation on our skin. Recently, there has been a growing demand for the replacement of chemical sunscreens with natural UV-absorbing compounds. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), promising alternative natural UV-absorbing compounds, are a group of widely distributed, low molecular-weight, water-soluble molecules that can absorb UV radiation and disperse the absorbed energy as heat, without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). More than 30 MAAs have been characterized, from a variety of organisms. In addition to their UV-absorbing properties, there is substantial evidence that MAAs have the potential to protect against skin aging, including antioxidative activity, anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of protein-glycation, and inhibition of collagenase activity. This review will provide an overview of MAAs, as potential anti-aging ingredients, beginning with their structure, before moving on to discuss the most recent experimental observations, including the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which MAAs might protect the skin. In particular, we focus on the potential anti-aging activity of mycosporine-2-glycine (M2G)."

Dietary carotenoids distributed to skin are hypothesized to protect skin against UV-induced damage, although other phytochemicals may play a role. We hypothesize that tomato consumption would protect against skin cancer. SKH-1 hairless and immunocompetent mice (n\u2009=\u2009180) were fed AIN-93G or AIN-93G\u2009+\u200910% tangerine or red tomato powder for 35 weeks. From weeks 11-20, mice (n\u2009=\u2009120) were exposed to 2240\u2009J/m2 UV-B light, 3x/week, and tumors were tracked weekly. Control mice were fed the same diets but not exposed to UV. Tumor number was significantly lower in male mice consuming red tomato diets (1.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50, P\u2009=\u20090.015) or pooled tomato diets (2.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45, P\u2009=\u20090.017) compared to controls (4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65). Carotenoid levels in plasma and skin were quantitated, with total lycopene higher in skin of tangerine fed animals despite a lower dose. Metabolomic analyses elucidated compounds derived from tomato glycoalkaloids (including tomatidine and hydroxylated-tomatidine) as significantly different metabolites in skin after tomato exposure. Here, we describe that tomato consumption can modulate risk for keratinocyte carcinomas; however, the role of the newly identified specific phytochemicals possibly responsible for this action require further investigation."

We divided the patient population in which the occupation was accurately identified in two study groups: occupations with UV exposure (OW), and non-UV exposed occupations (IW) and we compared the clinical and histologic features of the lesions in the two groups.\nRESULTS: The most affected area in both groups was the facial \"mask area\". The cheek was second most affected area in exposed group whereas the scalp area was the second most affected in the non-exposed group. The nodular pattern is the most numerous in both groups (30 lesions in OW group and 15 lesions in the IW group with a mean number of lesions of 1.57\u00b10.90 and 1.27\u00b10.46, respectively) with the mixed type being the second most frequent type for both groups. However, for the OW group the mixed type with an aggressive component was the second most frequent one, while in the non-exposed group, the mixed type with non-aggressive components was the second most frequent, the difference being statistically significant. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict the presence of histopathologically aggressive lesions using gender, age, exposure and anatomical site out of which UV exposure and 3 main anatomical sites (mask zone, cheek and torso) were selected in the final analysis. The probability of the model chi-square (9.430), p\u00a0=\u00a0.05, supports a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.\nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in Romania patients diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, occupationally exposed to UV radiation, develop more frequently lesions on the \"mask area\" of the face; furthermore, prediction of the histo-pathologically aggressive lesions may be supported by the presence of occupational UV exposure and anatomical site (mask zone, cheek and torso) involved.Also, these patients may be at a higher risk to develop more aggressive histologic subtype BCCs. Although limited by a number of factors, especially the small number of subjects, these data suggest the necessity of conducting both retrospective and prospective studies on clinical and histological types of BCCs evolving in patients working outdoor along with identifying additional risk factors."

There is a growing interest in the prevention of skin cancer and antiaging treatment because of aging of the population. Currently, ablative fractional photothermolysis (FP) laser treatment is actively being performed for facial rejuvenation.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to prove the suppressive effect of CO2 fractional laser (FL) on skin cancer development.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of hairless mice were treated with either CO2 FL or nothing at 3-week intervals during the 20 weeks of UV exposure period. The number of tumors was subsequently counted every 2 weeks over the 30-week period to the termination of the experiment. At 30 weeks, representative tumors were evaluated for tumor type. The authors also determined the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and Type 1 procollagen.\nRESULTS: At 30 weeks, the UV- and FL-treated group showed a significantly lower tumor occurrence rate and a more benign progression of tumors than the UV-only treated group. The UV- and FL-treated group presented a higher mRNA level of Type 1 procollagen and a lower level of MMP-13 than the UV-only treated group.\nCONCLUSION: The occurrence of UV-induced skin tumors can be decreased by multiple sessions of ablative FP with CO2 laser."

This UVA-mediated bystander stress is observed between all three cutaneous cell types (i.e., keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts). Significantly, melanocytes appear to be more resistant to direct UVA effects compared with keratinocytes and fibroblasts, although melanocytes are also more susceptible to bystander oxidative signaling. The extensive intercellular flux of oxidative species has not been previously appreciated and could possibly contribute to the observed cancer risk associated with prolonged UVA exposure."

Furthermore, studies have not investigated whether sun exposure at different periods in the lifetime of a person results in differences in risk associations, and little is known about differences according to histological subtype.\nMETHODS: Using a population-based case-control study of 1,334 non-Hispanic white women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer in western Washington State between 2002 and 2009 and 1,679 non-Hispanic white controls, we assessed the relation of epithelial ovarian cancer with constitutional pigmentation characteristics, sun exposure behaviors, and an index of ultraviolet (UV) exposure based on residential history. Information was collected through in-person interviews. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and trend p values (P(trend)).\nRESULTS: We noted no association with residence-based measures of UV exposure or self-reported sun exposure, either over the lifetime or within specific age intervals. Also, we observed little evidence of association between constitutional pigmentation characteristics and risk, save for a suggestion of increased risk among women who reported increased ability to suntan upon prolonged sun exposure (P(trend) = 0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that sun exposure has little influence on the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Additional studies in populations with a wider gradient of sun exposure may yet be warranted."

Demographic, clinical and behavioural data were collected and compared to those collected 23 years ago in the same hospitals (group 1: n=2410).\nRESULTS: Phototypes in both groups were similar. In group 2, the distribution of naevi tended to be spread over the whole body and the severity of sunburn had decreased. Group 2 participants reported a reduction in active sun exposure, especially in the past 10 years, with less leisure-time tanning. There was a significant increase in holidays in sunny locations, although vacation time was shorter, with prolonged daily and annual exposure. Sunscreens were more frequently used and there was an increase in sun-bed use, especially in beauty parlours.\nCONCLUSION: Our study comprises a double snapshot of a population of hospital workers at an interval of 23 years. The information and screening campaigns do not seem to have had the desired effect on the hospital staff surveyed.

The mechanism(s) by which voriconazole may predispose to skin cancer is not clear. Moreover, the relative contribution of voriconazole and other factors such as immunosuppression, ultraviolet exposure, advanced age and skin type is unknown.

It is therefore likely that an additional environmental factor exists as familial and genetic factors play a role in less than 5%. A large amount of (largely forgotten) epidemiologic data indicates that heavy metal exposure is strongly associated with the development of CM. Also, epidemiologic studies of patients with joint replacement indicate a marked subsequent time-related increase in melanoma in patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasties. In these patients chromium and cobalt levels rise to 10x normal and stay elevated at levels two- to threefold normal for at least 10 years. Chromium is widely used in industry for its anticorrosive and steel-strengthening properties and is widespread in everyday materials. Our hypothesis is therefore that chromium, alone or in conjunction with UV, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CM. We have incubated human neonatal melanocytes for more than 10 weeks in the presence of a wide range and concentrations of metals without effect except by hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)and to a lesser degree Co\u00b2(+). After prolonged culture, chromium-incubated cells produced foci and when replated secondary colonies formed. We have just begun to study this phenomenon in more detail and studies without and with different wavelengths of UV will be explored. Of interest is that aneuploidy (a universal chromosomal change in cutaneous melanoma) in lymphocytes in patients with hip-on-hip metal prostheses has been demonstrated by others."

To preserve the activity of the graft, immunosuppressive treatment is required for life in most cases, leading to prolonged immunodeficiency. These patients exhibit an increased risk of cancer, notably of tumors associated with viruses such as carcinomas, Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas. THE DIFFERENT CANCERS CONCERNED: Cutaneous cancers, notably squamous cell carcinomas, are the predominant cancers encountered in transplant recipients and affect around half of the patients within 20 years following the transplant. Squamous cell carcinomas tend to be multiple, may be life-threatening, and appear to predict the onset of other cancers. Exposure to UV, immunosuppression, the relatively old age at the time of the transplant, light skinned phototype, genetic factors and papillomavirus infections are all factors of risk. Other photo-induced tumors, such as melanoma, some sarcomas or Merkel cell carcinomas also appear increased and of severe prognosis. MEASURES OF PREVENTION: The prevalence of these tumors could be reduced by educating the patients on strict sun-protection measures following the transplant. The factors enhancing Kaposi's sarcoma associated with the HHV8 virus remain to be defined. The possibility of transmission of the infection through the graft must lead to the systematic search for this virus in the donors."

Significant treatment-related mortality occurred in both male and female opossums exposed to UV radiation. Photoreactivation reduced the relative risk of skin tumors but not eye tumors in Monodelphis exposed to UV radiation. Eye and skin tumors were less likely to be a cause of death in UV-radiation-exposed opossums subsequently exposed to PRL than in opossums exposed to UV radiation alone. Females exposed only to UV radiation had an increased risk of skin tumor development relative to males."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to UV radiation plays a significant role in the development of melanoma skin cancers. As early surgical removal of the melanoma is the only effective therapy, current strategies for reducing mortality from melanoma focus on prevention of the disease. Chemical sunscreens protect mice from development of skin cancers that resemble sunlight-induced human squamous cell cancers, but there appears to be a complex relationship between UV radiation exposure and development of melanoma.\nPURPOSE: We asked whether common sunscreens would protect mice against UV radiation-induced enhancement of melanoma incidence.\nMETHODS: C3H mice were exposed to 4.8 kJ/m2 UVB from FS40 sunlamps twice a week for 3 weeks. Sunscreens containing 7.5% 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate, 8% octyl-N-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoate, 6% benzophenone-3, or the oil-in-water vehicle alone were applied to the ears and tails of the mice 20 minutes before irradiation. At various times during and after exposure, we determined UV radiation-induced inflammation by measuring ear swelling. We also examined the ears histologically for UV radiation-induced alterations. One day after the final irradiation, 2.5 x 10(4) syngeneic K1735 melanoma cells were injected into the external ears. Mice were examined weekly for tumor growth for 5-8 weeks after tumor cell injection. Control mice were treated in the identical way except for exposure to UV radiation.\nRESULTS: The incidence of melanomas was significantly higher in the UV-irradiated mice. All three sunscreens protected against UV radiation-induced ear swelling and clearly diminished histopathologic alterations, including sunburn cell formation, epidermal hyperplasia, and mononuclear cell infiltrate in the dermis. However, the sunscreens failed to protect against UV radiation-induced increase in melanoma incidence. The sunscreens or vehicle alone did not significantly alter tumor growth.\nCONCLUSIONS: Protection against sunburn does not necessarily imply protection against other possible UV radiation effects, such as enhanced melanoma growth.\nIMPLICATIONS: Sunscreen protection against UV radiation-induced inflammation may encourage prolonged exposure to UV radiation and thus may actually increase the risk of melanoma development. These findings suggest that further research on the ability of sunscreens to prevent melanoma is urgently needed."

            "abstract": "Incidence of melanoma is certainly rising all over the world and this observation has been related to a more frequent and prolonged exposure to the rays of the sun. The authors critically review pertinent literature and conclude that descriptive epidemiology of melanoma does not give survival trends and does not support the claim that melanoma is ultraviolet (UV) dependent. Analytical epidemiology has not reached a consensus on this aspect. Experimental data available are also difficult to interpret because there are consistent differences of susceptibility to UV among different animals, among lamps used and methods of measuring employed in various laboratories. Information available shows that the maximal relative biological activity of UV in humans is at about 305 nm. This evaluation greatly depends on (1) thickness of the skin, (2) the quantity and quality of secretions that cover the skin, (3) cleanness of the skin, (4) the latitude, (5) the weather, (6) the hour of the day and (7) the presence of chemical carcinogens in the air and on the skin. The authors stress the importance of the criteria of clinical diagnosis recently introduced in clinical practice and higher public awareness as the causes of the increasing incidence of melanoma."

Given reports of similar transmission mechanisms for COVID-19 and seasonal coronaviruses, we investigated whether hand hygiene impacted the risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infections. Methods: Data were drawn from three successive winter cohorts (2006-2009) of the England-wide Flu Watch study. \u00a0Participants ( n=1633) provided baseline estimates of hand hygiene behaviour. Coronavirus infections were identified from nasal swabs using RT-PCR. Poisson mixed models estimated the effect of hand hygiene on personal risk of coronavirus illness, both unadjusted and adjusted for confounding by age and healthcare worker status. Results: Moderate-frequency handwashing (6-10 times per day) predicted a lower personal risk of coronavirus infection (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) =0.64, p=0.04). There was no evidence for a dose-response effect of handwashing, with results for higher levels of hand hygiene (&gt;10 times per day) not significant (aIRR =0.83, p=0.42). Conclusions: This is the first empirical evidence that regular handwashing can reduce personal risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infection. These findings support clear public health messaging around the protective effects of hand washing in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic."

This study evaluates the generalizability of V-1P enrollment criteria to the US population and their clinical comorbidity and CV risk factor burden.\nMETHODS: Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2015-March 2020) were used to determine nationally representative estimates. Inclusion criteria were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 70-189 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of \u226520% or 7.5%-19.9% with two CV risk enhancers. The pooled cohort equations (PCE) was used to stratify ASCVD risk in primary analysis. Estimates of the US population were compared with the V-1P eligible population.\nRESULTS: The V-1P eligible population included 23,837,940 adults. Compared with US adults ages 40-79 years, V-1P eligible adults had higher mean 10-year ASCVD risk by PCE (21.1% [95% CI: 20.1%-22.2%] vs 10.0% [95% CI: 9.4%-10.6%]). The V-1P eligible population also had higher rates of hypertension (85.4% [95% CI: 81.6%-89.1%] vs 59.4% [95% CI: 56.7%-62.2%], diabetes (35.6% [95% CI: 31.3%-40.0%] vs 18.7% [95% CI: 16.9%- 20.5%]) and metabolic syndrome (81.6% [95% CI: 78.4%-84.7%] vs 51.1% [48.3%- 53.9%]).

This study aimed to evaluate and compare standard and advanced lipid parameters and inflammatory biomarkers in CHD cases and matched control subjects. We hypothesized that incorporating advanced lipid and inflammatory biomarkers into risk models would improve CHD risk prediction beyond the standard lipid measures.\nMETHODS: CHD cases (n = 227, mean age 61 years, 47% female) and matched controls (n = 526) underwent fasting blood collection while off lipid-lowering medications. Automated chemistry analyses were performed to measure total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C), small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), apolipoproteins (apos) A-I and B, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), serum amyloid-A (SAA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and apoA-I in HDL particles (via 2-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting). Univariate, multivariate, and machine learning analyses compared the CHD cases with the controls.\nRESULTS: The most significant percent differences between male and female cases versus controls were for hsCRP (+78%, +200%), MPO (+109%, +106%), SAA (+84%, +33%), sdLDL-C (+48%; +43%), Lp(a) (+43%,+70%), apoA-I in very large \u03b1-1 HDL (-34%, -26%), HDL-C (-24%, -27%), and apoA-I in very small pre\u03b2-1 HDL (+17%; +16%). Total C, non-HDL-C, and direct and calculated LDL-C levels were only modestly higher in the cases. Multivariate models incorporating advanced parameters were statistically superior to a standard model (C statistic: men: 0.913 vs. 0.856; women: 0.903 versus 0.838). Machine learning identified apoA-I in pre\u03b2-1-HDL, \u03b1-2-HDL, \u03b1-1-HDL, \u03b1-3-HDL, MPO, and sdLDL-C as the top predictors of CHD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a novel approach to CHD risk assessment by integrating advanced HDL particle analysis and machine learning. By assessing HDL subpopulations (\u03b1-1, \u03b1-2, pre\u03b2-1 HDL), inflammatory biomarkers (MPO, SAA), and small dense LDL, we provide a more refined stratification model. Notably, pre\u03b2-1 HDL, an independent risk factor reflecting impaired cholesterol efflux from the artery wall, is highlighted as a critical marker of CHD risk. Our approach allows for earlier identification of high-risk individuals, particularly those with subtle lipid or inflammatory abnormalities, supporting more personalized interventions. These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced lipid profiling and machine learning to enhance CHD risk prediction."

VHR was defined as multiple major ASCVD events or one major event with multiple high-risk conditions. The primary outcome was a composite of 3-year CV events, including cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization.\nRESULTS: 14,475 (54.1 %) patients were classified as VHR, with higher 3-year event rates than non-VHR (9.6 % vs. 7.3 %). Hemoglobin (Hb), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were significant CV risk influencers in VHR patients (hazard ratios [95 % CI]: 0.93 [0.90-0.96], 1.13 [1.06-1.21], 1.07 [1.04-1.11], 0.73 [0.61-0.89], respectively), but not in non-VHR patients.

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, increasing the capacity of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol to mediate macrophage reverse cholesterol transport has been a target of interest in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, clinical studies reporting the limited efficacy of HDL or its main apolipoprotein, APOA1, in reducing cardiovascular events have emerged. Although HDL cholesterol is unlikely to play a direct causal role in CVD, its inverse, albeit modest, association with CVD risk, consistently observed in large population studies, suggests it may influence alternative pathways beyond cholesterol metabolism. Given the diverse functions of HDL and its components, it is conceivable that its impact on CVD occurs through less direct mechanisms. A potential hypothesis is that HDL modulates platelet function, a crucial player in the initiation and progression of atherothrombosis, which may contribute to its observed relationship with CVD risk. In this review, we focus on how HDL and its components, with an emphasis on APOA1, interact with platelets (and their precursors or activation products) to modulate atherothrombotic responses."

This retrospective study included 115 patients treated with CAR-T therapy at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from 2017 to October 2023. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and the presence of obesity-related comorbidities. Clinical outcomes, including Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) severity, treatment efficacy, Overall Survival (OS), and Progression-Free Survival (PFS), were analyzed. Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between covariates and clinical outcomes. The median BMI was 21.91 (IQR 19.265-24.365). Among the patients, 32 were overweight, and only one had a BMI over 30. Severe CRS occurred in 16 patients, with a higher proportion in those with obesity or related conditions (10.4% vs. 3.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.01).

The cross-sectional analysis included 7,744 samples, with 2,398 in the sarcopenia group and 5,346 in the non-sarcopenia group. In the retrospective cohort study, 1,441 participants without sarcopenia at baseline were selected and followed for the development of sarcopenia. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to analyze the association between AIP, BMI, and sarcopenia risk. A restricted cubic spline regression model was used to evaluate the dose-response association, and ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive ability of individual and combined indicators (AIP and BMI). Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the association between AIP, BMI, and sarcopenia risk across different demographic groups.\nRESULTS: The cross-sectional analysis demonstrated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with various factors, including age, marital status, education level, residence, smoking, BMI, uric acid (UA), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), AIP, as well as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart disease (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, revealed that the low AIP group was significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia (OR\u2009=\u20091.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.44, p\u2009=\u20090.02), while no significant difference was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.01, p\u2009=\u20090.07). In the retrospective cohort study, the low AIP group showed a positive association with sarcopenia risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.79, 95% CI 1.18-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.01), and a similar trend was observed in the high AIP group (OR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% CI 1.03-2.77, p\u2009=\u20090.04). BMI was inversely associated with sarcopenia incidence, consistent with the cross-sectional findings. Both AIP and BMI showed a nonlinear dose-response relationship with sarcopenia risk, with AIP approximating a U-shaped curve and BMI approximating an L-shaped curve. Subgroup analysis indicated that, in the 65-69 age group, low AIP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia. In participants aged 70 and above, as well as in females, both low and high AIP levels were significantly associated with higher incidence risk. ROC curve analysis showed that the combined use of AIP and BMI for predicting sarcopenia had an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8913, which was moderately better than the use of AIP (0.6499) or BMI (0.8888) alone.\nCONCLUSION: The changes in AIP and BMI are associated with the risk of sarcopenia, and both provide some predictive value for sarcopenia. Taken together, the combined prediction using AIP and BMI appears to be somewhat more effective than using either indicator alone in assessing the risk of sarcopenia."

Data collected included age, sex, race, education, marital status, poverty-to-income ratio, alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the relationship between ALI and all-cause mortality, with follow-up through 31 December 2019, from the National Center for Health Statistics.\nRESULTS: The study found that ALI in patients was significantly negatively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality in U.S. adults with MASLD/MetALD & Mixed Etiology Steatosis. Participants with higher ALI levels had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with lower ALI levels. After full adjustment, moderate ALI levels were associated with a 42% reduced risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.81), and high ALI levels were associated with a 49% reduced risk (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73) of all-cause mortality.

The Quartile 4 group had the highest MACE risk incidence compared to other groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). K-M analysis confirmed that the Quartile 4 group was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of MACE, HF rehospitalization, and CV death (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). RCS analysis revealed a positive nonlinear relationship between the TG/HDL-C ratio and MACE risk (P for nonlinear\u2009=\u20090.026), with a sharp risk increase above a ratio of 1.08. After adjustment, TG/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with MACE (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.29-1.60). Compared to Quartile 1, adjusted HRs were significantly higher in Quartiles 2, 3, and 4 (all P\u2009<\u20090.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TG/HDL-C ratio is independently associated with 12-month MACE risk in new-onset HF patients. It may serve as a simple, cost-effective marker to improve early risk stratification and guide closer monitoring and tailored management in this high-risk population."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL-3) inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase, increasing both serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels. SHR-1918 is a fully human monoclonal antibody against ANGPTL-3.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of SHR-1918 in patients at moderate or higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with suboptimally controlled hyperlipidemia.\nMETHODS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the effects of SHR-1918 in hypercholesterolemic patients, who did not achieve optimal LDL-C after 4 to 8\u00a0weeks of standard lipid-lowering therapies. A total of 333 patients were enrolled sequentially into 1 of 8 dose cohorts at a 4:1 (active/placebo) ratio. Patients received subcutaneous SHR-1918 at doses of 150, 300, or 600\u00a0mg every 4\u00a0weeks (Q4W), or SHR-1918 at a dose of 600\u00a0mg every 8\u00a0weeks (Q8W), alternating with placebo for a total treatment period of 16\u00a0weeks. The extension treatment included subcutaneous SHR-1918 at a dose of 150, 300, or 600\u00a0mg Q4W over 36\u00a0weeks, or SHR-1918 a dose of 600\u00a0mg Q8W over 40\u00a0weeks and then followed for safety. Prespecified endpoints included percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG. Safety was assessed with laboratory test results and by the incidence and severity of adverse events.\nRESULTS: SHR-1918 demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship with respect to percentage LDL-C lowering for both Q4W and Q8W administration: 21.7%, 27.3%, and 29.9% with 150, 300, and 600\u00a0mg Q4W compared with placebo, respectively, and 22.5% with 600\u00a0mg Q8W compared with placebo. SHR-1918 also substantially reduced TG, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A1, with a better achievement of LDL-C targets. SHR-1918 was generally well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on standard lipid-lowering therapy, ANGPTL-3 inhibition with SHR-1918 further reduces LDL-C by 21.7% to 29.9% in patients at moderate or higher risk of ASCVD. These additional reductions are both dose and dosing frequency dependent. (Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of SHR-1918 in Patients With Hyperlipidemic; NCT06109831)."

The main source of energy in such diets is fat but the composition of nutrients varies This study aims to investigate dietary variations in a real-world LCHF population and its associations with cardiovascular risk factors.\nMETHODS: We recruited 100 volunteers who considered themselves adherent to a LCHF diet. Their last 14 days of dietary intake was assessed using diet history interviews. Validation of energy intake against expenditure was made using activity monitors. Predictive variables for the linear regression models were selected using stepwise bidirectional assessment of Akaike information criterion (AIC).\nRESULTS: Energy intake (E%) from carbohydrates was low, 8.7\u00a0E%, and fat was the main replacement. Dietary cholesterol was associated with higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Dietary sodium intake was associated with higher blood pressure. Protein intake was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure but also with lower HDL. The intake of dietary fibre was associated with lower LDL and total cholesterol but with higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The intake of carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids (SFA) was not associated with any of the outcome variables.\nCONCLUSION: In this LCHF population, variations in intake of carbohydrates and saturated fatty acids could not predict any aspects of the cardiovascular risk profile. Lower fibre intake and higher cholesterol and sodium intake predicted a less favorable cardiovascular risk profile."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies of lipid species have identified several loci shared with various diseases, however, the relationship between lipid species and disease risk remains poorly understood. Here we investigated whether the plasma levels of lipid species are causally linked to disease risk.\nMETHODS: We built genetic predictors of 179 lipid species, measured in 7174 Finnish individuals, by utilising either 11\u00a0high-impact genomic loci or genome-wide polygenic scores (PGS). We assessed the impact of the lipid species on seven diseases by performing disease association across FinnGen (n\u00a0=\u00a0500,348), UK Biobank (n\u00a0=\u00a0420,531), and Generation Scotland (n\u00a0=\u00a020,032). We performed univariable Mendelian randomisation (MR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses to examine whether lipid species impact disease risk independently of standard lipids.\nFINDINGS: PGS explained >4% of the variance for 34 lipid species but variants outside the high-impact loci had only a marginal contribution. Variants within the high-impact loci showed association with all seven diseases. MVMR supported a causal role of ApoB in ischaemic heart disease after accounting for lipid species. Phosphatidylethanolamine-increasing LIPC variants seemed to lower age-related macular degeneration risk independently of HDL-cholesterol. MVMR suggested a protective effect of four lipid species containing arachidonic acid on cholelithiasis risk independently of Total Cholesterol.\nINTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates how genetic predictors of lipid species can be utilised to gain insights into disease risk. We report potential links between lipid species and age-related macular degeneration and cholelithiasis risk, which can be explored for their utility in disease risk prediction and therapy.\nFUNDING: The funders had no role in the study design, data analyses, interpretation, or writing of this article."

Other disorders related to MetS could help assess the comprehensive risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to update the prevalence rates of MetS and to assess its relationship with other disorders and clinical conditions other than the criteria defining MetS. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with a random population-based sample of 6588 study subjects between 18 and 102 years of age. Crude and sex- and age-adjusted prevalence rates of MetS were calculated, and their associations with comorbidities and clinical conditions other than their defining criteria were assessed by bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The adjusted prevalence rates were 36.0% for MetS (39.8% in men; 33.5% in women), 21.5% for premorbid Mets, and 14.5% for morbid MetS. Considering only clinical conditions other than the criteria defining MetS, the independent disorders associated with premorbid MetS were hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, high levels of lipid accumulation product, high triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), high visceral adiposity index, high fatty liver index, and high waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), highlighting excess adiposity (EA). The independent disorders associated with morbid MetS were hypercholesterolaemia, high-WtHR, EA, high-TyG index, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, CKD, and albuminuria, highlighting hypertension. Conclusions: One-fifth of the adult population has premorbid MetS, and almost one-sixth has morbid MetS. Almost two-fifths of people with MetS are at moderate, high, or very high risk of CKD, and four-fifths are at high or very high cardiovascular risk. In addition to the criteria defining MetS, other cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disorders show an independent association with MetS, highlighting EA for premorbid MetS and hypertension for morbid MetS."

All available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, and we considered the scientific novelty of the study, the reliability of the reported study results; the high methodological level of the study of non-statin therapy in patients with dyslipidemia and high residual platelet reactivity, with no language or date restrictions. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for LDL-\u0421, HRRP on their effects on LDL-\u0421 levels and outcomes, taking into account the reliability of the reported study results and the high methodological level of the study. The challenge of achieving target LDL-\u0421 levels, their impact on high residual platelet reactivity, and the choice of optimal antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy remains unresolved.\nRESULTS: The integration of newer therapies, such as inclisiran and PCSK9 inhibitors, may play a critical role in achieving optimal outcomes for patients at high cardiovascular risk.\nCONCLUSION: The necessity of applying an individual multidisciplinary approach in order to determine the best regimen of antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary heart disease, including after revascularization, is shown. This approach will reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Few studies on the relationship between LDL-\u0421 and HRPR dictate the need for more detailed research in this area."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, significantly contributing to increased healthcare costs and deteriorated health. In Malaysia, CVDs account for 20.79% of deaths in government hospitals. Key risk factors include high blood sugar levels, elevated blood pressure, and increased cholesterol levels. Atherosclerosis frequently serves as the underlying condition for coronary heart disease (CHD), with CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 playing a crucial role in recruiting immune cells to inflammation sites. Early diagnosis of CVDs risk is important for preventing severe complications. This crosssectional study aims to investigate the relationship between biomarker CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression levels and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) categories in a Malaysian cohort.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 333 patients from the Family Medicine Specialist Clinic at Hospital Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah were recruited between March 2022 and February 2023. Blood samples were taken after a 12-hour fasting period, and levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were measured. 150 plasma samples were randomly selected for cytokine analysis of CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 using the Human Magnetic Luminex Assay. Patients' cardiovascular risk was assessed using the FRS calculator. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the relationship between cytokine levels and FRS categories, followed by a post hoc test with Bonferroni correction. A logistic regression model was implemented to assess the independent effects of these variables.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrated a significant association between the level of chemokines CCL2 and proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1, and FRS categories (low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk). CCL2 levels were notably higher in the high-risk group, as were TNF-\u03b1 levels, with both biomarkers showing increasing trends with higher risk categories, (p<0.001, effect size=0.32) and (p<0.001, effect size-0.29), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that dyslipidaemia, FBS, and TNF-\u03b1 remained significant after adjusting for other variables. Specifically, dyslipidaemia had lower odds of being in the high-risk group (AOR: 0.04), while FBS (AOR: 3.19) and TNF-\u03b1 (AOR: 1.18).\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of CCL2 and TNF-\u03b1 as biomarkers for CVDs risk assessment. Integrating these biomarkers into CVDs risk prediction models may enhance the precision of identifying individuals at elevated risk. However, the study's cross-sectional design and small sample size for cytokine analysis constrain the findings. Future research should explore the long-term predictive value of these cytokines in larger, longitudinal cohorts and explore more advanced techniques for improving CHD risk prediction models."

This study aimed to identify distinct clusters of individuals with type 2 diabetes who have varying risks of MACE using a data-driven clustering approach.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 49,506 individuals within a multicenter, population-based primary care registry in Catalonia, Spain. Individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 35 or older were recruited between January 2010 and December 2021 and followed for at least 10\u00a0years. Biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk-including serum glucose, HbA1c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, serum ferritin, leukocyte, and monocyte counts-were examined. Clustering analysis was applied to identify patient subgroups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations with cerebrovascular events, coronary events, and composite MACE.\nRESULTS: Five distinct clusters were identified, characterized by differences in serum glucose, HbA1c, lipid profiles, blood pressure, and serum ferritin levels. Individuals with discordantly high serum ferritin levels relative to their body mass index (BMI) exhibited a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In men, hazard ratios (HR) were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.87) for cerebrovascular events, 0.65 (95% CI 0.49-0.88) for coronary events, and 0.68 (95% CI 0.56-0.83) for MACE. In women, HRs were 0.81 (95% CI 0.67-0.92) for cerebrovascular events, 0.73 (95% CI 0.57-0.95) for coronary events, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.92) for MACE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes who exhibit higher-than-expected serum ferritin levels relative to their BMI may have a lower risk of cardiovascular events. These findings suggest that ferritin may play a more complex role in cardiovascular risk than previously assumed and highlight the potential for refined risk stratification strategies in type 2 diabetes management."

During follow-up, a greater decrease in LDL-C was shown in patients with FH (FH:\u2009-\u200931%, 95% CI\u2009-\u200944.6% to -14.6%; P\u2009<\u20090.001) than patients without FH (2%, 95% CI:\u2009-\u200912.1% to 17.4%); however, only 3.6% of them achieved the recommended LDL-C targets based on ASCVD risk assessment. The risks of stroke and CVD were not significantly different between patients with and without FH after 4\u00a0years of follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a marked gap between the high prevalence and low treatment rates of FH in rural populations with hypertension.

Patients with severe conditions may die from myocardial infarction, heart failure or malignant arrhythmia. Intestinal flora plays an important role in various metabolic processes, such as atherosclerosis, tumour formation, and inflammation. However, its direct role in promoting plaque vulnerability must be further explored and validated. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between changes in intestinal flora, its metabolites in CHD patients and the vulnerability characteristics of coronary plaques. Methods This study recruited 180 subjects, among these, 90 CHD patients diagnosed between January 2023 and January 2024 were selected as the CHD group and 90 healthy volunteers were selected as the control group following a principle of 1:1 ratio. The differences in intestinal flora composition, metabolite levels, and blood biochemical indexes were compared between the two study groups. Based on the coronary angiography (CAG) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) results, the CHD group was divided into two sub-groups for stratified comparative analysis: the stable plaque group (n = 49) and the vulnerable plaque group (n = 41). Results The CHD group had reduced intestinal Bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria counts and higher intestinal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus levels than the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) levels were significantly higher in the CHD group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the CHD group exhibited substantially elevated serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to the control group. However, compared to the control group, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in the CHD group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Scr) were comparable in the two experimental groups (p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, intestinal Bifidobacteria, lactic acid bacteria, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus compositions were comparable in CHD patients with vulnerable plaque and those with stable plaque (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, CHD patients with vulnerable plaque had elevated TMAO and PAGln levels than those with stable plaque (p &lt; 0.05). However, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, ALT, AST, BUN, and Scr levels were comparable between CHD patients with a vulnerable plaque and those with stable plaque (p &gt; 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes, elevated TMAO levels, and elevated PAGln levels were potential risk factors for coronary plaque vulnerability (p &lt; 0.05).

AIP was calculated as lg (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Baseline AIP was stratified into quartiles (Q1-Q4). Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analyses were performed to examine the relationship between AIP and CVD.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11.67 years, 580 (22.50\u00a0%) OSA patients developed CVD, including 184 (7.10\u00a0%) with myocardial infarction (MI), and 400 (15.50\u00a0%) with coronary artery disease (CHD [including MI]), and 127 (4.90\u00a0%) with stroke.

However, there is a relative paucity of evidence exploring the correlation among RC, lipid ratios, and atherosclerotic lesion severity. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of RC and lipid ratios alone or in combination for the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).\nMETHODS: The Gensini score was used to assess the severity of coronary atherosclerotic lesions. CHD patients were categorized into mild stenosis and moderate-to-severe stenosis groups. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk of a high Gensini score associated with RC and lipid ratios. Our study also examined the relationship between inconsistencies in RC and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels and the severity of coronary artery stenosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive power of RC and lipid ratios alone or in combination for moderate to severe coronary artery lesions.\nRESULTS: Multivariate regression models suggested that RC was a strong predictor of moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis [odds ratio (OR): 5.44, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001]. When grouped by curve-fitting inflection points, the group with inconsistent high RC/low non-HDL-C, rather than the low RC/high non-HDL-C group, was associated with an increased risk of moderate to severe coronary stenosis compared with the consistent low RC group (OR: 2.72, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). ROC curves showed that RC predicted an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.715 for coronary stenosis severity, improving the predictive efficacy of the combined predictors comprising lipid ratios (AUC: 0.723 vs. 0.703, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: RC and various lipid ratios [triglyceride/HDL-C, total cholesterol/HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/HDL-C, and apoloprotein (apo)B/apoA] correlated with the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with CHD, suggesting that RC has potential value as a biomarker reflecting the degree of coronary artery stenosis independent of the traditional risk factors and the levels of non-HDL-C. This could enhance the predictive efficacy based on the lipid ratio model and had better predictive value for moderate to severe coronary artery lesions."

RCS analysis did not reveal a significant nonlinear relationship between the NHHR indicator and the risk of IHD in T2DM participants (P for nonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.9490). In the subgroup analysis, drinking status was found to have a joint effect with the NHHR on the incidence of IHD in T2DM patients (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.038).\nCONCLUSIONS: A high level of NHHR is associated with a high risk of IHD in T2DM patients, indicating the great importance of using NHHR in the lipid management of T2DM patients."

The patients were divided into MACEs (n\u2009=\u200960) and non-MACEs (n\u2009=\u20091317) groups. The study endpoints were MACEs, including cardiac-related mortality and rehospitalization for severe heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and in-stent restenosis.\nRESULTS: Both groups showed significant differences in the patients with age\u2009>\u200965\u2009years, history of HF, acute MI, cardiogenic shock, left ventricular ejection fraction <\u200940%, SIRI\u2009\u2265\u20092.848, SIRI/HDL-C\u2009\u2265\u20091.977, and SIRI\u2009\u00d7\u2009LDL-C\u2009\u2265\u20094.609.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a prevalent chronic disease affecting over 1.2 billion people worldwide, representing a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) and Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio are established metabolic indicators linked to the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Recently, a Cardiometabolic Index (CMI), combining WHtR and TG/HDL-C ratios, has been proposed to provide a comprehensive assessment of metabolic health. This study investigates the association between CMI and hypertension using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nMETHODS: The study utilized NHANES data from nine cycles spanning 2001 to 2018, encompassing 20,049 participants aged over 20. Exclusions were made for individuals with incomplete CMI or hypertension data, and pregnant women. CMI was calculated by multiplying the WHtR by the TG/HDL-C ratio. Hypertension was defined according to American Heart Association guidelines. The relationship between CMI and hypertension was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses, with additional subgroup analyses conducted based on demographic factors. Nonlinear relationships were analyzed using smoothing curve fitting techniques.\nRESULTS: The study identified a significant positive correlation between CMI and hypertension risk, with an increase of one unit in CMI associated with a 9% heightened risk of hypertension (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13). The association remained significant across various demographic subgroups. A nonlinear relationship was observed, with a critical CMI threshold of 2.64. Below this threshold, higher CMI values were associated with a progressively higher prevalence of hypertension, whereas beyond this threshold, further increases in CMI did not significantly correlate with an elevated risk of hypertension.\nCONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that CMI is significantly associated with hypertension risk and may serve as a valuable tool for early screening and risk assessment, particularly in identifying individuals at higher risk before reaching the critical CMI threshold. These results underscore the importance of addressing metabolic health in the prevention and management of hypertension. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to establish causality, explore the clinical utility of CMI in hypertension screening, and examine its applicability in diverse populations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), significantly affecting patient outcomes. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a marker of insulin resistance, has shown potential in predicting various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the TyG index for AKI occurrence following CABG.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included 3,260 patients who underwent CABG. Patients were categorized into AKI and non-AKI groups based on postoperative renal function. The preoperative TyG index was calculated from fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels. Patients were further divided into quartiles based on the TyG index. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between TyG index and AKI risk. Subgroup analyses and spline regression were employed to explore potential interactions and non-linear relationships.\nRESULTS: Of the 3,260 patients, 514 (15.8%) developed AKI. Baseline characteristics showed that AKI patients had significantly higher levels of hemoglobin (Hb), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and glucose, while brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were lower compared to non-AKI patients. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the TyG index was an independent risk factor for AKI following CABG, both as a continuous variable (OR 1.034 [95% CI 1.017-1.050], p\u2009<\u20090.001) and when grouped by quartiles. A non-linear relationship between TyG index and AKI risk was observed, with a significant increase in AKI risk when the TyG index exceeded 5.4. Subgroup analyses revealed that this association was consistent across multiple patient groups, including those stratified by age, sex, BMI, extracorporeal circulation use, and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: The preoperative TyG index is a significant independent predictor of AKI after CABG, with a dose-response relationship observed across various subgroups. Monitoring the TyG index can help identify high-risk patients, potentially guiding early intervention and improving postoperative outcomes. These findings underscore the potential of the TyG index as a valuable tool for predicting AKI in clinical practice, warranting further validation in prospective studies."

No secondary outcome measures were performed.\nRESULTS: All patients were divided into four groups according to the quartiles of the HDL-C/CRP ratio. Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of all-cause mortality was always the highest for Q1 (HDL-C/CRP<0.395) and the lowest for group Q4 (HDL-C/CRP\u22653.4163). Cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that HDL-C/CRP was consistently an independent risk factor for death from CHF. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve for HDL-C/CRP was 0.7254 (p<0.001), with a sensitivity of 65.5% and a specificity of 69.6%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The HDL-C/CRP ratio is an independent prognostic indicator of all-cause mortality in patients with CHF in NYHA cardiac function class III/IV, which has good specificity and sensitivity. Patients with lower levels of the HDL-C/CRP ratio are at a greater risk of death than patients with higher levels of the HDL-C/CRP ratio."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to address the complex relationship between dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD), emphasizing its dual role in driving cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and contributing to CKD progression. It explores pathophysiological mechanisms, highlights recent biomarker discoveries, and evaluates contemporary and emerging lipid-lowering therapies tailored for CKD patients.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted the inadequacy of traditional lipid markers like LDL-C in reflecting cardiovascular risk in CKD. Novel biomarkers, such as remnant cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), demonstrate stronger associations with adverse outcomes. Emerging lipid-lowering agents, including bempedoic acid, pemafibrate, and PCSK9 inhibitors, show promise for risk reduction, especially in non-dialysis-dependent CKD. However, evidence remains limited for advanced stages of CKD and dialysis patients. Furthermore, alterations in lipid metabolism, such as dysfunctional HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are now recognized as significant contributors to CVD and renal damage in CKD populations. Dyslipidemia is a pivotal modifiable risk factor in CKD, exacerbating both cardiovascular risk and disease progression. While statins remain the cornerstone of therapy in early-to-moderate CKD, their efficacy diminishes in advanced stages. The advent of novel therapeutic options and a deeper understanding of dyslipidemia's pathophysiology hold potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize personalized approaches, focusing on the unique metabolic derangements of CKD and advancing treatments for high-risk and dialysis-dependent patients."

We investigated the relative impact of triglycerides (TGs) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on outcomes in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for established ASCVD.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We included 9446 statin-treated patients with LDL-C < 70\u2005mg/dL undergoing PCI between 2012 and 2022, stratified into four groups: (i) no residual risk (TG <150\u2005mg/dL + hs-CRP <2\u2005mg/L); (ii) residual TG risk (TG \u2265150\u2005mg/dL + hs-CRP <2\u2005mg/L); (iii) residual inflammatory risk (TG <150\u2005mg/dL + hs-CRP \u22652\u2005mg/L); and (iv) residual TG and inflammatory risk (TG \u2265150\u2005mg/dL + hs-CRP \u22652\u2005mg/L). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year, consisting of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Cox regression analysis was performed, using the no residual risk group as a reference. Of the total population, 5339 (56.5%) had no residual risk, 555 (5.9%) presented residual TG risk, 3009 (31.9%) had residual inflammatory risk, and 543 (5.7%) exhibited residual combined risk. After multivariable adjustment, patients with residual inflammatory or combined risk showed a significantly higher hazard of MACE, mainly driven by all-cause mortality. No significant difference was observed between patients with residual TG risk and those with no residual risk.\nCONCLUSION: In statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C undergoing PCI, residual inflammatory risk-alone or in combination with residual TG risk-was associated with a higher incidence of MACE, highlighting the need for targeted preventive strategies beyond LDL-C lowering."

However, the relationship between long-term AIP trajectories and CVD remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations between AIP trajectories and the incidence of CVD in the English population.\nMETHOD: The study data analysis was based on the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) from 2004 to 2017. The study population consisted of individuals aged 50 years and older in England. AIP was calculated as log<sub>10</sub> (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was applied to identify the trajectory of the AIP index from Wave 2 to 8 over a 12-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were then used to analyze the associations between different AIP index trajectory groups and the incidence of CVD.\nRESULTS: A total of 3976 participants with completed AIP data in Wave 2 and more than two AIP measurements between Wave 2 and Wave 8 were enrolled in the ELSA cohort. The participants were divided into three groups [low-stable group (n\u2009=\u20091146), moderate-stable group (n\u2009=\u20092110), high-stable group (n\u2009=\u2009720)] using a GBTM model. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants in the high-stable group indicated an increased risk of developing incident of CVD compared to those in the low-stable AIP group [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.33; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-1.74, P\u2009=\u20090.033]. However, no differences in the incidence of CVD (HR 1.20, 95%CI 0.98-1.48, P\u2009=\u20090.082) were observed in the moderate-stable group. Subgroup analysis indicated similar results for participants under 63 years old and those with high alcohol consumption.\nCONCLUSIONS: A high and sustainable level of the AIP index may contribute to the incidence of CVD. The trajectories of the AIP index can help identify older English individuals at increased risk of CVD who deserve primitive preventive and therapeutic approaches."

Methods: The subjects were from the PROMISE study. This study was a prospective cohort study led by Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, with participation from eight regional tertiary hospitals as sub-centers, and enrolled 18 701 patients with confirmed coronary heart disease between January 2015 and May 2019. Among them, 8 429 patients with ACS were included in this study. The estimated cumulative LDL-C exposure was calculated by multiplying LDL-C by age. Participants were then divided into four groups based on quartiles. Baseline data and coronary angiography data were collected, and participants were followed for 2 years. The primary endpoint was MACCE, which was composed of all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and stroke. Spearman correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation between cumulative LDL-C exposure and the severity of coronary artery disease. The differences in MACCE among the four groups were compared, and multivariate Cox regression was used to divide the estimated cumulative exposure LDL-C into two groups, three groups, and four groups to analyze its relationship with MACCE. Results: The 8 429 ACS patients included in the study had an age of (60.9\u00b111.4) years, with 1 951(23.1%) females. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that estimated cumulative LDL-C exposure was positively associated with the preoperative SYNTAX score, three-vessel lesions disease, left main disease, and the number of target lesions (correlation coefficients r=0.14, 0.10, 0.04 and 0.03, respectively, with all P&lt;0.05). The 2-year follow-up results indicated that the incidence rates of MACCE, all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in ACS patients grouped by different levels of estimated cumulative LDL-C exposure were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). The results of the Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that when the estimated cumulative LDL-C exposure was treated as a continuous variable and analyzed in two, three, and four groups, with the lowest group as the reference, the risk of MACCE occurrence in the high-value group increased by 21% (95%CI 1.08-1.37, P=0.002), 24% (95%CI 1.07-1.43, P=0.004), and 21% (95%CI 1.02-1.43, P=0.025) respectively. Conclusions: A positive correlation was found between estimated cumulative LDL-C exposure and severity of coronary artery disease.

This study explored the association between surrogate IR indices, including triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference (TyG-WC), triglyceride glucose-waist to height ratio (TyG-WHtR), metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), and the triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio, and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).\nMETHODS: Patients with T2D were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups, matched for age and diabetes duration: those with CAD and those without CAD. The association between surrogate IR indices and CAD was evaluated using restricted cubic spline (RCS) and multivariable logistic regression and their discriminative ability was assessed via Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Additionally, machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were employed to predict CAD presence using multiple surrogate IR indices and their components.\nRESULTS: All surrogate IR indices exhibited non-linear associations with CAD. TyG demonstrated a U-shaped relationship, where both extremely low and high levels were associated with higher odds of CAD compared to intermediate levels. The surrogate IR indices showed a relatively strong discriminative ability for CAD, with AUC values exceeding 0.708 across all indices. The TG/HDL-C ratio displayed the highest AUC (0.721), accuracy (68%), and sensitivity (71%), whereas TyG-WC showed the highest specificity (78%). Machine learning algorithms (except logistic regression) demonstrated greater discriminative power than individual IR indices. Random forest and XGBoost revealed the best performance when using either multiple surrogate IR indices or their components.\nCONCLUSIONS: Surrogate IR indices could be used as valuable tools for evaluating cardiometabolic risk in patients with T2D, who are at high risk for CAD. Integrating machine learning models further improved CAD prediction, underscoring their potential for better risk stratification. The observed association between these indices and CAD in T2D may help clarify the complex pathophysiology of CAD and offer insights for future research."

White matter (WM) alterations are among the earliest changes in AD, yet limited work has comprehensively characterized the effects of AD risk factors on WM. In older adults with a family history of AD, we investigated the sex-specific and APOE genotype-related relationships between WM microstructure and risk factors. Multiple MRI-derived metrics were integrated using a multivariate approach based on the Mahalanobis distance (D2). To uncover the specific biological underpinnings of these WM alterations, we then extracted the contribution of each MRI feature to D2 in significant clusters. Lastly, the links between WM D2 and cognition were explored. WM D2 in several regions was associated with high systolic blood pressure, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin, and low cholesterol, in both males and females. APOE4\u202f+\u202fdisplayed a distinct risk pattern, with LDL-cholesterol having a detrimental effect only in carriers, and this pattern was linked to immediate memory performance. Myelination was the main mechanism underlying WM alterations. Our findings reveal that combined exposure to multiple cardiometabolic risk factors negatively impacts microstructural health, which may subsequently affect cognition. Notably, APOE4 carriers exhibited a different risk pattern, especially in the role of LDL, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms in this group."

We used summary statistics data from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KOGES) for LDL-C data, and Biobank of Japan (BBJ) for CAD data.\nRESULTS: For every 10\u00a0mg/dl decrease in LDL-C determined by four significant SNPs in the PCSK9 gene, the risk of CAD decreased by approximately 20% (OR\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% CI: 0.75-0.86). The risk of CAD decreased by 10% for every 10\u00a0mg/dl decrease in LDL-C due to the six significant SNPs in the HMGCR gene (OR\u2009=\u20090.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.94). Due to the two significant SNPs in the gene LDLR, the risk of CAD decreased by approximately 26% for every 10\u00a0mg/dl decrease in LDL-C (OR\u2009=\u20090.74, 95% CI: 0.66-0.82). The combined effect on CAD showed the largest effect size for the PCSK9 gene and LDLR gene, and the reduced CAD risk induced by these two genes together was OR\u2009=\u20090.78 (95%CI, 0.74-0.83). Finally, the combined effect of all three genes (PCSK9, HMGCR, and LDLR) was OR\u2009=\u20090.85 (95%CI, 0.79-0.91).\nCONCLUSION: LDL-C reduction estimated by SNPs in LDL-C lowering drug target genes significantly reduced the risk of CAD. We found the potential of using of proxy research design for clinical trials using LDL-C lowering drugs."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains a major public health challenge in China. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the burden of IHD, its risk factors, and future trends from 1990 to 2021 using the Global Burden of Disease database.\nMETHODS: We assessed IHD trends in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) stratified by age (greater than 15 years) and gender. Age-standardized rates, average annual percentage changes, and joinpoint regression analyses were used to evaluate temporal trends. Decomposition and frontier analyses were conducted to identify key contributors to the IHD burden, while future projections were generated for the next 15 years.\nRESULTS: In 2021, the number of IHD incident cases, prevalent cases, deaths, and DALYs in China were 3.17, 3.25, 3.57, and 2.62 times higher than those in 1990, respectively. Age-standardized mortality rates and age-standardized DALYs rates demonstrated an initial increase, followed by a gradual decline. Males showed higher IHD burden during middle age, while elderly females surpassed males in the later years. Aging, high systolic blood pressure, ambient particulate matter pollution, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking were the primary drivers of IHD burden. Future projections suggest a declining incidence and prevalence among males but increasing trends in females, with DALYs expected to rise significantly in the female population.\nCONCLUSIONS: The burden of IHD in China has evolved significantly over the past three decades, driven by demographic and environmental factors. While prevalence and incidence have risen, mortality and DALYs have shown a recent decline, reflecting shifts in disease patterns. Age and gender disparities are evident, with middle-aged males and elderly females disproportionately affected. Key contributors, such as high blood pressure and pollution, highlight the need for targeted interventions. Gender-specific public health strategies, alongside improved environmental and health policies, are essential to mitigating the future burden of IHD in China."

            "title": "The Cholesterol Paradox in Long-Livers from a Sardinia Longevity Hot Spot (Blue Zone).",
            "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Hypercholesterolemia is commonly viewed as a risk factor for coronary heart disease; however, several studies have reported an inverse relationship between cholesterol levels and cardiovascular mortality, particularly in older adults. This \"cholesterol paradox\" challenges the conventional understanding of lipid metabolism. Despite often being dismissed as a result of reverse causality, the precise causes of this paradox remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the potential existence of the cholesterol paradox in a long-lived population from central Sardinia, Italy. Methods: We recruited 168 baseline nonagenarians (81 males, 87 females) from the longevity Blue Zone area in 2018 and followed them until December 2024. The lipid profile was determined for all participants according to current guidelines, and its impact on survival was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The median total cholesterol was 199.5 (range 89-314) mg/dL in males and 202.5 (range 89-324) mg/dL in females. Survival time was significantly longer in participants with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) above 130 mg/dL compared to that in nonagenarians with LDL-C lower than 130 mg/dL (3.82 \u00b1 1.88 years vs. 2.79 \u00b1 1.56 years, p &lt; 0.0001). Cox regression analysis revealed a significant reduction in the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in participants with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C \u2265 130 mg/dL) compared to that in those with normal cholesterol (OR 0.600, 95%CI 0.405-0.891). Conclusions: In the long-lived population examined, the cholesterol paradox was unlikely to be a reflection of reverse causality. Our results challenge the common view that longevity is invariably associated with low cholesterol levels. Furthermore, moderate hypercholesterolemia does not preclude the oldest adult from attaining advanced ages, contrary to common belief."

Our goal in this study was to examine the relationships between BMI and traditional and non-traditional ASCVD risk factors. Methods. We measured levels of blood glucose, insulin, lipids, lipoproteins, sterols, fatty acids, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and hormones in 226,000 middle-aged and elderly subjects (55% women) and associated those parameters to BMI in 5 groups (BMI 20-25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35, 35.1-40, and &gt;40 kg/m2). Results. BMI and age were inversely correlated in both sexes. All of the traditional and non-traditional ASCVD risk markers, except low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), changed significantly in unfavorable ways in both sexes with increasing BMI. The largest changes were observed in the high sensitivity C-reactive protein, which increased 6- and 8-fold, and insulin, which increased 4- and 3-fold between the lowest and highest BMI groups in men and women, respectively. Although the LDL-C levels changed little, small dense LDL-C and triglyceride levels increased significantly with increasing BMI. Markers of cholesterol synthesis were positively associated with BMI, while markers of cholesterol absorption and omega-3 fatty acids were inversely associated with BMI. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the athero-protective, large-size HDL particles were also inversely associated with BMI. Our analysis indicated that the associations between an elevated BMI and unfavorable changes in major ASCVD risk factors were independent of age in both sexes. Moreover, we observed that ASCVD risk factors started changing unfavorably with increasing BMI even in the normal weight range (BMI 20-25 kg/m2). Conclusions. An elevated BMI is associated with unfavorable changes in traditional and non-traditional ASCVD risk factors independent of age. Therefore, maintaining a normal BMI, preferably by an active lifestyle, and, if necessary, weight-managing medication, is very important to avoid developing conditions leading to ASCVD."

This study sought to investigate the association between PPI use and lung cancer likelihood and mortality, focusing on the impact of PPI exposure history and duration.\nMETHODS: This study utilized data from 6795 lung cancer patients, 27,180 matched controls, and 4257 deceased and 2538 surviving lung cancer patients from the Korean National Health Insurance Service's Health Screening Cohort (2002-2019). Propensity score overlap weighting and logistic regression models were applied to assess the correlations between PPI usage history and duration with lung cancer risk and mortality, while standardized differences ensured balanced baseline characteristics.\nRESULTS: Overall, PPI use was modestly associated, with a 19% increased likelihood of lung cancer occurrence (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.12-1.26). Interestingly, prolonged PPI use (\u226530 days) was linked to a 13% reduction in lung cancer incidence (95% CI: 0.80-0.94), particularly in subgroups such as older adults (\u226570 years), individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or hypertension, and those with low alcohol consumption. Conversely, overall PPI usage was linked with a 36% increased mortality likelihood among lung cancer patients (95% CI: 1.20-1.55), with prolonged use further correlating with a 27% higher mortality risk (95% CI: 1.05-1.53), especially in high-risk subgroups, including smokers, underweight individuals, and those with hypercholesterolemia or GERD.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings may suggest a complex and context-dependent relationship between PPI use and lung cancer outcomes, emphasizing the need for individualized risk assessments and careful prescribing practices."

Subgroup analyses revealed that sesame supplementation significantly reduced CRP and malondialdehyde (MDA) in populations without chronic diseases, while total cholesterol (TC) and MDA were reduced in those with chronic diseases. MDA was significantly reduced in females, especially those aged 50 or older. At dosages of 10\u00a0g per day or less, CRP, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and TC showed significant improvements. Meta-regression highlighted a significant dose-dependent reduction in TC levels at 10\u00a0g/day, and a significant duration-dependent decrease in TG levels at 8 weeks of supplementation. Sesame supplementation demonstrates potential benefits in improving glycemic control, inflammatory markers, and lipid profiles, making it a promising adjunct therapy for reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors."

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PHR, FHR, and in-hospital mortality risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included patients with first-time AMI at Cangzhou People's Hospital, China, from 2020 to 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between PHR, FHR, and in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to visualize the dose-response relationship between PHR, FHR, and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the predictive value of PHR and FHR for in-hospital mortality. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: In the study, 170 out of 2398 patients with AMI (7.09%) died. In the multivariable logistic regression model, both PHR and FHR were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI. The adjusted RCS regression analysis indicated that there is no significant nonlinear association between PHR, FHR, and in-hospital mortality. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for PHR and FHR was 0.718 (95% CI: 0.700-0.736, p\u202f<\u20090.001) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.699-0.735, p\u202f<\u20090.001), respectively.

This study aims to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the CHG index in comparison to the well-established Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index.\nMETHODS: In this cohort study, 6249 adults aged 45 and older were recruited from the CHARLS database, with data collected from 2011 to 2020. CVD events were tracked over a nine-year follow-up. The TyG and CHG indices were calculated, and their relationships with CVD risk were assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was performed to further explore these associations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to compare the predictive performance of both indices, and subgroup analysis evaluated their applicability in different populations.\nRESULTS: Among the 6249 participants, 1667 (26.68%) developed CVD during the nine-year follow-up. In unadjusted Cox regression models, the TyG index had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.18 (95% confidence interval CI 1.10-1.27, p\u2009<\u20090.001), while the CHG index showed a higher HR of 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the adjusted models, the relationship still persisted. The RCS models showed that the TyG index exhibited a non-linear relationship with the risk of CVD, while the CHG index demonstrated a positive linear correlation. ROC curve analysis revealed comparable predictive performance for both indices. The subgroup analysis indicated that there was no interaction between the subgroups and the both indices (p for interaction\u2009>\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: An elevated CHG index is significantly correlated with an increased risk of CVD, demonstrating a linear relationship.

A valid and reliable questionnaire was administered after randomly selecting study participants from 48 primary healthcare centers. Univariate analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between independent variables and hypertension. P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the major associated factors of hypertension among Saudi citizens. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was presented for each of the adjusted odds ratios (AORs).\nRESULTS: It was found that 11.1% of research participants reported having hypertension.

            "abstract": "Obesity, a global health concern, is associated with severe health issues like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory complications. It also increases the risk of various cancers, including melanoma, endometrial, prostate, pancreatic, esophageal adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, renal adenocarcinoma, and pre-and post-menopausal breast cancer. Obesity-induced cellular changes, such as impaired CD8+ T cell function, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, mild hyperglycemia, and fluctuating levels of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and IL-6, contribute to cancer development by promoting inflammation and creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment rich in adipocytes. Adipocytes release leptin, a pro-inflammatory substance that stimulates cancer cell proliferation, inflammation, and invasion, altering the tumor cell metabolic pathway. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is typically downregulated in obese individuals. It has antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic properties, making it a potential cancer treatment. This narrative review offers a comprehensive examination of the molecular interconnections between obesity and cancer, drawing on an extensive, though non-systematic, survey of the recent literature. This approach allows us to integrate and synthesize findings from various studies, offering a cohesive perspective on emerging themes and potential therapeutic targets. The review explores the metabolic disturbances, cellular alterations, inflammatory responses, and shifts in the tumor microenvironment that contribute to the obesity-cancer link. Finally, it discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting these connections, offering valuable insights into future research directions and the development of targeted interventions."

Mean risk factor levels that were lower in women than men include systolic blood pressure (women-to-men difference: -5.6\u2009mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (-3.4\u2009mm Hg), body mass index (-0.75\u2009kg/m2), waist circumference (-12.2\u2009cm), triglycerides (0.34\u2009mmol/L), glycated haemoglobin (-0.52\u2009mmol/mol) and glucose (-0.08\u2009mmol/L), while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.31\u2009mmol/L) and C reactive protein (+0.08\u2009mg/L) were higher among women. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were lower in women than men at younger ages (-0.23 and -0.30\u2009mmol/L, respectively, at &lt;50 years), and higher at older ages (+0.74\u2009and +0.41\u2009mmol/L, at \u226560 years).

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is a complex clinical condition characterized by the simultaneous dysfunction of the heart and kidneys. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of triglycerides (TG) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), has emerged as a potential biomarker for cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the association between AIP and CRS, aiming to explore the potential linkage between AIP and CRS.\nMETHODS: Data were sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning 2005-2018, involving 35,365 participants after applying exclusion criteria. The primary exposure variable was AIP, categorized into quartiles, while the primary outcome variable was CRS, defined by the coexistence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Statistical analyses, considering sample weights, included ANOVA, Chi-square tests, logistic regression models, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis to examine nonlinear relationships.\nRESULTS: The weighted logistic regression analysis showed a positive correlation between AIP and CRS across all models. In the fully adjusted model, the highest AIP quartile had a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for CRS (Q4: OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.21-2.15). RCS analysis confirmed a positive correlation between AIP and CRS, with TG positively and HDL-C negatively correlated with CRS. Subgroup analysis indicated a significant interaction with hypertension, showing a stronger association in non-hypertensive individuals.\nCONCLUSION: Higher AIP levels are associated with an increased prevalence of CRS, with a notable hypertension-specific interaction indicating a higher effect in individuals without hypertension."

            "abstract": "People with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a higher risk (2-4 times) for cardiovascular (CV) death and atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) than the general population. A multifactorial approach is recommended to reduce CV risk. Since low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major causal and cumulative risk factor for ASCVD, the management of lipids is a fundamental element in global risk reduction. Intensive lipid lowering therapy (LLT), such as the addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i), to achieve LDL-C goals and reduce the risk of first or recurrent CV events in people with DM at very high CV risk (VHCVR) of ASCVD (i.e. acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease) is often required. Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9, as lipid-lowering therapy offers significant CV benefits and a favourable safety profile in people with DM and a VHCVR, with or without previous CV events. This review highlights the role of LDL-C in the complex pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, summarises the guidelines for CV risk reduction related to LDL-C in patients with DM and a VHCVR, and focuses on the role of alirocumab in managing LDL-C and consequent CV risk reduction in these patients."

While apolipoprotein B (ApoB) has been proposed as a goal for lipid-lowering therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, its association with plaque stability has not been studied.\nMETHODS: The High-Resolution Assessment of Coronary Plaques in a Global Evolocumab Randomized Study (HUYGENS) used serial optical coherence tomography to assess coronary plaque phenotypes in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with evolocumab plus statin or placebo plus statin for 52 weeks. Changes in plaque composition were studied in patients according to achievement of a goal ApoB level <65\u00a0mg/dL.\nRESULTS: Of 112 patients, 67 (59.8\u00a0%) achieved the ApoB goal and had lower ApoB values at follow-up compared with those not at goal (37.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.0 vs 92.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.4\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the critical need for effective preventive therapies. Statins, or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are widely prescribed for their ability to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduce CV risk. This systematic review evaluates the long-term impact of statins on CV and all-cause mortality across diverse populations, including those with chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, and other comorbid conditions. A comprehensive search of major databases identified randomized controlled trials and large observational cohort studies with follow-up periods exceeding one year. Findings demonstrated significant reductions in CV mortality (hazard ratio (HR) range: 0.38-0.76) and all-cause mortality (HR range: 0.55-0.80) with statin therapy, particularly among high-risk groups, such as individuals with elevated LDL-C and moderate chronic kidney disease. Additional benefits were observed in preventing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Subgroup analyses revealed variations in efficacy based on age, sex, comorbidities, and statin type or dosage, with some populations, such as those with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, showing limited benefit. Geographic and ethnic diversity were underrepresented in the included studies, and data on long-term effects in populations with advanced renal impairment or inflammatory conditions remain insufficient. These gaps underscore the need for methodologically robust studies and tailored approaches to statin therapy that account for individual patient profiles, including comorbidities and demographic factors. Practical steps include integrating statins with newer lipid-lowering agents and developing personalized treatment protocols to maximize their benefits and minimize risks. This review reinforces the critical role of statins in reducing the global burden of CVDs while emphasizing areas for future research."

            "abstract": "The role of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in contributing to an individual's susceptibility to coronary atherosclerosis and how low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations might modify this relationship have not been previously studied. Here, from an examination of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), we identified variants with effects on EC function and constructed a 35 single nucleotide polymorphism polygenic risk score comprising these EC-specific variants (EC PRS). The association of the EC PRS with the risk of incident cardiovascular disease was tested in 3 cohorts: a primary prevention population in the UK Biobank (UKBB; n\u2009=\u2009348,967); a primary prevention cohort from a trial that tested a statin (JUPITER, n\u2009=\u20098,749); and a secondary prevention cohort that tested a PCSK9 inhibitor (FOURIER, n\u2009=\u200914,298). In the UKBB, the EC PRS was independently associated with the risk of incident CAD (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) per 1 s.d. of 1.24 (95% CI 1.21-1.26), P\u2009&lt;\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16). Moreover, LDL-C concentration significantly modified this risk: the aHR per 1 s.d. was 1.26 (1.22-1.30) when LDL-C was 150\u2009mg\u2009dl-1 but 1.00 (0.85-1.16) when LDL-C was 50\u2009mg\u2009dl-1 (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.004). The clinical benefit of LDL-C lowering was significantly greater in individuals with a high EC PRS than in individuals with low or intermediate EC PRS, with relative risk reductions of 68% (HR 0.32 (0.18-0.59)) versus 29% (HR 0.71 (0.52-0.95)) in the primary prevention cohort (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.02) and 33% (HR 0.67 (0.53-0.83)) versus 8% (HR 0.92 (0.82-1.03)) in the secondary prevention cohort (P<sub>interaction</sub>\u2009=\u20090.01). We conclude that EC PRS quantifies an independent axis of CAD risk that is not currently captured in medical practice and identifies individuals who are more sensitive to the atherogenic effects of LDL-C and who would potentially derive substantially greater benefit from aggressive LDL-C lowering."

Given the significant role of diet in the pathogenesis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, this study rigorously investigates the causal relationship between dietary habits and myocardial infarction.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This study used large-scale genome-wide association studies with pooled UK Biobank data to explore associations between 9 dietary categories (83 types) and myocardial infarction. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach was applied to assess these associations, while multivariate Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses investigated the role of lipids in mediating the effects of diet on myocardial infarction. Univariate Mendelian analyses revealed genetic associations among 9 categories of dietary habits (83 types) and myocardial infarction. Notably, robust evidence indicates the \"tablespoons of cooked vegetables per day\" as the most significant risk factor for myocardial infarction development. \"Coffee consumption(cups per day)\" and \"frequency of adding salt to food\" were also identified as supplementary risk factors. In contrast, \"overall alcohol intake\" showed a protective effect, potentially by increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.48% mediation) and reducing triglycerides (6.24% mediation). Cereal category, particularly \"cereal consumption (bowls per week)\" was associated with reduced myocardial infarction risk, contributing by raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.69% mediation) and lowering total cholesterol (8.33% mediation). Additionally, \"overall cheese consumption\" was also protective against myocardial infarction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings elucidate the influence of dietary habits on myocardial infarction, showing underlying genetic mechanisms and emphasizing the regulatory role of lipids as an intermediate."

            "abstract": "Hypertension is a prevalent chronic non-communicable disease associated with cardiovascular issues, strokes, kidney disorders, and depression. Most hypertensive patients have dyslipidemia and metabolic abnormalities. The non-high-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHHR) is a novel index that more accurately assesses the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and metabolic issues like insulin resistance. The association between NHHR and hypertension prevalence is still unclear. The study aims to examine the link between NHHR and hypertension prevalence in American adults. N10,410 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2005-2016) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable logistic regression constructed to analyze the relationship between NHHR and hypertension, with additional analyses including restricted cubic spline regression (RCS), threshold and saturation effect analyses, effect point calculations, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses. Machine learning methods combined with the Boruta algorithm were employed to identify key predictors of hypertension risk. Of the 10,410 participants, 48% were male, with a hypertension prevalence of 37.03%. NHHR was higher in hypertensive patients compared to non-hypertensive individuals (2.74 vs 2.90, P\u2005<\u2005.001). In models that were completely confounded with factors including general demographic data, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, total cholesterol, history of coronary heart disease, LDL, and dietary cholesterol, NHHR showed a significant positive correlation with hypertension prevalence. RCS regression indicated a non-linear relationship, with a saturation effect point at 3.058. Subgroup analyses showed significant interactions by race and education level (P\u2005<\u2005.05). Machine learning models demonstrated AUCs\u2005>\u20050.8, affirming the importance of NHHR in predicting hypertension. NHHR levels are significantly elevated in hypertensive individuals compared to non-hypertensive adults in the U.S. Furthermore, a non-linear positive correlation exists between NHHR and hypertension risk, suggesting its potential as a predictive biomarker for early hypertension prevention."

Previous studies demonstrated that 7-KC can elicit effects on macrophage function; however, effects of 7-KC on the macrophage proteome have not been studied systematically. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to establish the effect of 7-KC on the mouse macrophage proteome. 7-KC independently mediated dynamic changes, including on atherogenic/M1 markers, cholesterol metabolism, biosynthesis and transport, as well as nutrient transport more broadly. These changes were however insufficient alone to drive changes in cytokine and chemokine secretion. Rather, they prime the macrophage, potentiating LPS-stimulated TNF alpha secretion and key pro-inflammatory enzymes. Our results indicate that 7-KC has independent metabolic effects on the macrophage; however, effects on the immune system are primarily due to the changes in metabolism priming the response to an inflammatory stimulus. Earlier findings from CANTOS and the recent FDA approval of colchicine highlight that inflammation is a viable target for cardiovascular disease; however, it is currrently unclear which will be the best anti-inflammatory targets to pursue in the future. In this context, our findings suggest that drugs targeting atherogenic markers induced by 7-KC might be well tolerated, as they will not necessarily be expected to be immunosuppressive."

This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of Factor XI/XIa inhibitors compared to DOACs in AF patients.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Factor XI/XIa inhibitors with DOACs in AF patients, identified through PubMed and Embase up to January 2025. Data were synthesized narratively due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes.ResultsThree RCTs (AZALEA-TIMI 71, OCEANIC-AF, PACIFIC-AF) involving 16\u2005852 patients were included. Factor XI/XIa inhibitors (abelacimab and asundexian) demonstrated significant reductions in bleeding compared to DOACs. In AZALEA-TIMI 71, abelacimab reduced major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding by 62%-69% versus rivaroxaban. In PACIFIC-AF, asundexian reduced bleeding by 50%-84% compared to apixaban.

Whether medical therapy-using antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants-or transcatheter device closure offers superior protection against stroke recurrence has been a topic of considerable debate. This systematic review aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of these two treatment strategies, incorporating recent studies to provide updated insights on the most effective approach to preventing recurrent cryptogenic stroke.\nMETHODOLOGY: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Ovid database through December 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing PFO closure versus medical therapy among patients with cryptogenic stroke.\nRESULTS: This systematic review analyzed 7 RCTs encompassing 4539 patients with a mean age of 43.6 years, 53.38 % of whom were male. Patient characteristics, including comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, were well-balanced across groups receiving PFO closure or medical therapy. The primary analysis revealed a significant reduction in stroke incidence with PFO closure compared to medical therapy, with no stroke events in the PFO closure groups of the CLOSE and DEFENSE-PFO trials. Similarly, transient ischemic attack (TIA) incidence was consistently lower in PFO closure groups. All-cause mortality was comparable between groups, underscoring the safety profile of PFO closure. However, PFO closure was associated with a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation. Major bleeding risks varied, reflecting the need for tailored risk assessment.\nCONCLUSION: PFO closure offers a significant advantage over medical therapy in preventing recurrent cryptogenic stroke and TIA. Nevertheless, the observed increase in atrial fibrillation postclosure highlights the need for additional research to elucidate its long-term implications and to determine whether anticoagulation could benefit specific subsets of patients with PFO and a history of stroke."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common clinical arrhythmia, primarily associated with the risk of stroke and various thromboembolic events, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on patients and societies. This study aimed to review the relevant pharmacoeconomic evaluations of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF and explore the influencing factors and general trends of economic evaluations.\nMETHODS: This review qualitatively analyzed the basic characteristics, model structure, and basic results of all included studies. Moreover, a cross-sectional and longitudinal comparative analysis of costs, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness results of studies in the United States, China, and the United Kingdom was conducted. Additionally, this study employed multivariate binary logistic regression to explore the influencing factors and general trends of the cost-effectiveness between NOACs and VKAs across all included studies.\nRESULTS: A total of 103 studies were included, comprising 218 comparisons between NOACs and VKAs. Total costs and health outcomes measured in studies with different countries and baseline characteristics exhibited considerable variations. However, NOACs generally had higher total costs than VKAs and resulted in more health outcomes for patients. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the country's economic development level, study perspective, and cycle length significantly influenced cost-effectiveness results.\nCONCLUSION: In high-income countries, NOACs are generally considered cost-effective, while VKAs may remain an attractive strategy in middle- and low-income countries. Additionally, factors such as drug prices, patient baseline characteristics, and model settings could impact the costs, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness results of studies. Conducting relevant pharmacoeconomic research based on specific populations and study contexts is essential."

We aimed to assess comprehensive outcome data for the Korean population receiving ICM insertions.\nMETHODS: Using a Korean nationwide claims database, patients who underwent ICM insertion from 2010 to 2021 (N\u202f=\u202f3152) were selected. The subjects were divided into three groups based on the indication of the procedure: recurrent syncope (n\u202f=\u202f1389), palpitation (n\u202f=\u202f146), cryptogenic stroke (n\u202f=\u202f994) and unidentifiable (n\u202f=\u202f623). The clinical outcomes, including new diagnoses of arrhythmias and therapeutic interventions following ICM insertion, were evaluated in each group.\nRESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 18.5\u202fmonths (interquartile range: 7.3-33.7). In the syncope group, pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator were implanted in 396 (28.5\u202f%) and 27 (1.9\u202f%) patients following ICM insertion. Age (\u226570 vs. <60, Hazard ratio [HR]: 2.090, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and prevalent atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL)(HR: 1.891, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) were independent risk factors for the cardiac device therapy. In the palpitation group, various arrhythmias, including AF/AFL (n\u202f=\u202f7), supraventricular tachycardia (n\u202f=\u202f2), and other arrhythmias (n\u202f=\u202f13), were identified in 19 (13.6\u202f%) patients. In the cryptogenic stroke group, new-onset AF/AFLs occurred in 91 (9.7\u202f%) patients. The initiation of direct oral anticoagulants was noted in 8.9\u202f% of anticoagulation-na\u00efve cryptogenic stroke patients during follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: ICM insertion led to significant diagnostic and therapeutic interventions across all indication groups, with notable rates of device implantation and arrhythmia detection.

This condition is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality, being closely linked to an elevated risk of heart failure, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, and dementia. The complexities of managing AF in the elderly arise from age-related physiological changes, comorbidities, frailty, and the challenges of polypharmacy. Therapeutic strategies must balance efficacy and safety, tailoring interventions to the individual's health status, life expectancy, and personal preferences.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is used for stroke prevention in AF, but it also increases bleeding risk. Clinical guidelines do not definitively recommend for or against OAC for patients with borderline stroke risk. Decision-making may benefit from values clarification exercises to communicate risk trade-offs.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate if a visual with a values clarification alters the understanding of the trade-offs of anticoagulation in AF.\nMETHODS: Participants aged 45-64 years were recruited across the United States via an online survey. While answering the survey, they were asked to imagine they were newly diagnosed with AF with a CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure; hypertension; age \u226575 years [doubled]; type 2 diabetes; previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism [doubled]; vascular disease; age 65 to 75 years; and sex category) score of 1 for men and 2 for women. Eligibility criteria included no diagnosis of AF and no prior OAC use. Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: (1) standard text-based information only (n=255), (2) visual aids showing stroke-risk probabilities (n=218), or (3) visual aids plus a values clarification exercise (visual+VC; n=200). Participants were subrandomized within the 2 visual-based groups to view either a gauge display or an icon array representing stroke risk. All participants read a hypothetical scenario of being newly diagnosed with AF and hypertension. The primary outcome was decision confidence as measured by the SURE (Sure of Myself; Understand Information; Risk-Benefit Ratio; Encouragement) test. Secondary measures included participants' perceived stroke risk reduction, worry about stroke or bleeding, and likelihood to choose OAC.\nRESULTS: A total of 673 participants completed the survey. The overall SURE test was 61.2% (156/255) for the standard, 66.5% (145/218) for the visual, and 67% (134/200) for the visual+VC group (visual vs standard P=.23; visual+VC vs standard P=.20). Participants were less likely to choose OAC in the visual groups (standard: mean 58.3, SD 30; visual: mean 51.4, SD 32; visual+VC: 51.9, SD 28; P=.03). Participants felt the reduction in stroke risk from an OAC was less in the visual groups (standard: mean 63.8, SD 22; visual: mean 54.2, SD 28; visual+VC: mean 58.6, SD 25; P<.001). Visualization methods (gauge vs icon array) showed no significant differences in overall SURE test results. Participants were less likely to choose OAC and perceived a smaller stroke risk reduction with gauge than icon array (OAC choice: gauge 48.8, icon array 55.4; P=.03; stroke risk reduction: gauge 52.1, icon array 60.4; P=.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Visual aids can modestly affect decision confidence and perceptions regarding the benefits of OAC but do not significantly alter decision certainty in a scenario where the guidelines do not recommend for or against OAC. Future work should determine the role of a gauge versus icon array visual for decision-making in stroke prevention in AF."

            "abstract": "Patients who had venous thromboembolism (VTE) are not only at increased risk of recurrent VTE but also of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) than the general population. Therefore, the prediction of the risk of these events is important for a tailored prevention and mitigation strategy. We aimed to develop simple scores to estimate recurrent VTE and MACE risks after the discontinuation of anticoagulation in a large cohort of individuals who suffered VTE (EDITH cohort). The primary endpoints were recurrent symptomatic VTE and MACE (composite of non-fatal acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cardiovascular death). Arterial thrombotic event (ATE) exclusively was also considered. Independent predictors of main outcomes were derived from multivariable Cox regression models. Weighted integer points based on the effect estimate of identified predictors were used to derive the final risk scores. A total of 1,999 participants (mean age: 54.78 years, 46.4% male, 43.6% unprovoked VTE) were included in the derivation cohort and 10,000 in the validation cohort (built using bootstrapping). During a median post-anticoagulation follow-up of 6.9 years, recurrent VTE occurred in 29.5% of participants and MACE in 14.8%. Independent predictors of recurrent VTE were male sex, age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, and unprovoked VTE (vs. transient risk factor-associated VTE). Independent predictors of MACE were age >65 years, cancer-associated VTE, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and atrial fibrillation. The risk of recurrent VTE (moderate vs. low: hazard ratio [HR]: 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.06-3.34; high vs. low: HR: 3.78, 95% CI: 2.91-4.89), MACE (moderate vs. low: HR: 6.37, 95% CI: 3.19-12.69; high vs. low: HR: 12.32, 95% CI: 6.09-24.89), and ATE (based on MACE-predict risk score) increased gradually from the lowest to highest of the respective prediction risk score groups. These results were confirmed in the validation cohort with overall reasonable models' discrimination performance (recurrent VTE C-statistic: 0.62-0.63, MACE and ATE C-statistic: 0.72-0.77). Contemporary simple risk scores based on readily available clinical characteristics can reasonably predict the risk of recurrent VTE and MACE after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. These findings may influence the choice of anticoagulation strategy after the acute phase of VTE and, therefore, need confirmation by further studies."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dynamic reassessment of stroke and bleeding risks is a cornerstone of patient-centered care in atrial fibrillation (AF) management. Unlike traditional approaches that evaluate these risks only at diagnosis or at initiation of oral anticoagulation, current evidence emphasizes periodic reassessment due to the evolving nature of risks.\nAREAS COVERED: Stroke and bleeding risks in AF patients are influenced by aging, new comorbidities, and worsening health conditions, requiring updates to management plans to optimize outcomes. Dynamic increases in CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc (or the sex-less CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA) and HAS-BLED scores are associated with heightened risks of stroke and bleeding, underscoring the need for regular reassessment. Addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, renal dysfunction, and concurrent medications is key to improving outcomes. Although several guidelines now recommend risk reassessment at least annually, optimal timing remains unclear. Evidence supports more frequent reassessments for low-risk stroke patients (every 4\u2009months) and high-risk bleeding patients (within 4-6\u2009weeks) to promptly identify changes requiring intervention.\nEXPERT OPINION: Despite its benefits, challenges remain regarding risk reassessment, including the lack of universally applicable intervals and the complexity of multidisciplinary evaluations. Future advancements in artificial intelligence tools are expected to enhance risk reassessment by enabling more precise, personalized, and dynamic patient management."

Moreover, AF has been linked to worse outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Real-world data on the impact of AF on outcomes after TAVI remain limited.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of AF on periprocedural and short-term outcomes after TAVI.\nMETHODS: Patients undergoing TAVI at a tertiary center were consecutively included in a prospective registry. Cardiac rhythm at baseline was assessed using 12-lead ECGs. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at 1 year, stroke at 30 days and 1 year, and procedural success, defined as freedom from periprocedural mortality, surgical re-interventions, re-interventions of the aortic valve, major access site complications, and periprocedural bleedings until discharge.\nRESULTS: Among 1655 patients undergoing TAVI, 428 patients (25.6%) had preexisting AF, and 77 patients (4.6%) were diagnosed with new-onset AF during hospitalization for TAVI. AF was not associated with higher mortality at 30 days (3.7% vs 2.0%; P = .054, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9-3.4]), but at 1 year (13.8% vs 8.4%; P = .001; aHR, 1.6 [95%CI, 1.2-2.2]). The stroke rate was higher in patients with AF at 30 days (5.9% vs 2.7%; P = .003; aHR, 2.1 [95%CI, 1.2-3.5]) and at 1 year (7.1% vs 3.8%; P = .005; aHR, 1.8 [95%CI, 1.2-2.9]). At discharge, 452 patients (89.5%) with AF received oral anticoagulation. After adjusting for anticoagulant therapy, the difference in stroke risk at 30 days (5.7% vs 2.3%; P = .058) and 1 year (6.8% vs 4.2%; P = .165) was no longer significant. Patients with AF experienced more major or life-threatening bleeding complications (14.2% vs 10.6%; P = .043). There were no differences in procedural success between patients with and those without AF (78.8% vs 78.3%; P = .886).\nCONCLUSION: AF was associated with increased mortality at 1 year and higher rates of stroke and major bleeding at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI."

It is commonly used to prevent thrombosis or inhibit the enlargement of existing clots. Rivaroxaban functions as a Factor Xa inhibitor and is indicated for: reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as reducing the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. A robust, precise, and selective reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and validated for analyzing Rivaroxaban in raw materials. Isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min was performed using a Thermo ODS Hypersil C18 column (4.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm, 5\u00a0\u03bcm) at ambient temperature.

However, the unregulated use of anticoagulants in AF remains a concern, as their efficacy and safety profiles are not yet fully understood.\nMETHODS: Data from AF patients were collected in 2013, 2018, and 2023. First, cross-sectional data on AF patients were gathered during each period to longitudinally evaluate long-term trends in AF characteristics and the progression of anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, predictors of non-regulated dosing of oral anticoagulants (OAC) were analyzed. Second, patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) were prospectively followed for 24 and 60 months with different NOAC doses to assess the risk of clinical outcome events and to analyze independent risk factors for clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS: This study included 2825 AF patients, with 394 patients undergoing longitudinal follow-up. Paroxysmal AF (49.70%) and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) (86.30%) were the most prevalent forms with advanced age being a prominent characteristic. Independent predictors of unregulated NOAC use included age, renal insufficiency, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and bleeding risk. At the 24-month follow-up, patients who received overdosed NOAC exhibited a higher mortality rate compared to those who were inappropriately underdosed (18.75 vs.10.92 events/patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.017). At the 60-month follow-up, both all-cause mortality (10.00 vs. 6.49 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.019; 10.00 vs. 6.21 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.005) and the composite endpoint event rate (12.50 vs. 9.61 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.017; 12.50 vs. 9.32 events per patient-year, P\u2009=\u20090.013) were significantly higher in the overdosing group compared to standard and underdosing groups. Age and anemia were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality, while renal insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of composite endpoint events.\nCONCLUSION: AF remains a major disease burden, especially in elderly patients. For Asians, NOAC underdosing was still effective in preventing stroke, but its efficacy and safety need to be further validated through larger-scale clinical trials.

Patients with cancer, particularly those with lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and hematologic malignancies, are at increased risk of AF due to cancer-related hypercoagulability, proinflammatory cytokines, and treatment-related factors. This population faces unique thrombotic and bleeding risks, challenging standard management approaches. Anticoagulation is often complicated by drug-drug interactions with cancer therapies and heightened bleeding risks, including thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) offers an alternative stroke prevention strategy for patients unable to tolerate long-term anticoagulation. By isolating the left atrial appendage, LAAO reduces thromboembolic risk while minimizing bleeding complications. Indications include patients with elevated stroke risk with contraindications to anticoagulation due to nonreversible causes, such as recurrent bleeding or significant drug interactions. Surgical LAAO may also be considered during cardiac surgery in patients with AF and high thromboembolic risk, with previous studies showing reduced risk of thromboembolic complications. Outcomes of LAAO in cancer patients are generally favorable, with studies showing comparable stroke rates, bleeding risks, and mortality to non-cancer populations. However, malignancy-specific complications, such as device-related thrombus, require further investigation. LAAO provides a promising option for stroke prevention in this complex population, but further research is needed to refine patient selection and optimize outcomes."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder with various clinical presentations, including asymptomatic AF, known as silent AF. High-risk patients not treated with anticoagulants are at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, systematic screening has been evaluated to reduce death and cardiovascular complications. Concentrating screening efforts on high-risk populations may optimize the effectiveness of future screening strategies. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of silent AF in a high-risk population 65 years or older with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) or congestive heart failure (CHF).\nMETHODS: A multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study of 645 patients with DM2 or CHF screened for AF in primary care and outpatient clinics in Denmark, Sweden, and Austria from 2016 to 2020. Patients were examined by intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using a handheld ECG device 4 times daily for 2 weeks. AF was diagnosed with at least 1 recording (30 seconds) of AF. Patients with fewer than 40 recordings were excluded from the analyses.\nRESULTS: Overall 3.3 %, 3.0%, and 3.9%, respectively, of the patients with DM2 and CHF, and 5.5% of patients older than 74 years were diagnosed with previously undetected AF.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intermittent handheld ECG screening revealed AF in 1 in every 30 patients in a high-risk population, with an increased observed risk in elderly patients.\nCLINICAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: H-16015331."

Continuous health plan enrollment for\u2009\u2265\u00a012 months before and 12 months after the NVAF diagnosis was required.\nRESULTS: A total of 619,111 patients with NVAF at high risk for stroke were identified, of whom approximately 50% were not treated with OACs. Of the half who received OACs, almost 85% received direct OACs (DOACs) and 15% received warfarin therapy. Overall, the highest untreated rates were observed in the South and West US regions, followed by the Midwest, then the Northeast. The highest DOAC treatment rates were in the Northeast for White patients and in the North and South for Black patients. The highest warfarin treatment rates were in the upper Midwest for White patients and the Midwest for Black patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study may help guide the identification of areas to target interventions to improve treatment rates and confirm prior findings of geographic and racial variations of OAC use in NVAF."

We present a case of a 70-year-old male with a history of AF who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, dizziness, and weight gain five days post-LAAO placement. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Emergency pericardiocentesis drained 800 mL of fluid, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged two days later. Pericardial effusion and tamponade are serious complications of LAAO devices, often presenting with nonspecific symptoms.

The available agents target coagulation factors involved in thrombus formation but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Factor XI plays a minor role in haemostasis but contributes substantially to thrombus expansion, making it an attractive target to mitigate bleeding while maintaining antithrombotic efficacy. Various novel inhibitors, including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, have been developed. Phase II trials in orthopaedic surgery showed dose-dependent reductions in venous thromboembolism without significantly increasing bleeding compared with enoxaparin. In the first phase III trial of a small-molecule inhibitor of activated factor XI in patients with atrial fibrillation, asundexian was associated with a reduction in bleeding but also a higher risk of stroke, compared with apixaban. Factor XI inhibitors appear safe and hold promise for secondary prevention in myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, with ongoing phase III trials assessing their broader efficacy and safety. This Review discusses the rationale, pharmacology, evidence and future directions of factor XI inhibitors across various clinical settings."

It is unknown whether there is an optimal starting day within the 14-day period that balances the risks of recurrent embolic events against serious hemorrhagic events.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if there is an optimal delay time to initiate treatment with a direct oral anticoagulant after atrial fibrillation-related stroke that minimizes the risk of a composite outcome of ischemic or hemorrhagic events.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2, pragmatic, response-adaptive randomized clinical trial was conducted between June 2017 and June 2023 at acute care hospitals in Texas and included patients who had a mild to moderate ischemic stroke (minimum lesion diameter of 1.5 cm) with atrial fibrillation and were prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant within 2 weeks from stroke onset.\nINTERVENTION: Within 3 to 4 days after atrial fibrillation-associated ischemic stroke, patients were randomized to a group for treatment start date (group 1 was day 3 or 4 after stoke onset; group 2 was day 6; group 3 was day 10; and group 4 was day 14) with a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The composite primary outcome was an ischemic (stroke or systemic embolism) or hemorrhagic (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or major systemic hemorrhage) event observed within 30 days from the index stroke time of onset. Posterior probabilities were used to estimate which timing groups were optimal for treatment initiation and were recalculated at predefined intervals. The randomization allocations were adjusted to favor the groups with higher probabilities.\nRESULTS: The trial enrolled and randomized 200 patients (50% were female; the median age was 75 years [IQR, 65-81 years]; 17.5% were Asian, Black, or >1 race; 16.5% were Hispanic; the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 6.5 [IQR, 4-14]; and the median lesion diameter was 3.1 cm [IQR, 2.0-4.4 cm]). No ischemic events were observed for group 1, 3 events were observed for group 2, 2 events were observed for group 3, and 2 events were observed for group 4. One hemorrhagic event was observed for group 1, 1 event was observed for group 2, 1 event was observed for group 3, and 0 events were observed for group 4. Group 1 had a posterior probability of 0.41 for being the optimal day for treatment initiation and it was 0.26 for group 2, 0.17 for group 3, and 0.15 for group 4. The use of response-adaptive randomization was feasible and favored groups with earlier initiation times for use of a direct oral anticoagulant.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A clearly superior day to initiate use of a direct oral anticoagulant for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was not identified, but the evidence suggests that initiating use of a direct oral anticoagulant earlier is better than at later times within the first 2 weeks after stroke onset.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03021928."

This scoping review followed a six-stage framework and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An exhaustive search of four databases identified relevant papers published through August 2024.

Observational studies reported slightly lower mortality rates with DOACs, particularly apixaban, including fewer cardiovascular-related deaths than with VKAs. DOACs, particularly apixaban and rivaroxaban, demonstrate a favorable safety profile compared to warfarin, but show inconsistent evidence in balancing thromboembolic prevention and bleeding risks in patients with AF and CKD stage G5 or on dialysis.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is an effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be known before the stroke (or prevalent AF) or be newly detected after stroke (post-stroke AF). Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of post-stroke AF making inflammatory markers valuable for early detection of post-stroke AF. This study investigated the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory biomarkers in predicting post-stroke AF in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with MT.\nMETHODS: This observational multicentre retrospective cohort study included 849 patients with anterior circulation LVO treated with MT across four centres from 2016 to 2023. Patients were divided into post-stroke AF and NO-AF groups, excluding those with prevalent AF. Baseline demographics, clinical and procedural variables, and inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, were collected at admission and 24 hours post-procedure. Baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability weighting (IPW). Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses assessed the predictive value of CRP for post-stroke AF.\nRESULTS: The study included 849 patients with a median age of 66 years (IQR 54-76) and 477 (56.2%) were female. Post stroke AF was detected in 186 (21.9%) patients while 663 (78.1%) did not experience AF during admission. In the weighted population CRP levels, both admission and 24 hours post-procedure, were higher in post-stroke AF patients. In logistic regression analysis admission and 24-h CRP levels were associated with increased probability of post-stroke AF, respectively (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p<0.001) and (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) following MT. We observed that the model combining age, sex, hypertension, heart failure, alcoholism, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, previous TIA and ischemic stroke and admission CRP (AUC 0.723, 95% CI 0.71-0.74) and 24h CRP (AUC 0.704, 95% CI 0.69-0.72) had good predictive accuracy, with optimal cutoff values of 4.25 for admission CRP and 14.69 for 24-h CRP to detect post-stroke AF. Subgroup analysis indicated CRP predictive relevance, particularly in hypertensive patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest CRP is associated with post-stroke AF in stroke patients due to LVO, highlighting inflammation's role in AF pathogenesis. Measuring CRP at admission and 24 hours may enable early detection and timely anticoagulation. Incorporating CRP into clinical pathways could improve individualized risk assessment, warranting further studies to validate its predictive utility and explore additional markers."

This study examines this relationship to enhance stroke prediction in patients with AF.\nMETHODS: The CABANA trial study from 2009 to 2016 analyzed the relationship between AF load, stroke, and anticoagulation. We matched age, gender, and race, as well as the control and case groups, at 1:4. Non-invasive electrocardiogram monitoring recorded load events and included the total cumulative load in the calculation. Next, we compared the net load between the stroke and control groups, and the relationship between net AF load and stroke was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. This study also explored the interplay between stroke, AF load, and anticoagulation.\nRESULTS: The first independent predictor of ischemic stroke risk is the net AF load (OR\u00a0=\u00a08.72, 95% CI: 3.11-24.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Stratified by the CHA2DS2VASc score, no significant change in net AF load between the high-risk and low-risk groups was observed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.96). Finally, we categorized all patients into adequate and inadequate anticoagulation groups based on whether they received adequate anticoagulation. The net AF load in the adequate anticoagulation group was higher than in the inadequate anticoagulation group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nCONCLUSION: AF burden is significantly associated with the risk of ischemic stroke. Determining the threshold of AF burden can improve stroke prevention strategies, indicating the need for targeted research on risk stratification and management of patients with AF."

Consequently, clinicians face a growing number of patients affected by new-onset AF in the absence of a definite indication for anticoagulation due to several counterarguments: (1) a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score \u2264 1 in otherwise apparently healthy subjects; (2) an uncertain embolic/hemorrhagic benefit/risk ratio with anticoagulation; (3) EKG demonstration and confirmation of AF; and (4) existence of a pathogenic mechanism other than atrial hypercoagulability. In this frustrating limitation of pharmacological options, cardiologists may miss a complete comprehension of drugs with proven anti-ictal potential, whose administration may serve both as a bridge strategy toward future anticoagulation and as a consolidative strategy paralleling anticoagulation. This review aims to summarize and elucidate such therapeutic strategies and their preventative mechanisms."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke prevention in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is challenging and requires a balance between thromboembolic prevention and bleeding. The comparison of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in clinical practice in elderly Asian patients has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in elderly patients with AF in conjunction with data from real-world observational studies.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study conducted in 4 centers in China, where patient information and clinical events were collected through an average of 15 months of follow-up and case queries. Clinical outcomes included major bleeding, minor bleeding, total bleeding, thrombosis, and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 3450 elderly patients with AF were enrolled. 2656 patients were treated with at least 1 NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban), and 794 patients were treated with warfarin. After correcting for confounders, NOACs significantly reduced the risk of minor bleeding [OR 0.70 (95% CL, 0.49-1.01),P\u2009=\u20090.049] and all-cause mortality [OR 0.57( 95% CI, 0.44-0.75),P\u2009<\u20090.001] compared with warfarin, however, major bleeding events [OR 1.51 (95% CL, 0.98-2.42),P\u2009=\u20090.075] and thrombotic events [OR 0.79 (95% CL, 0.57-1.13),P\u2009=\u20090.187] were not significantly different. There was no heterogeneity between clinical outcomes of NOACs and warfarin in subgroup analyses of age (65-74, 75-84, \u2265\u200985 years), sex (male, female), BMI (\u2265\u200925, <\u200925), comorbidities (including hypertension, diabetes and no hypertension, no diabetes), except in female subgroup, where NOACs significantly reduced the risk of minor bleeding [OR 0.56 (95% CL, 0.34-0.91),P\u2009=\u20090.018] and increased the risk of major bleeding [OR 2.28 (95% CL, 1.12-5.14),P\u2009=\u20090.032] compared with warfarin.\nCONCLUSION: Compared with warfarin, NOACs significantly reduced the risk of minor bleeding, all-cause mortality, and there were no statistically significant differences in major bleeding or thrombotic events. NOACs were not more effective than warfarin in thrombotic and bleeding events, regardless of the subgroup analyses on age, male, BMI and comorbid hypertension and diabetes."

After the epicardial ligation of the left atrial appendage (LAA), anticoagulation can be omitted. We present the single-center procedure data and long-term data of octogenarians being treated with LARIAT\u00ae. Method: Out of 145 patients eligible for the epicardial ligation of the LAA, 45 were older than 80 y and included in this analysis. After successful ligation, patients were screened at 6 weeks of follow-up (FUP), at 12 weeks and after 12 months for transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and clinical events. During long-term FUP, TOE sessions and clinical events for embolic events and death were documented. Results: The procedure was successful in 93% of patients, with a mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASC score of 4.6 and HASBLED score of 3.7 and a mean age of 82 y. One major complication occurred, with the laceration of the LAA and surgical closure of the LAA with an Atriclip. The 6-week FUP data were available in 39 patients, with the detection of four leaks (1-3 mm, median 2 mm) and three thrombi; one thrombus occurred at the site of a leak. The 12-week FUP (in 26 patients) showed that three leaks were closed, one leak persisted and one new thrombus developed at the site of the leak. All thrombi were resolved. The 12-month FUP showed the persistent resolution of three thrombi; one thrombus recurred after the withdrawal of the anticoagulant, and no new gap or thrombus could be detected. The long-term FUP (mean 38 months) was documented in 30 patients, with no new gaps and no new thrombi; one patient suffered from a stroke, with a good long-term result of LAA closure in TOE (stroke rate 1%/y, absolute risk reduction of 4.4% to a stroke rate of 5.4% related to the score, relative CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASC risk reduction of 88%). Eleven patients died: four in the first year of ligation and seven during long-term FUP. Conclusions: The epicardial ligation of the LAA for stroke prevention in octogenarians is highly safe and effective. Early TOE FUP is crucial for the detection of thrombi and establishing an optimal anticoagulation regime. No late development of thrombi or gaps can be observed at up to 5 years."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulants (OACs) reduce the risk of stroke.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate if patients with less prior OAC exposure respond differently to a new OAC than patients with more OAC exposure.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prespecified exploratory subgroup analysis of the Oral Factor 11a Inhibitor Asundexian as Novel Antithrombotic-Atrial Fibrillation (OCEANIC-AF) randomized clinical trial, patients enrolled in the OCEANIC-AF trial were categorized as OAC naive or OAC experienced based on whether they had 6 or fewer weeks or more than 6 weeks of prior OAC use. The effect of asundexian vs apixaban was then compared on outcomes among patients who were OAC naive and OAC experienced. The study setting included 1035 sites in 38 countries, and participants were those enrolled in the OCEANIC-AF trial. Data were analyzed from June to July 2024.\nINTERVENTIONS: Asundexian, a novel factor XIa inhibitor, was compared with apixaban in patients with AF.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism. The main safety outcome was major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of patients in the OCEANIC-AF trial, 2493 (17%) were OAC naive (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [8.6] years; 1464 male [59%]) and 12\u202f317 (83%) were OAC experienced (mean [SD] age, 74.2 [7.5] years; 8132 male [66%]). In the asundexian arm, patients who were OAC naive had a stroke or systemic embolism rate of 0.8% (10 of 1238) compared with 1.4% (88 of 6177) in those who were OAC experienced. In the apixaban arm, patients who were OAC naive had a stroke or systemic embolism rate of 0.6% (7 of 1255) compared with 0.3% (19 of 6140) in those who were OAC experienced. Thus, patients who were OAC naive had a smaller increase in stroke or systemic embolism with asundexian compared with apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% CI, 0.54-3.73) than patients who were OAC experienced (HR, 4.66; 95% CI, 2.84-7.65; P for interaction\u2009=.03). Bleeding rates were lower among both OAC-naive patients (0.2% [2 of 1228]) and OAC-experienced patients (0.2% [15 of 6145]) assigned asundexian than among OAC-naive patients (1.0% [13 of 1249]) and OAC-experienced patients (0.7% [40 of 6115]) assigned apixaban.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the OCEANIC-AF randomized clinical trial, patients with AF who were OAC naive had a smaller increase in stroke or systemic embolism and a similar lower rate of bleeding with asundexian compared with apixaban than patients who were OAC experienced. The mechanism of these findings is unknown and deserves further research.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05643573."

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly increasing the risk of thromboembolic events, particularly ischemic stroke. The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the predominant site of thrombus formation in patients with AF, making it a crucial target for stroke prevention strategies. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has emerged as an important therapeutic alternative to oral anticoagulation, particularly in patients with contraindications to long-term anticoagulant therapy. This review examines the role of LAAO in AF management, discussing current indications, patient selection, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. We also explore the latest evidence from major clinical trials and real-world studies, highlighting the efficacy and safety of LAAO compared to standard anticoagulation. Additionally, we consider the unresolved questions and the potential future directions for this intervention, including emerging technologies and the integration of LAAO into broader AF management protocols. Our review underscores the growing importance of LAAO in reducing thromboembolic risk in AF patients, particularly those unable to tolerate traditional anticoagulation, and offers insights into the ongoing evolution of this treatment modality in clinical practice."

            "abstract": "This review highlights the epidemiological and clinical challenge associated with managing patients who have cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and atrial fibrillation. As the population ages, clinicians are increasingly required to devise appropriate management strategies for this specific patient subgroup. These patients face not only the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with oral anticoagulant therapy but also complications due to CAA. CAA is an age-related small vessel disease characterized by the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. This condition progressively weakens the vascular integrity, thereby increasing the risk of major bleeding events. The lack of randomized clinical trials necessitates a multiparametric and multidisciplinary approach to assess the extent of vasculopathy and balance thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, aiming to tailor the most effective management strategy for each patient. In managing such cases, it is crucial to address concomitant risk factors and consider both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as left atrial appendage occlusion, to mitigate the risk of stroke."

Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify NOAF predictors, and propensity-score matching estimated associations between NOAF and in-hospital outcomes. A meta-analysis was also performed by pooling our results with literature data.\nRESULTS: Of 19,288 STEMI patients undergoing PCI, 1.3% (n = 253) experienced NOAF. Independent risk factors were age \u226565 years, history of hypertension, stroke, heart failure, Killip class IV, and right coronary artery as the culprit artery. NOAF was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-4.71), heart failure (HR 4.29, 95% CI 2.81-6.55), cardiogenic shock (HR 4.30, 95% CI 2.28-8.13), in-stent thrombosis (HR 6.04, 95% CI 1.71-21.45), and major bleeding (HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.44-5.66) during hospitalization. Meta-analysis found that NOAF had a higher risk of in-hospital stroke (odds ratio 3.33, 95% CI 1.73-6.43). In-hospital use of anticoagulants was associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality but similar rates of major bleeding in NOAF patients.\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests NOAF following PCI is uncommon but associated with poor in-hospital prognosis. Findings support the use of anticoagulants in these patients during hospitalization."

Short-term outcomes between two different methods of general anesthesia during the procedures were also compared.\nMETHODS: The study included patients who underwent appendage closure between September 2017 and June 2021. Two indications for the procedures, anticoagulant intolerance, and anticoagulant inadequacy were recorded. One-year outcomes were analyzed between groups. Short-term outcomes were compared between the intravenous general anesthesia with high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy and intubated general anesthesia groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 75 consecutive patients were enrolled: 19 patients in the anticoagulant inadequacy group and 56 in the anticoagulant intolerance group. Appendage occlusion was effective in reducing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients with suboptimal pharmacological therapy. There were no significant differences in outcomes between the two indication groups. Appendage closure under high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was found to be feasible and safe, with comparable results to intubated general anesthesia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Appendage occlusion is effective and safe for Taiwan National Health Insurance-approved indications, with no difference between indication groups during 1-year of follow-up.

This was related to several studies that found a higher-than-expected risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism in cardioverted atrial fibrillation/flutter patients. We sought to confirm an elevated rate of stroke, systemic embolism, or death following emergency department cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm compared with similar patients who were not converted.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study combined 4 datasets of atrial fibrillation/flutter patients seen at 25 emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, 2000-2012, who were all eligible for cardioversion. We linked patients to province-wide datasets to determine the primary outcome, a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or all-cause death. To adjust for baseline differences between patients who cardioverted vs those who did not, we used overlap weights based on the propensity score. The latter included 28 variables, including oral anticoagulant prescriptions.\nRESULTS: Of 2521 patients, 2060 (81.7%) converted to sinus rhythm in the emergency department, and 1055 (41.8%) left on anticoagulation. Twelve (0.48%) patients met the primary outcome at 30 days and \u22645 (\u22640.2%) at 7 days. In the weighted sample, at 30 days, the primary outcome occurred in 0.37% (95% CI, 0.04%-0.78%) of cardioverted patients vs 0.23% (95% CI, 0.00%-0.60%) in those not cardioverted; the absolute risk increase was 0.13% (95% CI,\u00a0-0.36% to 0.69%; P\u00a0= .61), and the number needed to harm was\u00a0747.\nCONCLUSION: In atrial fibrillation/flutter patients eligible for cardioversion at 25 emergency departments, the rate of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism and death was very low. After adjusting for risk factors and post-conversion oral anticoagulant use, the rate of subsequent stroke and systemic embolism and death was not significantly higher in patients who cardioverted vs those who did not."

            "abstract": "In elderly patients prone to multiple falls with atrial fibrillation, anticoagulants are often discontinued, primarily due to fear of bleeding. However, even in the presence of repeated falls, the increased risk of stroke associated with discontinuation of anticoagulation significantly outweighs the hemorrhagic risk. The management of fall-prone patients with atrial fibrillation relies on oral anticoagulation along with a systematic assessment of risk factors for bleeding to identify and treat modifiable risk factors. Left atrial appendage closure represents an alternative to anticoagulation that may be considered in cases of irreversible cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and non-modifiable risk factors."

The discrimination of total stroke/SEE was superior for the ABC-AF-stroke score, C-index (0.667 [95%\u00a0CI: 0.648-0.687]), compared with 0.632 (95%\u00a0CI: 0.612-0.652) for the ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) and 0.614 (95%\u00a0CI: 0.594-0.633) for the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (P\u00a0&lt; 0.001 for both).

In patients with either a heightened risk of bleeding precluding enhanced doses of OAC to dissolve the thrombus, or thromboembolism despite optimal OAC, there are limited nonsurgical options.\nOBJECTIVES: To introduce a novel management strategy for resistant LAA thrombus: percutaneous mechanical thrombus aspiration with cerebral protection, followed by LAA closure (LAAC).\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This descriptive, prospective case series of 9 consecutive patients with persistent LAA thrombus was conducted between August 2023 and July 2024 at Mount Sinai Hospital. After placing a cerebral protection device (CPD) when anatomically feasible, balloon atrial septostomy was performed as needed to enhance transeptal access. A 20F mechanical aspiration device with a 15-mm funneled ostium was advanced to the LAA ostium, and manual vacuum aspiration of thrombus was performed. After ultrasonic confirmation of thrombectomy, an LAAC device was implanted.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographic, clinical, and intervention data were collected.\nRESULTS: Nine patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [13.6] years; median [IQR] CHA2DS2-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older, diabetes, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and female sex] score, 5 [2-8] points) presented with LAA thrombus in the context of contraindications to OAC. CPD was placed in 8 patients; one had prohibitive aortic arch anatomy. Given the patient's high thrombotic burden and limited alternatives, the decision was to proceed without CPD, based on a risk-benefit assessment. Balloon atrial septostomy was performed in 8 patients. In 8 patients, complete thrombus removal was achieved, followed by successful LAAC device placement. One patient had a small residual distal thrombus, presumably organized, which was strongly adherent to the LAA myocardium; this was compressed against the wall with the LAAC device. One patient had a small thrombus fragment recovered from the CPD postprocedure. During both the index procedure and during follow-up (range, 4-15 months), there were no complications.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cases series found that temporary cerebral protection, percutaneous mechanical vacuum thrombectomy, and mechanical LAA closure was feasible in patients with persistent LAA thrombus despite optimal OAC. Larger studies will be needed to fully assess the efficacy and safety of this approach."

However, Australian data have shown low uptake of timely anticoagulation, with people in regional areas having a greater risk of low uptake compared to people in metropolitan areas.\nOBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective, mixed methods evaluation of a pharmacist-physician model of care for a rapid access atrial fibrillation (RAAF) clinic in a large regional centre in Victoria, Australia.\nMETHODS: The RAAF clinic involved telehealth pharmacist appointments and face-to-face physician consults and aimed to see patients within 14 days of referral. A retrospective mixed-methods evaluation was adopted. Quantitative methods included time-based analysis of appointment statistics, analyses of the proportion of patients meeting known quality indicators for risk assessment and treatment for AF. Qualitative analysis included conventional content analysis of patient feedback and net promoter scoring to understand patient acceptability.\nRESULTS: There were 312 patients referred to the service during 2022-2023, 274 (88\u00a0%) patients participated in 268 pharmacist and 421 physician appointments. Median days from referral to first clinic consultation were 14 (inter quartile range 9-20). Proportion of high-risk patients (CHADSVA >1) who received anticoagulation for stroke prevention increased from 88\u00a0% pre-clinic to 97\u00a0% post-clinic. Anti-arrhythmic therapies were used by 76\u00a0% of patient's pre-clinic and 73\u00a0% post-clinic, with changes to therapy occurring in 35\u00a0% of patients. Patients were highly accepting of the service, with a mean patient acceptability score of 9 out of 10. Qualitative analysis illustrated that positive patient experience was linked to clinician performance, as well as the organisational structure and workflow of the clinic itself.\nCONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-physician model of care was successfully implemented in a regional health setting, leading to improved access and medication management, with high levels of patient acceptance."

Anticoagulated patients with NVAF and atrial thrombus identified by transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac computed tomography angiography were consecutively enrolled. All patients received follow-up imaging within 6 months to assess the resolution of atrial thrombus. The primary endpoint was the resolution of atrial thrombus and the secondary endpoint was the occurrence of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and all-cause death during the follow-up period.ResultsAmong 8987 patients with NVAF scheduled for catheter ablation or cardioversion, 70 anticoagulated patients with atrial thrombus were final analyzed. The average age was 61.8\u00b110.6 years, 62.9% of them were men, and 32 (45.7%) patients presented with HF. Within the 6-month follow-up period, atrial thrombus resolution was observed in 47 (67.1%) patients. The rate of atrial thrombus resolution was lower in patients with baseline HF (50.0% vs 81.6%). In the adjusted logistic regression analysis model, HF was independently associated with the non-resolution of atrial thrombus (adjusted OR: 5.38, 95% CI: 1.19-24.27).

Consensus is lacking regarding optimal stroke prevention management after surgical LAA management.\nOBJECTIVE: To elucidate real world clinical management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgical LAA management.\nMETHODS: Over a 7-year period at a single center, 458 participants carried a diagnosis of AF and underwent surgical exclusion of their LAA during concomitant cardiac surgery. Follow-up was catalogued via retrospective chart review; median follow-up was 2 years. Successful LAA ligation was defined as maximal stump depth\u2009<\u20091.0\u00a0cm by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without distal leak.\nRESULTS: Among 458 patients, 299 were discharged on OAC (142 DOAC and 157 warfarin).

            "abstract": "Background: The REGUEIFA registry aims to assess the contemporary treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the community health area of Galicia. Due to the prognostic relevance of anticoagulation status, we used it to differentiate patients by adding a category to the stroke domain of the 4S-AF score. Methods: A Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify the prognostic value of the modified 4S-AF score regarding mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and thromboembolic events. For bleeding events, we used a Poisson regression model to account for recurrent events. Results: When considering the stroke risk domain as a categorical variable, the risk stratification for all-cause mortality improved by more than 2 times (stroke risk: 2 vs. 1; hazard ratio (HR): 2.17; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-4.55), p = 0.04). According to the Poisson regression model, the stroke risk domain was also an independent factor for hemorrhagic events (HR: 2.83; 95% CI 1.69-4.74, p &lt; 0.001). For patients with permanent AF, the mortality rate was more than 2 times higher than that of patients with paroxysmal AF or their first episode of AF (HR: 2.53; 95% CI; 1.53-4.18); p &lt; 0.001. Anticoagulation therapy was the only independent domain treatment associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.41; 95% CI 0.19-0.89 p &lt; 0.0023). Conclusions: The modification of the stroke risk score to reflect anticoagulation status may improve the characterization and stratification of overall mortality risk, as demonstrated in the contemporary AF cohort from the REGUEIFA study. The permanent form of AF was associated with a higher risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality."

It is the first cause of ischemic stroke. These are largely preventable if AF is diagnosed. It is essential to estimate the patient's embolic risk using the CHA2DS2-VA score, which now replaces the CHADS-Vasc score. Patients who require it must receive adequate anticoagulant treatment. New technologies (in particular, smart-watch) have led to advances in the detection and diagnosis of this arrhythmia. Patients suffering from AF may be treated with a heart rate control strategy (to limit tachycardia) or a rhythm control strategy (to maintain sinus rhythm). Catheter ablation is increasingly being offered to patients as an alternative to antiarrhythmic therapy. Controlling risk factors is essential to prevent the onset of AF, and to try to maintain sinus rhythm over the long term."

Originally developed and validated in predominantly European populations, it may not accurately reflect the stroke risk for diverse ethnic groups; in Aotearoa New Zealand, M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples with AF are at higher stroke risk. As part of global efforts to address health inequities, there is growing interest in adapting predictive models to suit local- and ethnic-specific risks better. Our objectives were to determine: 1) if stroke risk from AF varies by ethnic background/race, 2) stroke rates in non-anticoagulated AF cohorts, and 3) model performance of CHA2DS2 VASc across different geographical regions. Finally, we provide an overview of methodological considerations for risk model development.\nMETHODS: We searched English language peer-reviewed studies reporting stroke rates in unselected cohorts with AF, published between 1995 and 2024. For stroke risk, we included cohorts with over 5,000 non-anticoagulated patients. The sources of evidence were PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE.\nRESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion. We found significantly elevated stroke risk in African Americans and Hispanics with AF compared with whites (odds ratio [OR] 1.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.66] and OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.05-1.18] respectively). In M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples with AF, the risk of stroke was higher than in New Zealand Europeans, but this difference was not significant (OR 1.28 [95% CI 0.89-1.82], p=0.18 and OR 1.29 [95% CI 0.93-1.52], p=0.17 respectively). Stroke risk (0.6/100-6.8/100 person-years) and CHA2DS2 VASc performance (c-statistics 0.55-0.8) varied substantially between studies.\nCONCLUSION: We support the local refinement of risk prediction models in line with cardiology society recommendations."

The Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the predictive value of the inflammation biomarkers for stroke and all-cause mortality, the c-statistic, Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI), and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) were calculated. Lymphocyte Monocyte Ratio (LMR) was the most informative biomarker for predicting stroke, and adding LMR to the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score did not improve its predictive ability for stroke, but it did improve its reclassification ability. Similar results were observed when comparing LMR+ CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score with the ABC stroke score. For all-cause mortality, a Systemic Inflammation Score (SIS) score was calculated using ALB, fibrinogen and LMR, and adding SIS to the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score showed a significant improvement in its predictive ability and reclassification ability.

            "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases and a complicating comorbidity for multiple associated diseases. Many clinical decisions regarding AF are currently based on the binary recognition of AF being present or absent with the categorical appraisal of AF as continued or intermittent. Assessment of AF in clinical trials is largely limited to the time to (first) detection of an AF episode. Substantial evidence shows, however, that the quantitative characteristic of intermittent AF has a relevant impact on symptoms, onset, and progression of AF and AF-related outcomes, including mortality. Atrial fibrillation burden is increasingly recognized as a suitable quantitative measure of intermittent AF that provides an estimate of risk attributable to AF, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatment, and the need for oral anticoagulation. However, the diversity of assessment methods and the lack of a consistent definition of AF burden prevent a wider clinical applicability and validation of actionable thresholds of AF burden. To facilitate progress in this field, the AF burden Consensus Group, an international and multidisciplinary collaboration, proposes a unified definition of AF burden. Based on current evidence and using a modified Delphi technique, consensus statements were attained on the four main areas describing AF burden: Defining the characteristics of AF burden, the recording principles, the clinical relevance in major clinical conditions, and implementation as an outcome in the clinic and in clinical trials. According to this consensus, AF burden is defined as the proportion of time spent in AF expressed as a percentage of the recording time, undertaken during a specified monitoring duration. A pivotal requirement for validity and comparability of AF burden assessment is a continuous or near-continuous duration of monitoring that needs to be reported together with the AF burden assessment. This proposed unified definition of AF burden applies independent of comorbidities and outcomes. However, the disease-specific actionable thresholds of AF burden need to be defined according to the targeted clinical outcomes in specific populations. The duration of the longest episode of uninterrupted AF expressed as a time duration should also be reported when appropriate. A unified definition of AF burden will allow for comparability of clinical study data to expand evidence and to establish actionable thresholds of AF burden in various clinical conditions. This proposed definition of AF burden will support risk evaluation and clinical treatment decisions in AF-related disease. It will further promote the development of clinical trials studying the clinical relevance of intermittent AF. A unified approach on AF burden will finally inform the technology development of heart rhythm monitoring towards validated technology to meet clinical needs."

            "abstract": "Finerenone is a new mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that does not have a steroid skeleton, and in two large-scale clinical studies targeting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated with type 2 diabetes (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD), it significantly reduced the composite endpoints due to the progression of renal disease, and the composite endpoints of cardiovascular disease. Recently, we published two databases summarizing how finerenone is used in clinical practice in Japan (FINEROD). In this paper, we examines how best to use finerenone to get the most out of its effects. The most important side effect of finerenone is hyperkalemia, and the risk of hyperkalemia increases as renal function declines. By starting treatment early when eGFR is maintained, it is expected that side effects will be reduced. Furthermore, the FIDELITY analysis (a pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD) has shown that the clinical effect is stronger when finerenone treatment is started at an early stage of CKD. The simultaneous use of RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitor or ARB), finerenone, and SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be a promising treatment. Further, it is important to continue the medications of RAS inhibitors and MR antagonists as long as possible. To prevent hyperkalemia, the most reliable and safest method is to use a new oral potassium adsorbent. It is important to think of a new oral potassium adsorbent not as something that will lower serum potassium levels, but as something that will allow you to avoid discontinuing or increase the dose of RAS inhibitors or MR antagonists. Differences between steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists. Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are present in epithelial tissues such as renal tubules and intestinal epithelium, as well as in non-epithelial tissues such as the brain, heart, and blood vessel walls. Although the MR itself is exactly the same in both tissues, its physiological actions are completely different. In epithelial tissues, cortisol is inactivated by the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 \u03b2-HSD2), and aldosterone selectively binds to the MR. On the other hand, in non-epithelial tissues, 11 \u03b2-HSD2 is almost nonexistent or is only weakly active, so that cortisol, which outnumbers it, binds to almost all the MR, and aldosterone binds to the very few remaining MR. Spironolactone, a representative MR antagonist with a steroid skeleton, has a high affinity for renal tubules, and concentrates there, where it is highly effective. Therefore, it is classified as a potassium-sparing diuretic. However, if it does not have a steroid skeleton, its affinity for epithelial and non-epithelial tissues is equal. In other words, its effect on epithelial tissues is relatively weak, and its effect on non-epithelial tissues is relatively strong. Finerenone does not cross the blood-brain barrier\u00a0(BBB), and does not reach the central nervous system. The central MR, especially the periventricular MR, is strongly involved in hypertension, and esaxerenone, another nonsteroidal MR antagonist, which can cross the BBB although only to a small extent and reach the central nervous system, has a strong antihypertensive effect."

A comprehensive search adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted across five databases, identifying eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the last five years. The included studies examined diverse populations, ranging from pediatric to elderly CKD patients, with interventions tailored to specific subgroups, including those with proteinuria or diabetic kidney disease. Key outcomes assessed included changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria reduction, cardiovascular events, and treatment-related adverse effects. Findings highlighted the superiority of ACEis and ARBs in reducing proteinuria and slowing CKD progression, particularly in proteinuric patients, while CCBs were effective in blood pressure control and improving cardiovascular parameters. However, no head-to-head trials directly comparing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (ACEis/ARBs) and CCBs were identified, limiting definitive conclusions regarding their relative efficacy. Limitations such as small sample sizes and short follow-up durations were also noted in some studies. This review underscores the importance of individualized therapy based on patient-specific factors to optimize renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Further research is recommended to explore long-term outcomes and combination therapies in this population."

Cardiovascular complications are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finerenone is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Research has shown that finerenone provides renal, cardiac, and retinal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes. Currently, various drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors) are effective in treating diabetic vascular complications, but each has its limitations. Combining finerenone with RAS Inhibitors/SGLT-2i may yield better clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS: This review aggregates research on the mechanisms and clinical efficacy of finerenone, RAS Inhibitors, and SGLT-2i used individually, as well as in combination, for the treatment of vascular complications in diabetes from various databases.\nRESULTS: This review shows that combining finerenone with RAS inhibitors/ SGLT-2 inhibitors can further reduce proteinuria, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and the risk of hyperkalemia, slow CKD progression, reduce atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertrophy, and lower the incidence of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. It can also reduce retinal neovascularization, macular edema, and inflammation. Overall, combining can further lower the risk of complications in type 2 diabetic patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, combining finerenone with RAS inhibitors and SGLT-2i is a promising treatment strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms and interactions are not fully understood, necessitating more basic research and clinical trials to provide evidence. Combining finerenone with existing treatments may yield better clinical outcomes."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with loss of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria/proteinuria is a known long-term complication of GSD I that has become less frequent with improvement of therapy over the last decades. We retrospectively investigated a cohort of 63 GSD I patients (51 GSD Ia, 12 GSD Ib, mostly adults) with a mean age of 27.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0years. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of renal function, metabolic parameters, co-morbidities and medication at the time of last-follow-up. Our study shows that renal complications have become less common since standardized diet and renoprotective medications are available. CKD was only evident above the age of 25\u00a0years in our cohort and the decline in glomerular filtration rate was moderate. No patient required renal replacement therapy. Renal calcifications and kidney stones were no frequent complications. Insufficient metabolic control was a potential risk factor for proteinuria. Supportive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is not regularly used in patients suffering from (micro-) albuminuria. This study reveals that with adherence to a standardized diet and renoprotective medication, renal complications in GSD I occur later and are less severe. However, renal involvement occurs at a similar frequency to GSD cohorts studied about 20\u00a0years earlier. Since micro-albuminuria in GSD increases the risk of progression of renal disease to kidney failure, a thorough characterization of larger GSD cohorts and a better understanding of underlying pathomechanisms are needed to minimize kidney involvement in GSD I."

            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a high risk of heart disease and end-stage kidney disease. This review describes how new medications, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASi), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), can lower heart-kidney risk in people with CKD. GLP1RA are already recommended for managing blood sugar in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes and have been shown to lower the risk of developing end-stage kidney disease. GLP1RA will likely soon be included in clinical guidelines, but further research is needed to understand how these medications protect the kidneys. ASi are another new medication that lower the protein found in urine. Larger trials are being done to see how well these medications work in slowing CKD. Lastly, both sGC agonists and ERAs have been shown to relax blood vessels to improve blood flow in the kidney, and reduce the amount of protein found in urine, both of which are critical to protecting kidneys. Larger clinical trials are being done to see if these medications prevent CKD from getting worse. In summary, this review describes the new and promising treatments for CKD. These therapies hold the potential to slow kidney disease and improve the wellbeing of patients. Further research of these new treatments is important for improving CKD care.\nABSTRACT: Despite recent advancements in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), identifying novel therapies beyond guideline-directed therapies that reduce residual cardiorenal risk remains imperative. In this review, we highlight the clinical evidence supporting emerging therapies for CKD, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and other incretin-based therapies, aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASI), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) agonists and anti-inflammatory drugs. Long-acting GLP1RA are already recommended for glycemic control in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes and the large, dedicated kidney outcome trial FLOW was recently stopped early for efficacy. Emerging clinical trial evidence supports the concept that ASI also provide additional benefit on top of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, which remain a cornerstone of CKD treatment. Next, we consider the use of sGC agonists, which target nitric oxide bioavailability and thereby reduce albuminuria. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential of ERA, which act through hemodynamic and anti-fibrotic mechanisms, thereby addressing a common final pathway in the development of CKD. Accordingly, our review highlights the changing therapeutic landscape for CKD with promising agents to further prevent the progression of kidney disease."

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern around the world. It is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and, as it progresses, the risk of cardiovascular events increases. Furthermore, end-stage kidney disease severely affects life expectancy and quality of life. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are not only primary causes of CKD but also independent risk factors for CVD, which underscores the importance of effective treatment strategies for these conditions. The current therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, are administered to control hypertension, slow the progression of CKD, and reduce cardiovascular risk. However, their efficacy remains suboptimal in certain instances. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a nuclear receptor found in various tissues, such as the kidney and heart, plays a pivotal role in the progression of CKD. Overactivation of MR triggers inflammation and fibrosis, which exacerbates kidney damage and accelerates disease progression. MR antagonists (MRAs) have substantial beneficial effects in patients with cardiac and renal conditions; however, their use has been constrained because of adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia and kidney dysfunction. Recently, novel non-steroidal MRAs are more efficacious and have superior safety profiles to steroidal MRAs, making them promising potential components of future treatment strategies. Here, we discuss recent findings and the roles of MRAs in the management of hypertension and CKD, with a focus on the evidence obtained from fundamental research and major clinical trials."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the world. However, the current conventional approaches have not yet achieved satisfactory efficacy. As one of the most influential products in botanical medicine, Ginkgo biloba L. leaves extract (GBE) demonstrates various pharmacological effects on DKD and is gradually used as an adjunctive therapy for this disease. A comprehensive analysis is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GBE as an adjuvant treatment for DKD.\nOBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GBE as a supplementary treatment to conventional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for DKD patients, providing a reference for subsequent research and clinical practice.\nMETHODS: This study has been registered in PROSPERO as CRD42023455792. Ten databases were searched from their inception to 21 July 2023. Randomized controlled trials about GBE and DKD were included. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 16.0 were employed to conduct the analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed through the \u03c72 test and the I2 test, and the effect model was chosen accordingly. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity and the influence of different factor levels on efficacy. The publication bias was evaluated with the funnel plot and Egger's test, and the evidence quality was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method.\nRESULTS: A total of 41 studies with 3,269 patients were finally enrolled in this study. None of the included studies reported whether renal or cardiovascular disease progression events occurred. Compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) alone, the combination with GBE was more beneficial in improving urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) [mean difference (MD) = -22.99\u00a0\u03bcg/min, 95% confidence interval (CI): -27.66 to -18.31, p &lt; 0.01], serum creatinine (SCr) [MD = -8.30\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, 95% CI: -11.55 to -5.05, p &lt; 0.01], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [MD = -0.77\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.49, p &lt; 0.01], 24-hour urinary total protein (24hUTP) [MD = -0.28\u00a0g/d, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.22, p &lt; 0.01], cystatin C (Cys-C) [MD = -0.30\u00a0mg/L, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.17, p &lt; 0.01], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -0.69\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.38, p &lt; 0.01], triglyceride (TG) [MD = -0.40\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.23, p &lt; 0.01], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [MD = -0.97\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -1.28 to -0.65, p &lt; 0.01], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [MD = -0.30\u00a0mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.05, p = 0.02], hematocrit [MD = -4.58%, 95% CI: -5.25 to -3.90, p &lt; 0.01] and fibrinogen [MD = -0.80\u00a0g/L, 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.47, p &lt; 0.01]. No significant improvement was found in 2-hour postprandial glucose (2hPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). No significant difference was detected in adverse events.\nCONCLUSION: Combining GBE with ACEI/ARB may improve UAER, SCr, BUN, 24hUTP, Cys-C, TC, TG, LDL-C, hematocrit and fibrinogen in DKD patients. It also seems beneficial for oxidative stress and inflammation but has minimal impact on glucose and blood pressure. Combined GBE therapy is generally tolerated, but safety monitoring remains essential during its use. More long-term high-quality clinical studies and in-depth molecular research are still necessary to provide stronger evidence regarding the benefits and safety of GBE in DKD.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=455792, identifier CRD42023455792."

This review aims to explore the epidemiology, cardiovascular complications, and management strategies associated with CKD, emphasizing the importance of preventing cardiovascular disease and early intervention. CKD is primarily driven by conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, which often coexist and exacerbate renal impairment. Effective management requires a multifaceted approach, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and regular monitoring. Dietary changes, such as sodium restriction and a controlled intake of phosphorus and potassium, play a vital role in preserving renal function. Pharmacological therapies, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and emerging agents like SGLT2 inhibitors, have shown efficacy in slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, patients undergoing dialysis face increased cardiovascular risk, necessitating comprehensive management strategies to address both renal and cardiac health. As the landscape of CKD treatment evolves, ongoing research into novel therapeutic options and personalized medical approaches are essential.

Affecting around 40% of diabetic patients, DKD poses substantial economic burdens due to its prevalence worldwide. The primary clinical features of DKD include the leakage of proteins into the urine, altered glomerular filtration, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Current treatments focus on managing hypertension and hyperglycemia to slow the progression of DKD. These include the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to control blood sugar and ACE inhibitors to reduce blood pressure. Despite these measures, current treatments do not cure DKD and fail to address its underlying causes. Emerging research highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a pivotal factor in DKD progression. The kidneys' high energy requirements make them particularly susceptible to disturbances in mitochondrial function. In DKD, mitochondrial damage leads to reduced energy production and increased oxidative stress, exacerbating tissue damage. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage is a key aspect of this dysfunction, with studies suggesting that changes in mtDNA copy number can serve as biomarkers for the progression of the disease. Efforts to target mitochondrial dysfunction are gaining traction as a potential therapeutic strategy. This includes promoting mitochondrial health through pharmacological and lifestyle interventions aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. Such approaches could lead to more effective treatments that directly address the DKD."

ACEIs and ARBs are essential drugs for nephroprotection: they reduce blood pressure values and albuminuria, both related to cardiovascular damage and CKD progression. The nephroprotective effects are evident in both diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic renal disease, and the initial eGFR fall, if not more than 30%, should be considered as a marker of long-term success of renal protection. To optimize the RAAS inhibition salt intake should be strictly controlled, moreover the effective antiproteinuric dose can often be higher than that used as an antihypertensive. In selected and closely monitored cases, it is also possible to consider dual RAAS blockade. Finally, it should be noted that in patients with advanced CKD RAAS inhibition should not be discontinued, either because it does not give any benefit on GFR or because it increases cardiovascular risk."

To detect renal disease in individuals with diabetes, screening typically involves evaluating the glomerular filtration rate and measuring albuminuria. Although there are established guidelines for these screenings, adherence to them varies. This study aims to examine the prevalence of albuminuria screening among adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) and to assess the different practices in managing these patients across primary and tertiary care settings. Methods This cross-sectional observational study involved adult patients with DM attending outpatient clinics in both primary and tertiary care settings. Patient data were gathered using a standardized form, excluding those with established chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were under nephrology care. Results The study included 1,010 patients, with 303 (30%) from primary care clinics and 707 (70%) from tertiary care clinics. The cohort comprised 582 (58%) females, with a median age of 62 years (IQR: 55-70), and approximately 990 (98%) had type 2 DM (T2DM). Annual albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) screening was conducted for 498 out of 1,010 patients (49%) (95% confidence interval {CI}: 46%-52%). Screening compliance was notably higher in primary care settings compared to tertiary care clinics. Older patients (over 60 years) and those with hypertension or cardiac conditions were less likely to undergo screening. Among those screened, 185 of 498 patients (37%) (95% CI: 33%-41%) had abnormal albuminuria (ACR > 3). Conclusion Albuminuria is a significant indicator of progressing renal disease and cardiovascular risk. The annual screening rate for albuminuria in diabetic patients is inadequate. Primary care physicians show better adherence to screening guidelines compared to their tertiary care counterparts. Increasing physician awareness about the importance of screening could improve guideline compliance and mitigate the adverse effects of albuminuria."

As the global prevalence of diabetes has increased, DKD has become highly prevalent and a leading cause of kidney failure, accelerated cardiovascular disease, premature mortality and global health care expenditure. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to DKD, and single lifestyle or pharmacological interventions have shown limited efficacy at preserving kidney function. For nearly two decades, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were the only available kidney-protective drugs. However, several new drug classes, including sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist and a selective endothelin receptor antagonist, have now been demonstrated to improve kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, emerging preclinical and clinical evidence of the kidney-protective effects of glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists has led to the prospective testing of these agents for DKD. Research and clinical efforts are geared towards using therapies with potentially complementary efficacy in combination to safely halt kidney disease progression. As more kidney-protective drugs become available, the outlook for people living with DKD should improve in the next few decades."

The utility of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the management of lupus nephritis is currently uncertain. Here, we summarize the rationale for their use among patient with lupus nephritis.\nRECENT FINDINGS: SGLT2 inhibitors were initially developed as antihyperglycemic agents. They have since been shown to have additional, profound effects to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and lessen the long-term risks of cardiovascular disease in large clinic trials of patients with chronic kidney disease, with and without diabetes, as well as in patients with and without proteinuria. Patients with recent exposure to immunosuppression were excluded from these trials due to concern for risk of infection. In the few, small trials of patients with lupus nephritis, SGLT2 inhibitors were found to be well tolerated. They have been shown to reduce proteinuria and to have modest beneficial effects on blood pressure and BMI among patients with lupus nephritis. They have not been shown to influence disease activity.\nSUMMARY: SGLT2 inhibitors may have a role in mitigating the chronic renal and cardiovascular effects of lupus nephritis. They should be introduced after kidney function has been stabilized with appropriate immunosuppression, in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. They currently have no role in active disease."

However, hyperkalemia is a common and serious adverse effect associated with using RAASi.\nKEY MESSAGES: It is imperative to establish personalized management strategies to enable patients to continue RAASi therapy while effectively addressing hyperkalemia risk. Healthcare professionals must be careful not to inadvertently create a low renal perfusion state, which can reduce distal nephron luminal flow or luminal sodium concentration while using RAASi. Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs), such as finerenone, are demonstrated to delay CKD progression and reduce CV complications, all while mitigating the risk of hyperkalemia. Additionally, maintaining a routine monitoring regimen for serum potassium levels among at-risk patients, making dietary adjustments, and considering the adoption of newer potassium-binding agents hold promise for optimizing RAASi therapy and achieving more effective hyperkalemia management."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Proteinuria is a modifiable risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in children. Finerenone, a selective, non-steroidal, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) has been approved to treat adults with CKD associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) following results from the phase III clinical trials FIDELIO-DKD (NCT02540993) and FIGARO-DKD (NCT02545049). In a pre-specified pooled analysis of both studies (N\u2009=\u200913,026), finerenone was shown to have an acceptable safety profile and was efficacious in decreasing the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes and of proteinuria.\nOBJECTIVE: FIONA and the associated open-label extension (OLE) study aim to demonstrate that combining finerenone with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in sustainably reducing urinary protein excretion in children with CKD and proteinuria.\nDESIGN: FIONA (NCT05196035; Eudra-CT: 2021-002071-19) is a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III study of 6\u00a0months' duration in approximately 219 pediatric patients. Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of CKD (an eGFR\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0mL/min/1.73 m2 if\u2009\u2265\u20091 to\u2009&lt;\u200918 years or a serum creatinine level\u2009\u2264\u20090.40 mg/dL for infants 6 months to\u2009&lt;\u20091 year) with significant proteinuria despite ACEi or ARB usage. The primary objective is to demonstrate that finerenone, added to an ACEi or ARB, is superior to placebo in reducing urinary protein excretion. FIONA OLE (NCT05457283; Eudra-CT: 2021-002905-89) is a single-arm, open-label study, enrolling participants who have completed FIONA. The primary objective of FIONA OLE is to provide long-term safety data. FIONA has two primary endpoints: urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) reduction of\u2009\u2265\u200930% from baseline to day 180 and percent change in UPCR from baseline to day 180. A sample size of 198 participants (aged 2 to\u2009&lt;\u200918\u00a0years) in FIONA will provide at least 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of either of the two primary endpoints.\nCONCLUSION: FIONA is evaluating the use of finerenone in children with CKD and proteinuria. Should safety, tolerability, and efficacy be demonstrated, finerenone could become a useful additional therapeutic agent in managing proteinuria and improving kidney outcomes in children with CKD.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05196035.

The primary outcome of our study is to evaluate the impact of RAAS blockers in CKD progression in elderly patients without proteinuria.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicenter open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial including patients over 65 year-old with hypertension and CKD stages 3-4 without proteinuria. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive RAAS blockers or other antihypertensive drugs and were followed up for three years. Primary outcome is estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline at 3 years.

Primarilymineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (spironolactone and eplerenone), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were used for the treatment of CKD, but due to the high risk of hyperkalaemia, the combination was infrequently used. Currently after approval by FDA in 2021, finerenone was found to be effective in the treatment of CKD. Finerenone slowdowns the progression of diabetic nephropathy and lessens the cardiovascular morbidity in DN patients.\nOBJECTIVE: The main objective of this review article is to provide a comprehensive and insightful overview of the role of finerenone by mainly focusing on its pharmacological properties, toxicity, uses, bioanalytical technique used for determination, and treatment options.\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: Finerenone works by inhibiting the action of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Finerenone is quickly absorbed from the digestive tract after oral treatment and achieves peak plasma concentrations in 1-2 hours.\nRESULT: Finerenone is actively metabolized through oxidation, epoxidation substitution, and direct hydroxylation. Elimination of finerenone is done through urine and feces. Determination of finerenone can be done through HPLC-MS and LSC.\nCONCLUSION: The present review covers the complete picture of ADME properties, bioanalytical techniques, clinical trials, toxicity, and possible avenues in this arena. Finerenone is effective compared to other mineralocorticoid receptor-like spironolactone and eplerenone, for the treatment of chronic kidney disease."

Screening may be considered for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age 60 years and older, family history of kidney disease, previous acute kidney injury, or preeclampsia. Diagnosis and staging of CKD are based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), excessive urinary albumin excretion, or evidence of kidney parenchymal damage lasting more than three months. eGFR should be determined using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without the race variable. Risk calculators are available to estimate the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. When possible, serum cystatin C should be measured to confirm eGFR in patients with CKD. Blood pressure should be maintained at less than 140/90 mm Hg, with a systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg or less for patients tolerant of therapy, using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and metformin should be considered in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who have not reached their glycemic goal. Intravenous iodinated contrast media temporarily reduces eGFR and should be avoided in patients with advanced CKD. Interdisciplinary management of patients with CKD is important for reducing morbidity and mortality, and patients at high risk of progression to end-stage renal disease should be referred to a nephrologist."

We compared their individual and combined efficacy and safety in patients with non-diabetic CKD.\nMETHODS: In an open-label, randomized clinical trial, we included patients aged 18-80 on maximal tolerated ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker with eGFR 25-45\u00a0mL/min/1,73\u00a0m2 and albuminuria 150-2000\u00a0mg/g. Participants received either finerenone 20\u00a0mg/day or dapagliflozin 10\u00a0mg/day for four weeks, followed by combination therapy for four weeks.

In total, 1100 patients with type 2 DM with a follow-up duration > 1 year were included in this longitudinal study. The risk of CKD progression was assessed according to GNRI quartiles. Patients in the lowest GNRI quartile exhibited a significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), compared with those in quartile four. Moreover, these patients had poorer glycemic control and lower hemoglobin levels, body mass index, and albumin levels. Additionally, they exhibited a greater annual decline in eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that old age (>60 years), baseline eGFR, the presence of proteinuria, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and low GNRI were significantly associated with CKD progression. GNRI may serve as a valuable predictive tool for identifying the risk of adverse renal outcomes in patients with type 2 DM. It may potentially serve as a more feasible measure for assessing the nutritional status of these patients, as well as for predicting their clinical outcomes."

According to the concept of cardio-renal and reno-cardiac syndromes, most patients with CKD are affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CVD (including HF) is one of the factors not only promoting progression of established CKD but also triggering its onset and development. Treatment of CVD and HF in CKD patients remains challenging since CKD patients are characterized by extremely diverse and strongly expressed risk profiles, and the data from well-designed clinical trials addressing this population are scarce. Nevertheless, it seems that most of the drugs used in the treatment of CVD and HF (including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, mineralocorticosteroid receptor antagonists, and sacubitril/valsartan) are of similar efficacy in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranging between 45 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (although higher prevalence of side effects may limit their use). The data on cardiovascular (CV) drug efficacy in patients with lower GFR values (i.e. below 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) remain limited. In this review, we focused on the efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in the treatment of CVD and HF in CKD patients with or without diabetes. SGLT2i are clearly cardioprotective in a wide spectrum of estimated GFR although the data for HF patients with respect to urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are scarce, and for those with significantly reduced estimated GFR are still not available or not convincing, even after completion of large-scale high-quality major cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or trials with flozins in CKD and HF."

Current clinical tools cannot predict whether or not patients will respond to treatment with RAS inhibitors (RASi). We aimed to investigate whether proteome analysis could identify urinary peptides as biomarkers that could predict the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blockers treatment to avoid DKD progression. Furthermore, we investigated the comparability of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using four different GFR equations, for DKD progression.\nMETHODS: We evaluated urine samples from a discovery cohort of 199 diabetic patients treated with RASi. DKD progression was defined based on eGFR percentage slope results between visits (\u223c1 year) and for the entire period (\u223c3 years) based on the eGFR values of each GFR equation. Urine samples were analysed using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed between the uncontrolled (patients who did not respond to RASi treatment) and controlled kidney function groups (patients who responded to the RASi treatment). Peptides were combined in a support vector machine-based model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the risk prediction models in two independent validation cohorts treated with RASi.\nRESULTS: The classification of patients into uncontrolled and controlled kidney function varies depending on the GFR equation used, despite the same sample set. We identified 227 peptides showing nominal significant difference and consistent fold changes between uncontrolled and controlled patients in at least three methods of eGFR calculation. These included fragments of collagens, alpha-1-antitrypsin, antithrombin-III, CD99 antigen and uromodulin. A model based on 189 of 227 peptides (DKDp189) showed a significant prediction of non-response to the treatment/DKD progression in two independent cohorts.\nCONCLUSIONS: The DKDp189 model demonstrates potential as a predictive tool for guiding treatment with RASi in diabetic patients."

To examine this issue, we carried out targeted metabolomics profiling in a mouse model of DN that develops kidney disease resembling the human disorder. We found a distinct profile of increased lactate levels and impaired energy metabolism in kidneys of mice with DN, and treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) reduced albuminuria, attenuated kidney pathology and corrected many metabolic abnormalities, restoring levels of lactate toward normal while increasing kidney ATP content. We also found enhanced expression of lactate dehydrogenase isoforms in DN. Expression of both the LdhA and LdhB isoforms were significantly increased in kidneys of mice, and treatment with ARB significantly reduced their expression. Single-cell sequencing studies showed specific up-regulation of LdhA in the proximal tubule, along with enhanced expression of oxidative stress pathways. There was a significant correlation between albuminuria and lactate in mice, and also in a Southeast Asian patient cohort consisting of individuals with type 2 diabetes and impaired kidney function. In the individuals with diabetes, this association was independent of ARB and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. Furthermore, urinary lactate levels predicted the clinical outcomes of doubling of serum creatinine or development of kidney failure, and there was a significant correlation between urinary lactate levels and biomarkers of tubular injury and epithelial stress. Thus, we suggest that kidney metabolic disruptions leading to enhanced generation of lactate contribute to the pathogenesis of DN and increased urinary lactate levels may be a potential biomarker for risk of kidney disease progression."

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a modern epidemic worldwide. Introducing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (i.e., ACEi or ARB) not only as blood-pressure-lowering agents, but also as nephroprotective drugs with antiproteinuric potential was a milestone in the therapy of CKD. For decades, this treatment remained the only proven strategy to slow down CKD progression. This situation changed some years ago primarily due to the introduction of drugs designed to treat diabetes that turned into nephroprotective strategies not only in diabetic kidney disease, but also in CKD unrelated to diabetes. In addition, several drugs emerged that precisely target the pathogenetic mechanisms of particular kidney diseases. Finally, the role of metabolic acidosis in CKD progression (and not only the sequelae of CKD) came to light. In this review, we aim to comprehensively discuss all relevant therapies that slow down the progression of non-diabetic kidney disease, including the lowering of blood pressure, through the nephroprotective effects of ACEi/ARB and spironolactone independent from BP lowering, as well as the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors, acidosis correction and disease-specific treatment strategies. We also briefly address the therapies that attempt to slow down the progression of CKD, which did not confirm this effect. We are convinced that our in-depth review with practical statements on multiple aspects of treatment offered to non-diabetic CKD fills the existing gap in the available literature. We believe that it may help clinicians who take care of CKD patients in their practice. Finally, we propose the strategy that should be implemented in most non-diabetic CKD patients to prevent disease progression."

            "abstract": "Diabetes is the most frequent cause of kidney disease that progresses to end-stage renal disease worldwide, and diabetic kidney disease is significantly related to unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes. Since the 1990s, specific therapies have emerged and been approved to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease, namely, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (NS-MRA), finerenone, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors). Mechanistically, these different classes of agents bring different anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and complementary hemodynamic effects to patients with diabetic kidney disease such that they have additive benefits on slowing disease progression. Within the coming year, there will be data on renal outcomes using the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide. All the aforementioned medications have also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, all three classes (maximally dosed ACEi or ARB, low-dose SGLT-2 inhibitors, and the NS-MRA, finerenone) form the \"pillars of therapy\" such that, when used together, they maximally slow diabetic kidney disease progression. Ongoing studies aim to expand these pillars with additional medications to potentially normalize the decline in kidney function and reduce associated cardiovascular mortality."

            "title": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, raised clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD affords the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending kidney replacement therapy and for intervention to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of ACEi or ARB in people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who did not have DM were selected for inclusion. Only studies of at least four weeks duration were selected. Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was carried out by two authors independently, using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another. When more than one study reported similar outcomes, data were pooled using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analysed using a Chi\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 test. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach MAIN RESULTS: Six studies randomising 9379 participants with CKD stages 1 to 3 (without DM) met our inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with hypertension; 79% were male from China, Europe, Japan, and the USA. Treatment periods ranged from 12 weeks to three years. Overall, studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias across all domains, and the quality of the evidence was poor, with GRADE rated as low or very low certainty. In low certainty evidence, ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo may make little or no difference to death (any cause) (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 15.37; I\u00b2 = 76%), total cardiovascular events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; I\u00b2 = 0%), cardiovascular-related death (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 11.66; I\u00b2 = 54%), stroke (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.03; I\u00b2 = 0%), myocardial infarction (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I\u00b2 = 0%), and adverse events (2 studies, 8873 participants): RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.41; I\u00b2 = 0%). It is uncertain whether ACEi (benazepril 10 mg or trandolapril 2 mg) compared to placebo reduces congestive heart failure (1 study, 8290 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) or transient ischaemic attack (1 study, 583 participants): RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.01; I\u00b2 = 0%) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ARB (losartan 50 mg) compared to placebo (1 study, 226 participants) reduces: death (any-cause) (no events), adverse events (RR 19.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 328.30), eGFR rate of decline (MD 5.00 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 3.03 to 6.97), presence of proteinuria (MD -0.65 g/24 hours, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.52), systolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.29), or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.10 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.29 to 1.09) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether ACEi (enalapril 20 mg, perindopril 2 mg or trandolapril 1 mg) compared to ARB (olmesartan 20 mg, losartan 25 mg or candesartan 4 mg) (1 study, 26 participants) reduces: proteinuria (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.20), systolic blood pressure (MD -3.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.08 to 0.08) or diastolic blood pressure (MD -1.00 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.31 to 1.31) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of ACEi or ARB in patients with stage 1 to 3 CKD who do not have DM. The available evidence is overall of very low certainty and high risk of bias. We have identified an area of large uncertainty for a group of patients who account for most of those diagnosed as having CKD."

            "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We hypothesized that triple therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT)-2, and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) would be superior to dual RAS/SGLT2 blockade in attenuating CKD progression in Col4a3 -deficient mice, a model of Alport syndrome. Late-onset ramipril monotherapy or dual ramipril/empagliflozin therapy attenuated CKD and prolonged overall survival by 2 weeks. Adding the nonsteroidal MR antagonist finerenone extended survival by 4 weeks. Pathomics and RNA sequencing revealed significant protective effects on the tubulointerstitium when adding finerenone to RAS/SGLT2 inhibition. Thus, triple RAS/SGLT2/MR blockade has synergistic effects and might attenuate CKD progression in patients with Alport syndrome and possibly other progressive chronic kidney disorders.\nBACKGROUND: Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plus sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT)-2 or the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) demonstrated additive renoprotective effects in large clinical trials. We hypothesized that triple therapy with RAS/SGLT2/MR inhibitors would be superior to dual RAS/SGLT2 blockade in attenuating CKD progression.\nMETHODS: We performed a preclinical randomized controlled trial (PCTE0000266) in Col4a3 -deficient mice with established Alport nephropathy. Treatment was initiated late (age 6 weeks) in mice with elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria and with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. We block-randomized 40 male and 40 female mice to either nil (vehicle) or late-onset food admixes of ramipril monotherapy (10 mg/kg), ramipril plus empagliflozin (30 mg/kg), or ramipril plus empagliflozin plus finerenone (10 mg/kg). Primary end point was mean survival.\nRESULTS: Mean survival was 63.7\u00b110.0 days (vehicle), 77.3\u00b15.3 days (ramipril), 80.3\u00b111.0 days (dual), and 103.1\u00b120.3 days (triple). Sex did not affect outcome. Histopathology, pathomics, and RNA sequencing revealed that finerenone mainly suppressed the residual interstitial inflammation and fibrosis despite dual RAS/SGLT2 inhibition.\nCONCLUSION: Experiments in mice suggest that triple RAS/SGLT2/MR blockade may substantially improve renal outcomes in Alport syndrome and possibly other progressive CKDs because of synergistic effects on the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments."

            "abstract": "In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), slowing kidney disease progression is an important therapeutic goal. Many patients with T2DM and CKD also have cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis), which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), are drugs with known antihypertensive effects as well as CV and kidney protective effects in patients with CKD. Studies have shown that adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to ACEI or ARB therapy has additive benefits in terms of kidney and CV protection in patients with CKD (with/without T2DM). For patients with CKD associated with T2DM who have persistent albuminuria despite taking the maximum tolerated dose of a RAASi, adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) has demonstrated CV and kidney benefits in clinical trials. In this article, we review the use of ACEIs and ARBs for their kidney and CV protective effects when used alone or in combination with a drug with a different mechanism of action. From reviewing the available evidence, it seems clear that a multimodal drug effort is needed to achieve maximum kidney and CV protective effects for patients with CKD associated with T2DM."

RAAS inhibitors have been the mainstay of chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment. Studies have shown that therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensinII receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the excretion of albuminuria and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with and without diabetes. In clinical practice, RAAS inhibitors are recommended as the antihypertensive of choice in patients with CKD and albuminuria with or without diabetes. In addition, they have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits beyond blood pressure control. The use of RAAS inhibitors in non-proteinuric nephropathy and advanced CKD is not without controversy. Double blockade of the RAAS is contraindicated. On the other hand, it is essential to know how to titrate doses and avoid side effects, mainly hyperkalaemia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade involves dual therapy with a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). It is hypothesized that dual RAAS blockade would result in a more complete inhibition of the RAAS cascade. However, large clinical trials on dual RAAS inhibition have shown increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia without additional benefit on mortality, cardiovascular events, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression compared to RAAS inhibitor monotherapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The development of newer, more selective non-steroidal MRAs as cardiorenal protective therapies has created a new opportunity for dual RAAS inhibition. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risks of AKI and hyperkalemia with dual RAAS blockade in patients with DKD.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCT) published from 1 January 2006 to 30 May 2022. The study population included adult patients with DKD receiving dual RAAS blockade. A total of 31 RCTs and 33\u2009048 patients were included in the systematic review. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects.\nRESULTS: There were 208 AKI events in 2690 patients on ACEi\u00a0+\u00a0ARB versus 170 in 4264 patients with ACEi or ARB monotherapy (pooled RR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23-1.39). There were 304 hyperkalemia events in 2818 patients on ACEi\u00a0+\u00a0ARB versus 208 in 4396 patients with ACEi or ARB monotherapy (pooled RR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.32-2.94). A non-steroidal MRA\u00a0+\u00a0ACEi or ARB showed no increase in the risk of AKI (pooled RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81-1.16) compared to ACEi or ARB monotherapy but had a 2-fold higher risk of hyperkalemia with 953 events in 7837 patients in dual therapy versus 454 events in 6895 patients in monotherapy (pooled RR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.84-2.28). A steroidal MRA\u00a0+\u00a0ACEi or ARB had a 5-fold higher risk of hyperkalemia with 28 events in 245 at risk in dual therapy versus five events in 248 at risk in monotherapy (pooled RR 5.42 95% CI: 2.15-13.67).\nCONCLUSION: Dual therapy with RAASi is associated with an increased risk of AKI and hyperkalemia compared to RAASi monotherapy. Conversely, dual therapy with RAAS inhibitors and non-steroidal MRAs have no additional risk of AKI but a similar risk of hyperkalemia, which is lower than dual therapy with RAAS inhibitors and steroidal MRAs."

Nephropathy is a major FD complication that can progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated early. Although enzyme replacement therapy and chaperone therapy are effective, other treatments such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can also provide nephroprotective effects when renal damage is also established. Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been approved as innovative drugs for treating chronic kidney disease. Thus, we plan a multicenter observational prospective cohort study to assess the effect of Dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, in FD patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-3. The objectives are to evaluate the effect of Dapagliflozin primarily on albuminuria and secondarily on kidney disease progression and clinical FD stability. Thirdly, any association between SGT2i and cardiac pathology, exercise capacity, kidney and inflammatory biomarkers, quality of life, and psychosocial factors will also be evaluated. The inclusion criteria are age \u2265 18; CKD stages 1-3; and albuminuria despite stable treatment with ERT/Migalastat and ACEi/ARB. The exclusion criteria are immunosuppressive therapy, type 1 diabetes, eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and recurrent UTIs. Baseline, 12-month, and 24-month visits will be scheduled to collect demographic, clinical, biochemical, and urinary data. Additionally, an exercise capacity and psychosocial assessment will be performed.

The leading causes of CKD is diabetes and hypertension, which together account for >50% of patients with end-stage kidney disease. Progressive CKD leads to the requirement for kidney replacement therapy with transplantation or dialysis. In addition, CKD, is a risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, particularly from structural heart disease and heart failure (HF). Until 2015, the mainstay of treatment to slow progression of both diabetic and many non-diabetic kidney diseases was blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin system inhibition; however, neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) nor angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in major trials in CKD. The emergence of cardiovascular and renal benefits observed with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) from clinical trials of their use as anti-hyperglycaemic agents has led to a revolution in cardiorenal protection for patients with diabetes. Subsequent clinical trials, notably DAPA-HF, EMPEROR, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated their benefits in reducing risk of HF and progression to kidney failure in patients with HF and/or CKD. The cardiorenal benefits-on a relative scale-appear similar in patients with or without diabetes. Specialty societies' guidelines are continually adapting as trial data emerges to support increasingly wide use of SGLT2i. This consensus paper from EURECA-m and ERBP highlights the latest evidence and summarizes the guidelines for use of SGLT2i for cardiorenal protection focusing on benefits observed relevant to people with CKD."

Adjusted logistic multivariate regression confirmed that older patients had less odds ratio of eGFR decline, independently of the presence of proteinuria, diabetes, ACEI/ARB use, sex, baseline eGFR, baseline phosphate and baseline 25(OH) vitamin D.\nCONCLUSION: Older patients present slower CKD progression even after multiple adjustments.

Pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications for glycemia, dyslipidemia, and BP control have shown success in slowing the progression of DKD. Traditional treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and more recently the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, nonsteroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as finerenone, and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, have led to added benefits on various outcomes. However, significant residual risk for DKD progression remains despite the current standard-of-care approaches. Arteriolar hyalinosis (AH) is among the key findings seen on kidney biopsies of patients with DKD. It results from the excessive accumulation of hyaluronan (HA) in the arterioles.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), or diastolic failure, accounts for half of all HF cases and differs from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Patients with HFpEF are typically older, female, and commonly seen with chronic kidney disease (CKD), one of the leading independent risk factors for mortality in these patients. Unfortunately, drugs that had shown significant improvements in mortality in HFrEF have not shown similar benefits in HFpEF. Recently, sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HFrEF patients and slow down CKD progression. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of this drug class on mortality and risk of end stage renal disease in patients with HFpEF, which is currently unclear.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed the Research Data Warehouse containing electronic health records from de-identified patients (n\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0266\u00a0290) from the University of Mississippi Medical Center from 2013 to 2022. HFpEF patients had an average follow-up of 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0years. Factors associated with increased all-cause mortality during HFpEF included age, male sex, and CKD. Interestingly, the only treatments associated with significant improvements in survival were angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and SGLT2i, regardless of CKD or diabetes status. Additionally, SGLT2i use was also associated with significant decrease in the risk of end stage renal disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of SGLT2i in an HFpEF population with relatively high rates of hypertension, CKD, and black race and suggests that improvements in mortality may be through preserving kidney function."

The renal effect of antihypertensive drugs was particularly conspicuous when RASi was started in combination with other conventional antihypertensive drugs at the early period of hospitalization (2nd day [IQR: 1-5.5]) and even in patients with moderately to severely diminished eGFR (&lt;\u200930\u00a0mL/min/1.73 m2) on admission. In contrast, CCB modestly restored eGFR during the observation period. Furthermore, renal survival probabilities were progressively deteriorated in patients who had manifested reduced eGFR (&lt;\u200915\u00a0mL/min/1.73 m2) or massive proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine\u2009\u2265\u20093.5\u00a0g/gCr) on admission. Early use of RASi was associated with a favorable 2-year renal survival probability (0.90 [95%CI: 0.77-1.0] vs. 0.63 [95%CI: 0.34-0.92] for RASi (\u2009+) and RASi (-), respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.036) whereas no apparent difference in renal survival was noted for CCB.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early use of RASi contributes to the renal functional recovery from acute reduction in eGFR among patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, RASi offers more favorable effect on 2-year renal survival, compared with CCB."

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main complications in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM), increasing the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Current therapeutic strategies that delay the progression of CKD and the development of CVD include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). In the progression of CKD and CVD, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation leads to inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, kidney and vascular system, making mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) as a promising therapeutic option in T2DM with CKD and CVD. Finerenone is the third generation highly selective non-steroidal MRAs. It significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. Finerenone also improves the cardiovascular-renal outcomes in T2DM patients with CKD and/or chronic heart failure (CHF). It is safer and more effective than the first- and second-generation MRAs due to its higher selectivity and specificity, resulting in a lower incidence of adverse effects including hyperkalemia, renal insufficiency and androgen-like effects. Finerenone shows potent effect on improving the outcomes of CHF, refractory hypertension, and diabetic nephropathy. Recently studies have shown that finerenone may have potential therapeutic effect on diabetic retinopathy, primary aldosteronism, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension and so on. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of finerenone, the new third-generation MRA, and compared with the first- and second-generation steroidal MRAs and other nonsteroidal MRAs. We also focus on its safety and efficacy of clinical application on CKD with T2DM patients. We hope to provide new insights for the clinical application and therapeutic prospect."

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about 10-15% of the German population with a\u00a0steady increase. It is assumed that CKD will become the 5th most common cause of death worldwide in 2040. CKD is associated with high risk of mortality, morbidity, related in particular to cardiovascular disease, as well as high healthcare costs. Clinical strategies to manage CKD should encompass extensive life-style modification including weight normalization, reduction of dietary protein and salt intakes, regular exercise and avoidance of nicotine. Pharmacologically it includes inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sodium-glucose co-transporter\u20112 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in both diabetes-related and non-diabetic CKD and strategies to control other risk factors such as proteinuria, hyperglycemia and lipid disturbances. Among the various measures aimed at slowing CKD progression, blood pressure control and in particular RAAS inhibitors have received the most attention. Another therapeutic option includes aldosterone inhibition, be it via classical aldosterone-antagonists or the new mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Avoidance of nephrotoxic agents (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) seems self-explanatory. Overall, given the often asymptomatic course of CKD in particular in early phases, patient education and self-empowerment as well as treatment in a\u00a0multidisciplinary team appear essential to stem the tide of patients with advanced kidney damage."

Patients with DKD frequently require dialysis or kidney transplantation to manage their ESKD.\nSUMMARY: Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important contributor to kidney disease progression, as highlighted by the results of trials evaluating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with albuminuria. Increasing evidence suggests the existence of a multidirectional network that involves aldosterone, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) as driving forces in the generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress-induced injury in the initiation of interstitial nephritis and eventual fibrosis in chronic kidney disease and DKD. The MR is a key element of this triangle, as highlighted by the beneficial effect of MR antagonists in preventing or reducing aldosterone- or Rac1-related effects in basic science studies, and the improved patient outcomes observed in clinical studies.\nKEY MESSAGES: Aldosterone can promote kidney disease in diabetes via the MR and via MR-independent actions through Rac1. However, the MR remains a key element of this triangle, with clinical data supporting the use of MR antagonists in delaying the progression of kidney disease in diabetes."

We examined the associations of discontinuation of ACEi/ARBs with risk of clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and advanced-CKD (estimated-glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2).\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based cohort study including 10,400 patients with T2D in Hong Kong stratified by continuation of ACEi/ARBs within 6 months after reaching eGFR &lt;30\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2 from January 01, 2002 to December 31, 2018 and observed until December 31, 2019.

Cox-model with time-dependent exposure and covariates was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes in a propensity-score overlap-weighted cohort. The risk of occurrence of hyperkalemia (plasma potassium &gt;5.5\u00a0mmol/L) in discontinued-ACEi/ARBs versus continued-ACEi/ARBs users was assessed in a register-based cohort.\nFINDINGS: In the population-based cohort of 10,400 ACEi/ARBs users with new-onset eGFR&lt;30\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2, 1766 (17.0%) discontinued ACEi/ARBs and 8634 (83.0%) persisted with treatment.

It is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of OS preparations in the adjunctive treatment of DKD by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nOBJECTIVE: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparations were evaluated for their efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapy to conventional drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) for DKD.\nMETHODS: We searched seven electronic literature databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ACEI/ARB and OS combined with ACEI/ARB from inception up to March 2022. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias independently. Evidence certainty was rated using the GRADE system. Standardized mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) was pooled with random effects models and was reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and Egger's test were performed using R software (version 14.2) (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42021248634).\nRESULTS: Thirty eight RCTs involving 3167 patients met the inclusion criteria. No trials were reported with outcomes about kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events. In meta-analysis, compared with the control group of ACEI/ARB alone, OS combined with ACEI/ARB can achieve better effects in the treatment of DKD on reducing serum creatinine (Scr) [MD<sub>Scr</sub> =-11.48 95% CI [-15.78, -7.18], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [MD<sub>BUN</sub>= -1.00, 95% CI [-1.44, -0.55], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01], \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22-MG) [SMD<sub>\u03b22</sub><sub>-</sub><sub>MG</sub>= -1.32, 95% CI [-2.27, -0.37], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01], cystatin C (CysC) [MD<sub>CysC</sub>=-0.64, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.45], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01], 24-h urine proteinuria (24hUP) [SMD<sub>24hUP</sub>= -1.99, 95% CI [-2.68; -1.31], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01], urine microalbumin (UALB) [MD<sub>UALB</sub>= -37.41, 95% CI [-44.76, -30.06], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01] and decreasing urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) [MD<sub>UAER</sub>= -24.11, 95% CI [-30.54, -17.68], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01] and albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) [SMD<sub>ACR</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 95% CI [-1.73, -0.29], p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01]. The OS adjuvant treatment also improved outcomes of blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipid, inflammation and oxidative stress. No significant change in fasting blood glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), malondialdehyde (MDA), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) was detected. Yet, no significant difference was found about the adverse events between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ophiocordyceps sinensis preparation combined with ACEI/ARB has beneficial influence on renal function, decrease proteinuria, dyslipidemia, and even oxidative stress and inflammation in DKD patients. However, there is no trial that evaluated outcomes of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events. Future study should move beyond surrogate endpoints to actual cardiovascular or renal outcome benefits with an aim to explore effects of OS preparation in the long-term."

Multivariate logistic regression models were performed for each outcome measure to evaluate associations with patient demographic, health system, and clinical factors.\nKEY RESULTS: Of 7199 patients with DKD, 80.3% had a care gap in SGLT2i prescription and 42.0% had a care gap in RAASi prescription. For SGLT2i, patients with A1C at goal (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.96-2.73), Black non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.15-1.87), and Hispanic race/ethnicity (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.92) were more likely to experience a care gap. For RAASi, patients with blood pressure at goal (aOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.21-1.49) were more likely to experience a care gap.\nCONCLUSIONS: The care gaps for SGLT2i and RAASi for patients with DKD with well-controlled diabetes and blood pressure suggest failure to recognize DKD as an independent indication for these medications. Racial/ethnic disparities for SGLT2i, but not for RAASi, suggest systemic racism exacerbates care gaps for novel medications. These factors can be targets for interventions to improve patient care."

However, the results of some studies have suggested that the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease may increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or slow its decline.\nMETHODS: In this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease (eGFR, &lt;30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area) either to discontinue or to continue therapy with RAS inhibitors. The primary outcome was the eGFR at 3 years; eGFR values that were obtained after the initiation of renal-replacement therapy were excluded. Secondary outcomes included the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); a composite of a decrease of more than 50% in the eGFR or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy, including ESKD; hospitalization; blood pressure; exercise capacity; and quality of life. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to age, eGFR, type of diabetes, mean arterial pressure, and proteinuria.\nRESULTS: At 3 years, among the 411 patients who were enrolled, the least-squares mean (\u00b1SE) eGFR was 12.6\u00b10.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the discontinuation group and 13.3\u00b10.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the continuation group (difference, -0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.5 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u20090.42), with a negative value favoring the outcome in the continuation group. No heterogeneity in outcome according to the prespecified subgroups was observed. ESKD or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy occurred in 128 patients (62%) in the discontinuation group and in 115 patients (56%) in the continuation group (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.65). Adverse events were similar in the discontinuation group and continuation group with respect to cardiovascular events (108 vs. 88) and deaths (20 vs. 22).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease, the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors was not associated with a significant between-group difference in the long-term rate of decrease in the eGFR.

            "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most frequent complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissue types, including kidney and heart. Aberrant and long-term activation of MR by aldosterone in patients with T2DM triggers detrimental effects (eg, inflammation and fibrosis) in these tissues. The suppression of aldosterone at the early stage of T2DM has been a therapeutic strategy for patients with T2DM-associated CKD. Although patients have been treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers for decades, RAS blockers alone are not sufficient to prevent CKD progression. Steroidal MR antagonists (MRAs) have been used in combination with RAS blockers; however, undesired adverse effects have restricted their usage, prompting the development of nonsteroidal MRAs with better target specificity and safety profiles. Recently conducted studies, Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD), have reported that finerenone, a nonsteroidal MRA, improves both renal and cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo. In this article, we review the history of MRA development and discuss the possibility of its combination with other treatment options, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and potassium binders for patients with T2DM-associated CKD."

            "abstract": "This review paper considers the consequences of modulating tubular reabsorption proximal to the macula densa by sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, acetazolamide, and furosemide in states of glomerular hyperfiltration. SGLT2 inhibitors improve renal function in early and advanced diabetic nephropathy by decreasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), presumably by activating the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism. Central in this paper is that the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy can only be partially explained by TGF activation, and there are alternative explanations. The sustained activation of TGF leans on two prerequisites: no or only partial adaptation should occur in reabsorption proximal to macula densa, and no or only partial adaptation should occur in the TGF response. The main proximal tubular and loop of Henle sodium transporters are sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), SGLT2, and the Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC2). SGLT2 inhibitors, acetazolamide, and furosemide are the most important compounds; inhibiting these transporters would decrease sodium reabsorption upstream of the macula densa and increase TGF activity. This could directly or indirectly affect TGF responsiveness, which could oppose sustained TGF activation. Only SGLT2 inhibitors can sustainably activate the TGF as there is only partial compensation in tubular reabsorption and TGF response. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to preserve GFR in both early and advanced diabetic nephropathy. Other than for early diabetic nephropathy, a solid physiological basis for these effects in advanced nephropathy is lacking. In addition, TGF has hardly been studied in humans, and therefore this role of TGF remains elusive. This review also considers alternative explanations for the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic patients such as the enhancement of microvascular network function. Furthermore, combination use of SGLT2 inhibitors and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). in diabetes can decrease inflammatory pathways, improve renal oxygenation, and delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy."

            "abstract": "Patient expectations of receiving antibiotics for common symptoms can trigger unnecessary use. We conducted a survey (n = 564) between January 2020 to June 2021 in public and private primary care clinics in Texas to study the prevalence and predictors of patients' antibiotic expectations for common symptoms/illnesses. We surveyed Black patients (33%) and Hispanic/Latine patients (47%), and over 93% expected to receive an antibiotic for at least 1 of the 5 pre-defined symptoms/illnesses. Public clinic patients were nearly twice as likely to expect antibiotics for sore throat, diarrhea, and cold/flu than private clinic patients. Lack of knowledge of potential risks of antibiotic use was associated with increased antibiotic expectations for diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) and cold/flu symptoms (OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.4). Lower education and inadequate health literacy were predictors of antibiotic expectations for diarrhea. Future antibiotic stewardship interventions should tailor patient education materials to include information on antibiotic risks and guidance on appropriate antibiotic indications."

            "title": "The Delayed Diagnosis of a Submassive Pulmonary Embolism Following Influenza A Infection Treated With Half-Dose Tenecteplase: A Case Report.",
            "abstract": "The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought renewed attention to thrombotic complications arising from respiratory viral infections, driven by inflammatory responses and activation of the coagulation cascade. While influenza typically resolves on its own, information about its thromboembolic risks remains limited. The persistence of symptoms and the similarity between influenza symptoms and those of pulmonary embolism (PE) often lead to diagnostic delays, which can significantly impact patient outcomes. We discuss\u00a0a case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented with dyspnea, syncope, and persistent symptoms following influenza A infection. Despite initial treatment with Tamiflu and subsequent antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, her condition worsened, leading to syncope and admission to the hospital. A diagnostic workup revealed saddle pulmonary emboli with right ventricular strain. She was treated with a half-dose of tenecteplase, resulting in significant clinical improvement and a notable reduction in thrombus burden on follow-up imaging. The thromboembolic complications of influenza A are not extensively documented compared to COVID-19, yet they can present with severe outcomes. Submassive PE, characterized by hemodynamic stability with signs of right ventricular strain, poses treatment challenges. While full-dose thrombolytics are generally avoided in intermediate-risk PE due to bleeding risks, half-dose thrombolytics such as tenecteplase can offer a safer alternative. Though not FDA-approved specifically for PE, tenecteplase has shown efficacy and was effectively used in this case.\u00a0Half-dose thrombolytics, including tenecteplase, may be a viable treatment option for certain cases of PE, offering a balance between efficacy and safety. This case highlights the importance of considering PE in patients with persistent respiratory symptoms post-influenza and demonstrates the potential of tenecteplase in managing submassive PE."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months (3HP) improves completion rate of latent tuberculosis infection treatment, but flu-like symptoms are common. The novel 1HP regimen, involving daily rifapentine plus isoniazid for 28\u00a0days, has demonstrated low toxicity in HIV-infected populations. We aimed to investigate whether 1HP has a lower incidence rate of systemic drug reaction (SDR) compared with 3HP during treatment in non-HIV populations.\nMETHODS: This randomized, multicentre trial compared the completion rate and risks of SDRs of 1HP and 3HP in aged \u226513\u00a0years non-HIV subjects with latent tuberculosis infection between September 2019 and September 2023 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04094012). We also investigated associations between SDRs and plasma levels of drugs and their metabolites.\nRESULTS: A total of 251 and 239 individuals were randomly assigned to 1HP and 3HP groups, respectively, with completion rates of 82.9% (208/251) and 84.5% (202/239), respectively. Among them, 12.7% (32/251) and 10.9% (26/239) of 1HP and 3HP groups experienced SDRs, respectively (p 0.522), predominantly urticaria in 1HP group (59.4% [19/32]) and flu-like syndrome in 3HP group (80.8% [21/26]). Among participants experiencing SDRs, 43.8% (14/32) and 34.6% (9/26) in 1HP and 3HP groups, respectively, completed treatment (p 0.470). Cutaneous reactions were more common in 1HP than 3HP group (32.7% [82/251] vs. 13.0% [31/239], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In 1HP group, urticaria was associated with a higher plasma desacetyl-rifapentine level (ug/mL) at both 2 (median [interquartile range]: 36.06 [17.46-50.79] vs. 22.94 [14.67-31.65], p 0.018) and 6\u00a0hours (26.13 [15.80-53.06] vs. 29.83 [18.13-34.01], p 0.047) after dosing.\nDISCUSSION: In non-HIV population, the incidence rate of SDR under 1HP is not lower than 3HP. Notably, urticaria, rather than flu-like syndrome, was the predominant SDR associated 1HP. The findings of this study underscore the feasibility of 1HP regimen in non-HIV populations with a high-completion rate exceeding 80%."

            "abstract": "Children's and adults' rhinosinusitis are two diseases that have both similarities and differences in anatomy, epidemiology, causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. At the same rhinosinusitis is one of the most common in otorhinolaryngology's practice, both in children and adults. The of adults paranasal sinuses (PNS) anatomy differs from children's PNS anatomy. Although ostiomeatal complex occlusion is recognized as a major cause of poor ventilation and drainage of the adult paranasal sinuses, it does not have a strong effect on pediatric rhinosinusitis, but adenoids play a key role. Adenoids are bacteria and biofilms reservoirs that cause chronic refractory rhinosinusitis regardless of pharyngeal tonsil size. The prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is lower in children than in adults. Diagnosis of children's rhinosinusitis is more difficult because nasal cavity endoscopic examination is performed rarely due to the occasional need of general anesthesia during the procedure. Moreover, it's necessary to take into account prevailing etiological role of viruses in ARS at children's age and chronic adenoiditis often accompanies pediatric CRS, which requires attention prescribing medical therapy as the basis of rhinosinusitis treatment. The DysheLORz based on Pelargonium sidoides roots is highly effective and safe for children's and adults ARS and CRS treatment, both as monotherapy and in combination with topical steroids and antibiotics. This herbal medicine immunomodulatory effect is mediated mainly by stimulating the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3. It activates macrophages and improves their phagocytic activity. IL-12, together with TNF-\u03b1, enhances NK and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes' activity against infected cells. IL-12 effect on Th1 lymphocytes maturation provides a link between innate and adaptive immunity. This is also increasing MCP-1, IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b2 chemokines synthesis and decreasing MIP-1\u03b1, ENA-78, GRO\u03b1 and IL-8 production in PNS and nasal mucosa. This leads to decrease of neutrophils chemotaxis to the inflammation site, and decline of serine proteases concentration (neutrophils main enzymes), that increases mucous membrane epithelial barrier permeability, reducing bacterial infections risk. Additionally, Pelargonium sidoides increases epithelial cells beating cilia frequency and inhibits hemagglutinin and neuraminidase present on influenza virus surface. The drug increases antimicrobial peptides production as defensins, human neutrophil peptides (HNP) and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which is also important for rapid inflammation regression in rhinosinusitis. It causes bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells inhibition, phagocytosis stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) release and oxidative burst. The medicine had a direct effect on Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenza. Based on these data, it is possible to explain the high effectiveness and safety of the drugs based on Pelargonium sidoides in ENT organs inflammation treatment, for both adults and children over 1 year old."

We used the average treatment effect (ATE) with 1:1 propensity score matching to examine the association of vaccination status with frequency of antibiotic prescription, frequency of healthcare facility consultation, risk of admission and risk of death in the follow-up period of the same season (from 1 January to 31 March).\nRESULTS: In total, 244\u200a642 people were enrolled. Matched data included 101\u200a734 people in each of the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups. The ATE of vaccination was -0.004 (95% CI -0.006 to -0.002) for the frequency of antibiotic prescription, -0.005 (-0.007 to -0.004) for the frequency of healthcare facility consultation, -0.001 (-0.002 to -0.001) for the risk of admission and 0.00 (0.00 to 0.00) for the risk of death.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that seasonal influenza vaccination is associated with lower frequencies of unnecessary antibiotic prescription and of healthcare facility consultation."

            "abstract": "Microbiota-derived desaminotyrosine (DAT) protects the host from influenza by modulating the type I interferon (IFN) response. The aim of this study was to investigate the antivirus effects of a DAT-producing bacteria strain. A comparative genomics analysis and UHPLC Q-Exactive MS were used to search for potential strains and confirm their ability to produce DAT, respectively. The anti-influenza functions of the DAT producer were evaluated using an antibiotic-treated mouse model by orally administering the specific strain before viral infection. The results showed the Lactiplantibacillus pentosus CCFM1227 contained the phy gene and produced DAT by degrading phloretin. In vivo, L. pentosus CCFM1227 re-inoculation increased the DAT level in feces, and protected from influenza through inhibiting viral replication and alleviating lung immunopathology. Furthermore, CCFM1227-derived DAT was positively correlated with the IFN-\u03b2 level in the lung. The transcriptome results showed that CCFM1227 activated gene expression in the context of the defense response to the virus, and the response to interferon-beta. Moreover, CCFM1227 treatment upregulated the expression of MHC-I family genes, which regulate the adaptive immune response. In conclusion, L. pentosus CCFM1227 exerted antiviral effects by producing DAT in the gut, and this may provide a potential solution for creating effective antiviral probiotics."

Anti-infective agents were considered according to their pharmacological group and potential harmful risk using the Australian and Swedish classification systems. Prevalence rate was estimated annually and by trimester. Average annual percent change (AAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Joinpoint regression.\nRESULTS: Among 7\u2009571\u2009035 pregnancies, 3\u2009027\u2009031 (40.0%) received \u22651 antibacterial. This proportion decreased significantly from 41.5% in 2010 to 36.1% in 2019 (AAPC\u2009=\u2009-1.7%, [95%CI, -2.5 to -1.0%]). Conversely, use of antiviral agents increased during the 10-year study period for anti-herpes simplex virus agents (AAPC\u2009=\u00a04.4%, [3.7-5.2%]), influenza agents (AAPC\u2009=\u200925.4%, [6.2-48.1%]) and for HIV-antiretroviral agents (AAPC\u2009=\u00a01.3%, [0.6-2.0%]).

We aimed to estimate the comparative risk of adverse drug events and attributable healthcare expenditures associated with inappropriate versus appropriate antibiotic prescriptions for common respiratory infections.\nMETHODS: We established a cohort of adults aged 18 to 64 years with an outpatient diagnosis of a bacterial (pharyngitis, sinusitis) or viral respiratory infection (influenza, viral upper respiratory infection, nonsuppurative otitis media, bronchitis) from 1 April 2016 to 30 September 2018 using Merative MarketScan Commercial Database. The exposure was an inappropriate versus appropriate oral antibiotic (ie, non-guideline-recommended vs guideline-recommended antibiotic for bacterial infections; any vs no antibiotic for viral infections). Propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between inappropriate antibiotics and adverse drug events. Two-part models were used to calculate 30-day all-cause attributable healthcare expenditures by infection type.\nRESULTS: Among 3 294 598 eligible adults, 43% to 56% received inappropriate antibiotics for bacterial and 7% to 66% for viral infections. Inappropriate antibiotics were associated with increased risk of several adverse drug events, including Clostridioides difficile infection and nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-6.41 and hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.18, respectively, for pharyngitis). Thirty-day attributable healthcare expenditures were higher among adults who received inappropriate antibiotics for bacterial infections ($18-$67) and variable (-$53 to $49) for viral infections.\nCONCLUSIONS: Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory infections were associated with increased risks of patient harm and higher healthcare expenditures, justifying a further call to action to implement outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs."

            "abstract": "Biofilms are complex structures formed by bacteria, fungi, or even viruses on biotic and abiotic surfaces, and they can be found in almost any part of the human body. The prevalence of biofilm-associated diseases has increased in recent years, mainly because of the frequent use of indwelling medical devices that create opportunities for clinically important bacteria and fungi to form biofilms either on the device or on the neighboring tissues. As a result of their resistance to antibiotics and host immunity factors, biofilms have been associated with the development or persistence of several clinically important diseases. The inability to completely eradicate biofilms drastically increases the burden of disease on both the patient and the healthcare system. Therefore, it is crucial to develop innovative ways to tackle the growth and development of biofilms. This review focuses on dental- and implant-associated biofilm infections, their prevalence in humans, and potential therapeutic intervention strategies, including the recent advances in pharmacology and biomedical engineering. It lists current strategies used to control the formation of clinically important biofilms, including novel antibiotics and their carriers, antiseptics and disinfectants, small molecule anti-biofilm agents, surface treatment strategies, and nanostructure functionalization, as well as multifunctional coatings particularly suitable for providing antibacterial effects to the surface of implants, to treat either dental- or implant-related bacterial infections."

Some trials show that probiotic strains can prevent respiratory infections. Even though our previously published review showed the benefits of probiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), several new studies have been published. This is an update of a review first published in 2011 and updated in 2015.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose), compared with placebo or no treatment, in the prevention of acute URTIs in people of all ages, at risk of acute URTIs.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2022, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to May week 2, 2022), Embase (1974 to 10 May 2022), Web of Science (1900 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, which includes the China Biological Medicine Database (from 1978 to 10 May 2022), the Chinese Medicine Popular Science Literature Database (from 2000 to 10 May 2022), and the Master's Degree Dissertation of Beijing Union Medical College Database (from 1981 to 10 May 2022). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials on 10 May 2022.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing probiotics with placebo or no treatment to prevent acute URTIs. The participants were children, adults, or the elderly in the community, care facilities, schools, or hospitals. Our main outcomes were the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event and at least three events), the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of acute URTIs, and the mean duration of an episode of URTIs. Our secondary outcomes were the number of participants who were absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs; the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs; and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event from probiotics. We excluded studies if they did not specify acute respiratory infections as 'upper'; studies with more than 50% of participants vaccinated against influenza or other acute URTIs within the last 12 months; and studies with significantly different proportions of vaccinated participants between the probiotics arm and the placebo or no treatment arm.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We analysed both intention-to-treat and per-protocol data and used a random-effects model. We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 23 individual RCTs and one cluster-RCT. As one of the individual RCTs did not report outcomes in a usable way, we could only meta-analyse data from 23 trials, involving a total of 6950 participants including children (aged from one month to 11 years old), adults (mean age 37.3), and older people (mean age 84.6 years). One trial reported 22.5% flu-vaccine participants within the last 12 months, and 25.4% flu-vaccine participants during the intervention. Probiotics were more likely to be given with milk-based food in children; administered in powder form in adults; and given with milk-based food or in capsules in the elderly. Most of the studies used one or two strains (e.g. Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei (8700:2 or N1115)) and 109 or 1011 colony-forming units (CFU)/day of probiotics for more than three months. We found that probiotics may reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least one event) (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87; P &lt; 0.001; 16 studies, 4798 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants diagnosed with URTIs (at least three events) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.91; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 763 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce the incidence rate (number of cases/person year) of URTIs (rate ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92, P = 0.001; 12 studies, 4364 participants; low-certainty evidence); may reduce the mean duration of an episode of acute URTIs (MD -1.22 days, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.33; P = 0.007; 6 studies, 2406 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce the number of participants who used prescribed antibiotics for acute URTIs (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.81; P = 0.001; 6 studies, 1548 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and may not increase the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; P = 0.79; 8 studies, 2456 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence showing a decrease in the number of people absent from childcare centre, school, or work due to acute URTIs with probiotics is very uncertain (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events from probiotics were minor, and most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea, and bowel pain.\u00a0 AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that probiotics were better than placebo or no treatment in preventing acute URTIs."

            "abstract": "Venetian quarantine 400\u00a0years ago was an important public health measure. Since 1900 this has been refined to include \"challenge\" or deliberate infection with pathogens be they viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Our focus is virology and ranges from the early experiments in Cuba with Yellow Fever Virus to the most widespread pathogen of our current times, COVID-19. The latter has so far caused over four million deaths worldwide and 190 million cases of the disease. Quarantine and challenge were also used to investigate the Spanish Influenza of 1918 which caused over 100 million deaths. We consider here the merits of the approach, that is the speeding up of knowledge in a practical sense leading to the more rapid licensing of vaccines and antimicrobials. At the core of quarantine and challenge initiatives is the design of the unit to allow safe confinement of the pathogen and protection of the staff. Most important though is the safety of volunteers. We can see now, as in 1900, that members of our society are prepared and willing to engage in these experiments for the public good. Our ethnology study, where the investigator observed the experiment from within the quarantine, gave us the first indication of changing attitudes amongst volunteers whilst in quarantine. These quarantine experiments, referred to as challenge studies, human infection studies, or \"controlled human infection models\" involve thousands of clinical samples taken over two to three weeks and can provide a wealth of immunological and molecular data on the infection itself and could allow the discovery of new targets for vaccines and therapeutics. The Yellow Fever studies from 121\u00a0years ago gave the impetus for development of a successful vaccine still used today whilst also uncovering the nature of the Yellow Fever agent, namely that it was a virus. We outline how carefully these experiments are approached and the necessity to have high quality units with self-contained air-flow along with extensive personal protective equipment for nursing and medical staff. Most important is the employment of highly trained scientific, medical and nursing staff. We face a future of emerging pathogens driven by the increasing global population, deforestation, climate change, antibiotic resistance and increased global travel. These emerging pathogens may be pathogens we currently are not aware of or have not caused outbreaks historically but could also be mutated forms of known pathogens including viruses such as influenza (H7N9, H5N1 etc.) and coronaviruses. This calls for challenge studies to be part of future pandemic preparedness as an additional tool to assist with the rapid development of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, immunomodulators and new vaccines."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous Mycobacterium infections, particularly Mycobacterium abscessus, are increasingly common among patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchiectatic lung diseases. Treatment is challenging due to intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Bacteriophage therapy represents a potentially novel approach. Relatively few active lytic phages are available and there is great variation in phage susceptibilities among M. abscessus isolates, requiring personalized phage identification.\nMETHODS: Mycobacterium isolates from 200 culture-positive patients with symptomatic disease were screened for phage susceptibilities. One or more lytic phages were identified for 55 isolates. Phages were administered intravenously, by aerosolization, or both to 20 patients on a compassionate use basis and patients were monitored for adverse reactions, clinical and microbiologic responses, the emergence of phage resistance, and phage neutralization in serum, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\nRESULTS: No adverse reactions attributed to therapy were seen in any patient regardless of the pathogen, phages administered, or the route of delivery. Favorable clinical or microbiological responses were observed in 11 patients. Neutralizing antibodies were identified in serum after initiation of phage delivery intravenously in 8 patients, potentially contributing to lack of treatment response in 4 cases, but were not consistently associated with unfavorable responses in others. Eleven patients were treated with only a single phage, and no phage resistance was observed in any of these.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phage treatment of Mycobacterium infections is challenging due to the limited repertoire of therapeutically useful phages, but favorable clinical outcomes in patients lacking any other treatment options support continued development of adjunctive phage therapy for some mycobacterial infections."

            "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ergoferon in combination with symptomatic therapy in children from 6 months to 6 years old with acute respiratory infections (ARI) in contemporary outpatient practice, an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was performed. Derived by technological treatment of antibodies to interferon gamma, histamine, and CD4, Ergoferon was previously proved to modulate its molecular targets promoting effective antiviral protection. The data of 282 patients with oral temperature \u226538.0\u00b0C plus mild to moderate severity of flu-like nonspecific and nasal/throat/chest symptoms were included in intention-to-treat analysis (n\u2009=\u2009140, Ergoferon group; n\u2009=\u2009142, placebo group). Time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms was the primary endpoint, and 8 outcome measures were estimated as the secondary endpoints. Respiratory viruses were confirmed in 57.1% (Ergoferon) and 54.9% (Placebo) of patients. Compared to placebo, Ergoferon reduced time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms (4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 versus 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 days in placebo; p=0.026) including fever (2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 vs 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0; p=0.031), flu-like nonspecific (4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 vs 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2, p=0.022), and nasal/throat/chest (4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 versus 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3; p=0.024) symptoms. Ergoferon add-on therapy decreased the mean total symptom severity score (according to 4-point scale for each symptom), ARI severity, frequency of antipyretic use, and percentage of complication requiring antibiotics and increased the percentage of recovered patients. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the Ergoferon group was significantly lower compared to the placebo group (7.0% versus 18.8%; p=0.004) including infectious diseases (3.5% vs 12.5%; p=0.008). In the Ergoferon group, AEs were mild or moderate. In 8 (57.1%) cases, AEs were unrelated to Ergoferon, in 5 (35.7%), the relationship was uncertain, and in 1 (7.1%), it was possible (mild rash on the face). Ergoferon treatment is beneficial for infants and young children with ARI in contemporary outpatient practice. Being well-tolerated, Ergoferon increases the symptomatic therapy effectiveness and improves the patient condition and disease outcomes."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause for hospitalization and antibiotic overuse. We aimed to improve antibiotic duration for CAP across 41 hospitals participating in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS).\nMETHODS: This prospective collaborative quality initiative included patients hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP who qualified for a 5-day antibiotic duration. Between 23 February 2017 and 5 February 2020, HMS targeted appropriate 5-day antibiotic treatment through benchmarking, sharing best practices, and pay-for-performance incentives. Changes in outcomes, including appropriate receipt of 5 \u00b1 1-day antibiotic treatment and 30-day postdischarge composite adverse events (ie, deaths, readmissions, urgent visits, and antibiotic-associated adverse events), were assessed over time (per 3-month quarter), using logistic regression and controlling for hospital clustering.\nRESULTS: A total of 41 hospitals and 6553 patients were included. The percentage of patients treated with an appropriate 5\u2005\u00b1\u20051-day duration increased from 22.1% (predicted probability, 20.9% [95% confidence interval: 17.2%-25.0%]) to 45.9% (predicted probability, 43.9% [36.8%-51.2%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per quarter, 1.10 [1.07-1.14]). Thirty-day composite adverse events occurred in 18.5% of patients (1166 of 6319) and decreased over time (aOR per quarter, 0.98 [95% confidence interval: .96-.99]) owing to a decrease in antibiotic-associated adverse events (aOR per quarter, 0.91 [.87-.95]).\nCONCLUSIONS: Across diverse hospitals, HMS participation was associated with more appropriate use of short-course therapy and fewer adverse events in hospitalized patients with uncomplicated CAP. Establishment of national or regional collaborative quality initiatives with data collection and benchmarking, sharing of best practices, and pay-for-performance incentives may improve antibiotic use and outcomes for patients hospitalized with uncomplicated CAP."

            "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections are underestimated because they are mild and disabling, but in clinical medicine, these are the most prevalent problems. According to the World Health Organization third-most comprehensive cause of death in the world till 2030 would be Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dominating viruses of respiratory infections are influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infections, and they do not effectively manage viral infections like sinusitis, sore throats, bronchitis, influenza, and common respiratory infections. Presently no medication is available only symptomatic interventions is an option in our hand. However, a lot of research is going on the vaccine and drugs-based approaches against respiratory viruses worldwide. Traditional medicines are getting the attraction to treat many diseases. It is vital to screen the medicinal plants to find the potential of new compounds for treatment against antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Licorice) pharmacological actions modulate the immune system, inhibit virus growth, produce anti-inflammatory activity, and inactivate viruses. This comprehensive review mainly focuses on the role of licorice in managing respiratory infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including complications associated with its excess intake. There has been limited human research's exhibited licorice effectiveness in respiratory infections; therefore, there is a need for uncompromising and long-term research. This paper will be a valuable reference for biologists and physicians looking for a medication for respiratory infections. Glycyrrhiza glabra could open the door to novel agents in drug discovery and development."

            "abstract": "Respiratory infections (RI) significantly burden patients, their families, and society. Respiratory infection recurrence (RRI) usually depends on a defect of the immune response, which can be more or less transient and/or selective. In particular, children, older people, heavy smokers, and patients with chronic diseases, characterized by an inadequate immune response, may be at risk of developing RRI. In this context, OM- 85 could represent a valuable option in the management of RRI. OM-85 is a bacterial lysate containing the extracts of some common pathogens, including Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Methodologically rigorous studies have documented the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of OM-85. OM-85 enhances the natural and acquired immune response through multifaceted mechanisms. Substantial evidence has shown that OM-85 can prevent respiratory infections, reduce the number of COPD exacerbations, and shorten the disease duration at home or in hospital. OM-85 can enhance the effectiveness of the 'flu vaccination without affecting the vaccine tolerability. The preventive use of OM-85 can reduce the use of antibiotics, contributing to contrast antibiotic resistance and saving the high cost of chronic respiratory diseases. Further studies should define the ideal candidate to OM-85 treatment."

Randomized-controlled trials (RCT) that enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza receiving neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) or baloxavir comparing to placebo were assessed. PROSPERO Registration-number: CRD42021226854.\nRESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs (11,697 patients) were included. Antiviral administration significantly reduced time to clinical resolution (mean difference: -21.3\u00a0hours) and total influenza-related complications (OR:0.55, 95%CI: 0.42-0.73). Specifically, antivirals significantly decreased bronchitis (OR:0.54, 95%CI: 0.38-0.75), sinusitis (OR:0.51, 95%CI: 0.33-0.78), acute otitis media (OR:0.48, 95%CI: 0.30-0.77), and antibiotic prescription (OR:0.62; 95%CI: 0.48-0.80). A positive trend favored antivirals administration to reduce pneumonia (OR:0.47, 95%CI: 0.16-1.33), or hospitalization rates (OR:0.65; 95%CI: 0.34-1.24) compared to placebo, but did not reach statistical significance. Adverse events (AE) were reported in 11%, 8.9%, and 5.1% of NAIs, placebo and baloxavir recipients, respectively.

This pragmatic trial examines whether early co-amoxiclav use reduces reconsultation due to clinical deterioration in \"at risk\" children presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary or ambulatory care.\nMETHODS: \"At risk\" children aged from 6\u2005months to 12\u2005years presenting within 5\u2005days of ILI onset were randomly assigned to oral co-amoxiclav 400/57 or a placebo twice daily for 5\u2005days (dosing based on age\u00b1weight). \"At risk\" groups included children with respiratory, cardiac and neurological conditions. Randomisation was stratified by region and used a non-deterministic minimisation algorithm to balance age and current seasonal influenza vaccination status. Our target sample size was 650 children which would have allowed us to detect a reduction in the proportion of children reconsulting due to clinical deterioration from 40% to 26%, with 90% power and 5% two-tailed alpha error (including allowance for 25% loss to follow-up and an inflation factor of 1.041). Participants, caregivers and investigators were blinded to treatment allocation.

Safety analysis included all randomised participants.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 70714783. EudraCT 2013-002822-21.\nRESULTS: We recruited 271 children between February 11, 2015 and April 20, 2018. Primary outcome data were available for 265 children. Only 61 out of 265 children (23.0%) reconsulted due to clinical deterioration. No evidence of a treatment effect was observed for reconsultation due to clinical deterioration (33 out of 133 for co-amoxiclav (24.8%) and 28 out of 132 (21.2%) for placebo; adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.80). There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the proportion of children for whom one or more adverse events (AEs) were reported (32 out of 136 (23.5%) for co-amoxiclav and 22 out of 135 (16.3%) for placebo; adjusted RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.90-2.34). In total, 66 AEs were reported (co-amoxiclav, n=37; placebo, n=29). Nine serious AEs were reported per group, although none were considered related to study medication.\nCONCLUSION: Our trial did not find evidence that treatment with co-amoxiclav reduces risk of reconsultation due to clinical deterioration in \"at risk\" children who present early with ILI during influenza season. Our findings therefore do not support early co-amoxiclav use in children with seasonal ILI."

Meta-analysis used Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and pooled analysis for individual patient data with inverse variance weighted average. The study is registered at PROSPERO with the number of CRD4200270579. Forty-four studies with 36,716 participants were included in the pooled analysis and 20 studies in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed reduction of mortality (RR 0.57, 95% CI [0.43, 0.76], z\u00a0=\u00a03.86 [p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001], I2 \u00a0=\u00a044% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.03]) and higher number of discharged patients (RR 2.53, 95% CI [1.72, 3.72], z\u00a0=\u00a04.70 [p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001], I2 \u00a0=\u00a03% [p\u00a0=\u00a00.39]) in patients receiving CPT compared to standard care alone. A possible mechanism of action is prompt reduction in viral titre.

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Corticosteroids have been considered in medicine for a long time, and they are broadly prescribed. In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, the evidence is quite strong and there is a clear benefit of the use of corticosteroids in those patients presenting severe forms of disease."

In addition, patients in both groups received routine supportive treatment, including oxygen inhalation, symptomatic therapy, and/or human intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or serum albumin, and treatment for underlying diseases. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on changes related with clinical manifestations, computer tomography (CT) scan images, and laboratory examinations before and after the treatment.\nRESULTS: 55 severe COVID-19 patients, with 23 in CM group and 32 in WM group, were included for analyzed. There was no case of death, being transferred to ICU, or receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in two groups during hospitalization. The median time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in CM and WM group were 12 days and 15.5 days respectively, the ratio of nucleic acid negative conversion of CM group at different follow-up time points was significantly higher than that of WM group (HR: 2.281, P = 0.018). Further, the chest CT imaging showed more widely lung lesion opacity absorbed in the CM group. The high sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum ferritin decreased significantly in the CM group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in adverse events in terms of liver function and renal function between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Based on this retrospective analysis from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, CM has better effects in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, promoting lung lesion opacity absorbed and reducing inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients, which is effective and safe therapy for treating severe COVID-19 and reducing mortality."

Here we evaluated the safety profile and treatment benefits of Echinacea in children with acute cold and flu symptoms. Methods: A total of 79 children (4-12 years) were randomized to a treatment regimen of three or five times daily Echinaforce Junior tablets (total of 1200 or 2000 mg Echinacea extract, EFJ) for the prospective treatment of upcoming cold and flu episodes at first signs. Parents recorded respiratory symptoms daily during episodes in their child and physicians and parents subjectively rated tolerability. Results: EFJ was used to treat 130 cold episodes in 68 children and was very well tolerated by more than 96% positive physician's ratings. EFJ-treated cold episodes lasted 7.5 days on average, with nine out of 10 episodes being fully resolved after 10 days. Five EFJ tablets daily reduced the average episode duration by up to 1.7 days (p &lt; 0.02) in comparison to three EFJ tablets daily regimen. Effective symptom resolution finally contributed to a low antibiotic prescription rate in this study of 4.6%. Conclusions: EFJ tablets present a valuable option for the treatment of acute cold episodes in children showing a wide safety margin and increased therapeutic benefits at five tablets daily."

A cross-sectional online questionnaire survey was performed by recruiting 4822 participants. There were 76.09% of the participants reporting that they learned more knowledge of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic. The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.30, p&lt;\u00a0.001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment. Regression analyses showed that the medical profession and history of influenza vaccination were both associated with higher knowledge or attitude score and participants' use of face masks in previous seasons and their willingness to receive influenza vaccination. In conclusion, the awareness of influenza vaccination among adults in China should be reinforced and educational campaigns were warranted to increase the coverage of influenza vaccination."

The primary outcomes were the time to defervescence and decrease of the Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score (PRESS) during hospitalization. The secondary outcomes were serial changes in virus titers, measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four patients were enrolled (28 in the control group and 26 in the combination group) in total. There were no differences in the patients' baseline characteristics between the groups. The time to defervescence was significantly shorter in the combination group than the oseltamivir group (13.2\u00a0h vs. 32.1\u00a0h, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). The decrease in the virus titer from days 1-3 (log \u039413) was more pronounced in the combination group than the oseltamivir group. (39% vs. 19%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). There were no differences in adverse effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain during the study or within 30 days after antiviral therapy.\nCONCLUSION: The clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination group experienced a more rapid defervescence and a more rapid decline of influenza virus titer than the group treated with oseltamivir alone. Further consideration should be given to whether the overall benefits of combination therapy in hospitalized pediatric influenza patients outweigh the risks."

            "title": "Azithromycin in viral infections.",
            "abstract": "Azithromycin (AZM) is a synthetic macrolide antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacterial and mycobacterial infections. Due to an additional range of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, it has been given to patients with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is now being investigated as a potential candidate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 having been identified as a candidate therapeutic for this virus by both in vitro and in silico drug screens. To date there are no randomised trial data on its use in any novel coronavirus infection, although a large number of trials are currently in progress. In this review, we summarise data from in vitro, murine and human clinical studies on the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of macrolides, particularly AZM. AZM reduces in vitro replication of several classes of viruses including rhinovirus, influenza A, Zika virus, Ebola, enteroviruses and coronaviruses, via several mechanisms. AZM enhances expression of anti-viral pattern recognition receptors and induction of anti-viral type I and III interferon responses. Of relevance to severe coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), which is characterised by an over-exuberant innate inflammatory response, AZM also has anti-inflammatory properties including suppression of IL-1beta, IL-2, TNF and GM-CSF. AZM inhibits T cells by inhibiting calcineurin signalling, mammalian target of rapamycin activity and NF\u03baB activation. AZM particularly targets granulocytes where it concentrates markedly in lysosomes, particularly affecting accumulation, adhesion, degranulation and apoptosis of neutrophils. Given its proven safety, affordability and global availability, tempered by significant concerns about antimicrobial stewardship, there is an urgent mandate to perform well-designed and conducted randomised clinical trials."

All patients were examined for the presence of influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR. Patients of the main group received enisamium iodide along with symptomatic therapy, the control group received only symptomatic therapy. The primary parameter of the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated on the scale of the general severity of the manifestations of ARVI (Total Symptom Score TSS) from the 2nd to the 4th day and by the secondary criteria of effectiveness: assessment of the duration of ARVI, the severity of fever, the proportion of patients with normal body temperature, the duration of the main clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, the proportion of patients in whom complications requiring antibiotics were noted, the dynamics of interferon status on the 6th day. To conduct a statistical analysis, depending on the efficiency parameter, the ANCOVA method with a fixed group factor and an initial score on the TSS severity scale was used as covariates, a criterion for comparing quantitative indicators in two independent groups.\nRESULTS: According to the results of the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, the median (interquartile range) of the average score on the scale of the general severity of ARVI manifestations in the main group was 4.33 (3.675.83), in the comparison group 6.00 (4.677.25; p0.001). The duration of systemic and local manifestations of acute respiratory viral infections was statistically significantly less in the main group (p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). Prescription of additional therapy was required in 2 (2.9%) patients of the main group (patients taking enisamium iodide), compared with 8 (11.9%) patients in the control group. Serum levels of interferon \uf0e1 and interferon \uf0e3 on the last day of treatment were statistically significantly higher in patients of the main group compared with the control group (p0.001). Treatment (excellent) was evaluated by 42 (62.7%) patients, while in the control group only 17 (25.8%) patients gave similar ratings. Both patients (p0.001) and doctors (p0.002) rated therapy tolerance better in the study group.\nCONCLUSION: The results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of enisamium iodide as a treatment for ARVI and influenza. The antiviral, interferonogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are involved in the formation of an antiviral response and reduce the risk of complications, which makes it possible to reduce the number of symptomatic agents used."

There is an increase in the incidence of bacterial complications - 2.2 times, an increase in the frequency of systemic antibiotics - 2.3 times. The purpose of the drug prescription led to a more rapid regression of all the symptoms of influenza and ARVI, but the most striking positive dynamics was observed in the symptoms of general weakness and headache. The prescription of Kagocel was accompanied by a 58% reduction in the number of bacterial complications and a 53% reduction in the use of antibiotics, which led to a reduction in the number of cases of the disease and an improvement in initial diseases, with an frequency increase in 1.8 times. The most significant effect achieved with early treatment and early initiation of antiviral therapy (in the first 48 hours of the disease)."

Active TB incidence was compared between the two groups with 37\u00a0months of follow-up. Safety profile and complete rates were evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 1227 adults with silicosis were screened; 513 eligible participants were enrolled and assigned to 3RPT/INH (n\u00a0=\u00a0254) vs. observation (n\u00a0=\u00a0259). Twenty-eight participants were diagnosed with active TB, and 9 and 19 in the 3RPT/INH group and observation groups, respectively. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative active TB rate was 3.5% (9/254) in the 3RPT/INH group and 7.3% (19/259) in the observation group (log rank p 0.055). On per protocol analysis, the cumulative active TB rates were 0.7% (1/139) and 7.3% (19/259), respectively (log rank p 0.01). Owing to an unexpected high frequency of adverse events (70.4%) and Grade 3 or 4 AEs (7.9%), the completion rate of the 3RPT/INH regimen was 54.7% (139/254). Twenty-six (10.8%) participants had flu-like systemic drug reactions; five (2.1%) experienced hepatotoxicity.\nDISCUSSION: Weekly rifapentine/isoniazid prophylaxis prevented active TB among Chinese people with silicosis when taken, irrespective of LTBI screening; efficacy was reduced by lack of compliance.

The objective of this report is to describe a case of self-medication with a fish antibiotic resulting in delayed medical treatment and provide recommendations for pharmacists practicing in outpatient settings on how to best identify and manage nonprescription antibiotic use.\nCASE SUMMARY: A 24-year-old man experienced dental pain and \"flu-like\" symptoms for which he attempted self-treatment with oral amoxicillin 250 mg daily purchased by a family member from a pet store. The amoxicillin was marketed for the treatment of bacterial infection in pet fish. After several days of increasing tooth pain despite the self-medication, the patient presented to an outpatient clinic where he was found to have a molar abscess requiring tooth extraction. The patient responded well to therapy and was counseled to discontinue antibiotic self-treatment.\nPRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Undocumented use of nonprescription antibiotics represents a threat to patient safety. Potential deleterious outcomes include resistance, adverse drug events, and delays in definitive infection treatment. Pharmacists should screen patients for nonprescription antibiotic use, provide them counseling on appropriate antibiotic use, and educate other health care professionals on underrecognized sources of nonprescription antibiotics to increase awareness of this growing issue. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance should be considered when recommending an antibiotic agent for the treatment of infections."

Early initiation of treatment is associated with improved outcomes. In clinical practice, empirical oseltamivir treatment is therefore commonly started prior to diagnostic microbiological confirmation. There is limited data on the patient characteristics, outcomes and safety of this practice. This study investigated outcomes and safety of this pre-emptive treatment strategy using oseltamivir.\nMETHODS: Descriptive analysis of LTRs who received oseltamivir for \u22652 days for suspected influenza infection between July 2011 and June 2012. Analyses were based on data from electronic medical records and our standardized LTR database with prospective documentation of clinical information including medication, laboratory and radiological results, outcomes and adverse events.\nRESULTS: We included 133 patients with a total of 261 oseltamivir treatment episodes (87.4% as outpatients). Median duration of oseltamivir treatment was 4 days (range 2 to 67) and 98.5% had concomitant antibiotic pharmacotherapy. Indications for oseltamivir included acute respiratory infection (66.7%), non-distinctive inflammatory reaction (51.3%) and influenza-like illness (2.7%). Influenza virus infection was confirmed by PCR in only 7%. Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen detected (14.9%). We discovered a wide range of adverse events but none occurred in >5%, and most were mild and of questionable causal relationship to oseltamivir administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: This non-controlled retrospective analysis suggests that the pre-emptive use of oseltamivir for respiratory tract infections pending microbiological results is safe in LTRs."

In recent years the VPH is gaining increasing importance because immense changes have occurred in animal production processes and agricultural structures. The aim of this paper is to describe the current VPH activities in Bangladesh, its major constraints and future activities plan to ensure safe food production as well as protect the environment and public health.\nMAIN TEXT: VPH concerns all areas of food production and safety, zoonosis control, environmental protection and animal welfare. In Bangladesh, the VPH unit was established in 1984 by the Directorate of Livestock Services (DLS) for zoonosis control and production of wholesome food of animal origin. Zoonoses are the core domain of VPH. Bangladesh is facing the emergence of zoonotic diseases including anthrax, tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, E. coli infections, avian influenza, rabies, nipah and dengue virus infections.. Multi-drug resistance bacteria are emerging due to indiscriminate uses of antibiotics in livestock and poultry industries. Lack of proper slaughter houses, antemortem and postmortem inspections of carcasses by qualified veterinarians contributes greatly to unwholesome meat production. The VPH unit has a significant role to play to ensure better public health. However, there are many constraints that affect the VPH services. Absence of VPH services at all administrative level, inadequate budget, lack of qualified personnel, poor lab facilities, absence of legal framework, and the lack of coordination with health department are the major constraints.\nCONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of VPH issues in Bangladesh is very large. Therefore it is important to carefully set priorities in order to ensure effective and efficient VPH services. Establishment of VPH units at all levels, effective surveillance for zoonotic diseases, institution of legal framework to define role of VPH services, creation of public health awareness, collaborative works with health departments, improving laboratory facilities and training programs for the veterinarian are keys to ensure better VPH services in Bangladesh."

The rate of prescribing for each condition was observed over time and mean change points were compared with national guideline updates. Any correlation between the rate of prescribing for each infectious condition was estimated within a practice. Predictors of prescribing were estimated using logistic regression in a matched patient cohort (1:1 by age, sex and calendar time).\nRESULTS: Over 8 million patient records were examined in 587 UK general practices. Practices varied considerably in their propensity to prescribe antibiotics and this variance increased over time. Change points in prescribing did not reflect updates to national guidelines. Prescribing levels within practices were not consistent for different infectious conditions. A history of antibiotic use significantly increased the risk of receiving a subsequent antibiotic (by 22%-48% for patients with three or more antibiotic prescriptions in the past 12\u2009months), as did higher BMI, history of smoking and flu vaccinations. Other drivers for receiving an antibiotic varied considerably for each condition.\nCONCLUSIONS: Large variability in antibiotic prescribing between practices and within practices was observed. Prescribing guidelines alone do not positively influence a change in prescribing, suggesting more targeted interventions are required to optimize antibiotic prescribing in the UK."

During the first season (2016/2017), respiratory viruses were detected using inhouse real-time PCR. The second season (2017/2018), we implemented a diagnostic flowchart including a rapid molecular test for 15 respiratory viruses (FilmArray\u00ae). We assessed the effect of this implementation on need for isolation, antivirals and empirical antibiotics.\nRESULTS: We included 192 immunocompromised adult patients during the first and 378 during the second season. Respiratory viral testing was performed in 135 patients (70%) during the first and 284 (75%) during the second season (p\u2009=\u20090.218) of which 213 (75%) using the rapid test. After implementation, use of in-hospital isolation facilities was reduced (adjusted odds ratio 0.35, 95%CI 0.19-0.64). Furthermore, adequate use of oseltamivir improved, with fewer prescriptions in influenza negative patients (0.15, 95%CI 0.08-0.28) and more in influenza positive patients (11.13, 95%CI 1.75-70.86). No effect was observed on empirical antibiotic use, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay or safety outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Implementation of rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in adult immunocompromised patients results in more adequate use of oseltamivir and in-hospital isolation facilities without compromising safety."

Most fatal cases were seen in those with recent cancer treatment and older adults.\nCONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus in hospitalized adults is associated with significant morbidity and mortality with 26.9% requiring ICU level care. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to patients with documented RSV, and antibiotics are frequently continued after diagnosis. Novel antiviral therapies are needed for RSV to improve outcomes and potentially improve antibiotic stewardship in patients without a bacterial infection."

This meta-analysis quantifies the effects of elderberry supplementation and evaluates moderators including vaccination status and the underlying pathology. This analysis included a total of 180 participants and evaluates moderators such as vaccination status and cause of the upper respiratory symptoms. Supplementation with elderberry was found to substantially reduce upper respiratory symptoms. The quantitative synthesis of the effects yielded a large mean effect size. These findings present an alternative to antibiotic misuse for upper respiratory symptoms due to viral infections, and a potentially safer alternative to prescription drugs for routine cases of the common cold and influenza."

Despite tremendous public and private funding and initial enthusiasm about missile-therapy for site-specific cancers, molecular targeting drugs for specific enzymes such as kinases or inhibitors of growth factor receptors, the outcomes are very bleak and disappointing. Major scientific reasons for repeated failures of such therapeutic approaches are attributed to reductionist approaches to research and infinite numbers of genetic mutations in chaotic molecular environment of solid tumors that are bases of drug development. Safety and efficacy of candidate drugs tested in test tubes or experimental tumor models of rats or mice are usually evaluated and approved by FDA. Cost-benefit ratios of such 'targeted' therapies are also far from ideal as compared with antibiotics half a century ago. Such alarming records of failure of clinical outcomes, the increased publicity for specific vaccines (e.g., HPV or flu) targeting young and old populations, along with increasing rise of cancer incidence and death created huge and unsustainable cost to the public around the globe.

This study aimed to examine pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between this regimen and dolutegravir, a first-line antiretroviral medication.\nMETHODS: This was a single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral dolutegravir 50 mg once daily alone (days 1-4) and concomitantly with once-weekly isoniazid 900 mg, rifapentine 900 mg, and pyridoxine 50 mg (days 5-19). Dolutegravir concentrations were measured on days 4, 14, and 19, and rifapentine, 25-desacetyl-rifapentine, and isoniazid concentrations were measured on day 19. Cytokines and antidrug antibodies to isoniazid and rifapentine were examined at select time points.\nRESULTS: The study was terminated following the development of flu-like syndrome and elevated aminotransferase levels in 2 of 4 subjects after the third isoniazid-rifapentine dose. Markedly elevated levels of interferon-\u03b3, CXCL10, C-reactive protein, and other cytokines were temporally associated with symptoms. Antidrug antibodies were infrequently detected.

Thus, inhibition of platelet aggregation can be a potential target for IAV treatment. Previous studies focus on the flavonoids from MH and their anti-inflammatory activities, but the anticoagulant compounds and potential molecular mechanism of MH remains unclear. This study was to isolate and characterize diketopiperazines (DKPs) from MH and to explore the underlying anticoagulant mechanism on IAV infection models.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: EtOAc sub-extract separated from MH ethanolic extract was subjected to fractionation through column chromatography. The chemical structures of pure compounds were characterized by the spectral analysis. Antiviral activities of DKPs were assayed in IAV-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and mice. Anticoagulant effects of DKPs were investigated on adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-induced acute pulmonary embolism and IAV-induced lung injury in vivo, as well as the inhibition on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro. The serum levels of thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> (TXB<sub>2</sub>) and 6-keto-PGF<sub>1\u03b1</sub> were detected by ELISA. The expressions of key proteins in CD41-mediated PI3K/AKT pathways were determined by western blotting analysis.\nRESULTS: Six DKPs were, for the first time, isolated from MH and identified as cyclo(Tyr-Leu) (1), cyclo(Phe-Phe) (2), cyclo(Phe-Tyr) (3), cyclo(Ala-Ile) (4), cyclo(Ala-Leu) (5) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe (6). Among these DKPs, cyclo(Ala-Ile) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe possessed low cytotoxicities and significant inhibition against cytopathic effects induced by IAV (H1N1 and H3N2) replication in MDCK cells. Furthermore, cyclo(Ala-Ile) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe significantly alleviated IAV-induced platelet activation and lung inflammation in mice. They could reduce the expression of CD41 and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in PLTs of IAV-infected mice.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggested that cyclo(Ala-Ile) and Bz-Phe-Phe-OMe isolated from MH have antiviral and anticoagulant effects against IAV-induced PLT aggregation and lung inflammation via regulating CD41/PI3K/AKT pathway, and could be used as the potential agents for IAV treatment."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is currently used to treat unresectable superficial tumours of different histotypes through the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and local application of electric pulses. In 2006, a collaborative project defined the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) guidelines to standardize the procedure. The International Network for Sharing Practices of Electrochemotherapy (InspECT) aims to refine the ESOPE and improve clinical practice. Limiting patient exposure to systemic chemotherapy would be advisable to ameliorate ECT safety profile.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of ECT with reduced chemotherapy dosages.\nMETHODS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database (InspECT registry), we evaluated the outcome of patients who received ECT with reduced dosages of bleomycin (7500, 10 000 or 13 500 IU/m2 , instead of the standard dose of 15 000 IU/m2 ). Tumour response in melanoma patients was compared with melanoma patients of the InspECT registry who received the standard dose of bleomycin.\nRESULTS: We identified 57 patients with 147 tumours (melanoma, 38.6%; squamous cell carcinoma, 22.8%; basal cell carcinoma, 17.5%; breast cancer 7%; Kaposi sarcoma 7%; other histotypes, 7.1%). Per-tumour complete response (CR) rate at 60 days was 70.1% (partial, 16.3%); per-patient CR was 57.9% (partial, 21.1%). Local pain was the most frequently reported side-effect (n = 22 patients [39%]), mostly mild; two patients experienced flu-like symptoms, one patient nausea. We observed the same CR rate (55%) in patients with melanoma treated by reduced or conventional bleomycin dosages (P = 1.00).\nCONCLUSIONS: Electrochemotherapy performed with reduced bleomycin dosages could be as effective as with currently recommended dose. Patients with impaired renal function or candidate to multiple ECT cycles could benefit from a reduced dose protocol. Our findings need prospective confirmation before being adopted in clinical practice."

            "title": "Informed Consent to Study Purpose in Randomized Clinical Trials of Antibiotics, 1991 Through 2011.",
            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Potential research participants may assume that randomized trials comparing new interventions with older interventions always hypothesize greater efficacy for the new intervention, as in superiority trials. However, antibiotic trials frequently use \"noninferiority\" hypotheses allowing a degree of inferior efficacy deemed \"clinically acceptable\" compared with an older effective drug, in exchange for nonefficacy benefits (eg, decreased adverse effects). Considering these different benefit-harm trade-offs, proper informed consent necessitates supplying different information on the purposes of superiority and noninferiority trials.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the degree to which the study purpose is explained to potential participants in randomized clinical trials of antibiotics and the degree to which study protocols justify their selection of noninferiority hypotheses and amount of \"clinically acceptable\" inferiority.\nDESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analysis of study protocols, statistical analysis plans (SAPs), and informed consent forms (ICFs) from clinical study reports submitted to the European Medicines Agency. The ICFs were read by both methodologists and patient investigators.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Protocols and SAPs were used as the reference standard to determine prespecified primary hypothesis and record rationale for selection of noninferiority hypotheses and noninferiority margins. This information was cross-referenced against ICFs to determine whether ICFs explained the study purpose.\nRESULTS: We obtained trial documents from 78 randomized trials with prespecified efficacy hypotheses (6 superiority, 72 noninferiority) for 17 antibiotics conducted between 1991 and 2011 that enrolled 39\u202f407 patients. Fifty were included in the ICF analysis. All ICFs contained sections describing study purpose; however, none consistently conveyed study hypothesis to both methodologists and patient investigators. Methodologists found that 1 of 50 conveyed a study purpose. Patient investigators found that 11 of 50 conveyed a study purpose, 7 accurately and 4 inaccurately compared with the reference standard. Seventy-one of 72 noninferiority trial protocols or SAPs provided no rationale for selection of noninferiority hypothesis. None provided a clinical rationale for the chosen amount of decreased efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients were not accurately informed of study purpose, which raises questions regarding the ethics of informed consent in antibiotic trials. Noninferiority and superiority trials entail different benefit-harm trade-offs that must be conveyed for ethical informed consent."

            "title": "Adverse events following live-attenuated intranasal influenza vaccination of children with cystic fibrosis: Results from two influenza seasons.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the approved use of live-attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine (LAIV) for seasonal immunization of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), many questions remain unanswered regarding the timing, duration, and types of adverse events that occur following administration of this vaccine.\nMETHODS: In 2012 and 2013, 264 LAIV doses were administered to 198 patients aged 2-19 with CF. Vaccinees were followed prospectively for 55 days after vaccination (day 0) and information on adverse events was collected. Bayesian change-point analysis was used to identify the risk period following LAIV during which participants had a higher risk of reporting adverse events. Multivariable zero-inflated Poisson regression models were then used to estimate the adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) and 95% credible interval (CrI) of reporting each adverse event in the risk period versus the control period.\nRESULTS: There was a higher risk of reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) (aIRR 1.45, 95% CrI (0.29, 5.17)) and solicited symptoms during days 0-6 of follow-up compared to control period days 7-55. However, most SAEs were not causally related to LAIV and the solicited symptom episodes were brief, usually lasting 1-2 days. There was no increased risk of antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory conditions in the risk vs. control periods (aIRR 0.48, 95% CrI (0.23, 0.91)).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adverse events were most common 0-6 days after LAIV administration but were generally benign and self-limiting. Pulmonary exacerbations did not increase in frequency."

            "title": "Routine molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness (ResPOC): a pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory virus infection is a common cause of hospitalisation in adults. Rapid point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses might improve clinical care by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, shortening length of hospital stay, improving influenza detection and treatment, and rationalising isolation facility use; however, insufficient evidence exists to support its use over standard clinical care. We aimed to assess the effect of routine POCT on a broad range of clinical outcomes including antibiotic use.\nMETHODS: In this pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years) within 24 h of presenting to the emergency department or acute medical unit of a large UK hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever higher than 37\u00b75\u00b0C (\u22647 days duration), or both, over two winter seasons. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based allocation sequence with random permuted blocks, to have a molecular POC test for respiratory viruses or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received antibiotics while hospitalised (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included duration of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving single doses or brief courses of antibiotics, length of stay, antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding patients who declined intervention or were withdrawn for protocol violations. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 90211642, and has been completed.\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2015, and April 30, 2015, and between Oct 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, we enrolled 720 patients (362 assigned to POCT and 358 to routine care). Six patients withdrew or had protocol violations. 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics compared with 294 (83%) of 354 controls (difference 0\u00b76%, 95% CI -4\u00b79 to 6\u00b70; p=0\u00b784). Mean duration of antibiotics did not differ between groups (7\u00b72 days [SD 5\u00b71] in the POCT group vs 7\u00b77 days [4\u00b79] in the control group; difference -0\u00b74, 95% CI -1\u00b72 to 0\u00b74; p=0\u00b732). 50 (17%) of 301 patients treated with antibiotics in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics (<48 h) compared with 26 (9%) of 294 patients in the control group (difference 7\u00b78%, 95% CI 2\u00b75 to 13\u00b71; p=0\u00b70047; number needed to test=13). Mean length of stay was shorter in the POCT group (5\u00b77 days [SD 6\u00b73]) than in the control group (6\u00b78 days [7\u00b77]; difference -1\u00b71, 95% CI -2\u00b72 to -0\u00b73; p=0\u00b70443). Appropriate antiviral treatment of influenza-positive patients was more common in the POCT group (52 [91%] of 57 patients) than in the control group (24 [65%] of 37 patients; difference 26\u00b74%, 95% CI 9\u00b76 to 43\u00b72; p=0\u00b70026; number needed to test=4). We found no differences in adverse outcomes between the groups (77 [21%] of 360 patients in the POCT group vs 88 [25%] of 354 patients in the control group; -3\u00b75%, -9\u00b77 to 2\u00b77; p=0\u00b729).\nINTERPRETATION: Routine use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. However, the primary outcome measure failed to capture differences in antibiotic use because many patients were started on antibiotics before the results of POCT could be made available. Although POCT was not associated with a reduction in the duration of antibiotics overall, more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than did patients in the control group. POCT was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use, and appeared to be safe.\nFUNDING: University of Southampton."

Disease burden due to influenza and other respiratory viral infections is reported on a population level, but clinical scores measuring individual changes in disease severity are urgently needed. Areas covered: We present a composite clinical score allowing individual patient data analyses of disease severity based on systematic literature review and WHO-criteria for uncomplicated and complicated disease. The 22-item ViVI Disease Severity Score showed a normal distribution in a pediatric cohort of 6073 children aged 0-18\u00a0years (mean age 3.13; S.D. 3.89; range: 0 to 18.79). Expert commentary: The ViVI Score was correlated with risk of antibiotic use as well as need for hospitalization and intensive care. The ViVI Score was used to track children with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus infections and is fully compliant with regulatory data standards. The ViVI Disease Severity Score mobile application allows physicians to measure disease severity at the point-of care thereby taking clinical trials to the next level."

According to study design, 3 visits were evaluated. On each visit the detailed medical examination, determination of individual symptoms' severity and course of disease were made. The dynamic evaluation of prescribed in routine clinical practice therapy of influenza and ARVI and cases of disease exacerbations with antibiotics concomitant therapy were assessed.\nRESULTS: For the first time in outpatient practice on a large population of adult patients the objective data were obtained and analyzed. This data relating to the timing of access to medical care of patients with influenza and ARVI depending on the age and the disease severity, dynamics of clinical picture of the disease, their outcomes, timing recovery, as well as ongoing drug therapy of ARVI and influenza, allowed to identify patterns of development and course of these diseases. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral drug Kagocel for treatment of ARVI and influenza was shown. This is reflected in the improvement of the clinical picture of the disease; reducing the number of patients with exacerbations, requiring the prescription of systemic antibiotics up to 1.5 times; the acceleration of regression of symptoms and recovery periods.\nCONCLUSION: This study allows increase the level of objective assessment of the beginning and course of influenza and other ARVIs in outpatient practice, to predict their course and outcome, and to improve the treatment."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza causes excessive hospitalizations and deaths. The study assessed the efficacy and safety of a clarithromycin-naproxen-oseltamivir combination for treatment of serious influenza.\nMETHODS: From February to April 2015, we conducted a prospective open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Adult patients hospitalized for A(H3N2) influenza were randomly assigned to a 2-day combination of clarithromycin 500\u00a0mg, naproxen 200\u00a0mg, and oseltamivir 75\u00a0mg twice daily, followed by 3\u00a0days of oseltamivir or to oseltamivir 75\u00a0mg twice daily without placebo for 5\u00a0days as a control method (1:1). The primary end point was 30-day mortality. The secondary end points were 90-day mortality, serial nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) virus titer, percentage of neuraminidase-inhibitor-resistant A(H3N2) virus (NIRV) quasispecies, pneumonia severity index (PSI), and duration of hospital stay.\nRESULTS: Among the 217 patients with influenza A(H3N2) enrolled, 107 were randomly assigned to the combination treatment. The median age was 80 years, and 53.5%\u00a0were men. Adverse events were uncommon. Ten patients died during the 30-day follow-up. The combination treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality (P\u00a0= .01), less frequent\u00a0high dependency unit admission (P\u00a0= .009), and shorter hospital stay (P\u00a0< .0001). The virus titer and PSI (days 1-3; P\u00a0< .01) and the NPA specimens with NIRV\u00a0quasispecies\u00a0\u2265 5%\u00a0(days\u00a01-2; P\u00a0< .01) were significantly lower in the combination treatment group. Multivariate analysis showed that combination treatment was the only independent factor associated with lower 30-day mortality (OR, 0.06; 95%\u00a0CI, 0.004-0.94; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Combination treatment reduced both 30- and 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay. Further study of the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of this combination treatment of severe influenza is warranted.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: BioMed Central; No.: ISRCTN11273879 DOI 10.1186/ISRCTN11273879; URL: www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN11273879."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythema migrans represents an early cutaneous and most common manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. Recommendations regarding pharmacological agents, dose and duration of treatment are subject of intense debate. This review aims to explore differences in efficacy and safety between pharmacological treatments and control treatment.\nMETHODS: To identify relevant studies, we will conduct a systematic literature search. We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. Eligible comparative studies need to (1) consider patients with a diagnosis of erythema migrans resulting from Lyme borreliosis and (2) compare different pharmacological agents against each other, against any other non-pharmacological treatment, placebo or no treatment. Two review authors will independently assess included studies for risk of bias according to the methods of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and related to specific study designs. We will address patient-relevant outcomes including clinical remission of cutaneous symptoms, any treatment-related adverse events, quality of life and progressive symptoms such as neuroborreliosis or Lyme carditis and flu-like symptoms. Provided that the identified trials are comparable in terms of clinical issues, combined estimates will be provided. Estimations of treatment effects will be calculated based on a random effects model. Heterogeneity will be evaluated based on I (2) and chi-square test. In case of significant heterogeneity, a pooled estimate will not be provided, but heterogeneity will be investigated on the basis of methodological and clinical study aspects. We plan subgroup analysis to reveal potential differences in the effect estimates between patient populations and treatment specifications. We will consider risk of bias using sensitivity analyses to decide whether to rely on the pooled estimates. The quality of a body of evidence for individual outcomes will be assessed using the GRADE approach.\nDISCUSSION: Benefits and harms of pharmacological treatment in erythema migrans have not yet been adequately assessed. This systematic review will evaluate and summarise available evidence addressing benefits and harms of different pharmacological treatments. In addition, this summary of clinical evidence will inform decision-making between clinicians and patients and will play an important part in patient care.\nPROSPERO: CRD42016037932."

            "abstract": "Preventive services can reduce the morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD) in children but are delivered unreliably. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 2 to 5 years with SCD, evaluating each child for 14 months and expecting that he/she should receive \u226575% of days covered by antibiotic prophylaxis, \u22651 influenza immunization, and \u22651 transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). We used logistic regression to quantify the relationship between ambulatory generalist and hematologist visits and preventive services delivery. Of 266 children meeting the inclusion criteria, 30% consistently filled prophylactic antibiotic prescriptions. Having \u22652 generalist, non-well child care visits or \u22652 hematologist visits was associated with more reliable antibiotic prophylaxis. Forty-one percent of children received \u22651 influenza immunizations. Children with \u22652 hematologist visits were most likely to be immunized (62% vs. 35% among children without a hematologist visit). Only 25% of children received \u22651 TCD. Children most likely to receive a TCD (42%) were those with \u22652 hematologist visits. One in 20 children received all 3 preventive services. Preventive services delivery to young children with SCD was inconsistent but associated with multiple visits to ambulatory providers. Better connecting children with SCD to hematologists and strengthening preventive care delivery by generalists are both essential."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir has been widely used to treat patients with influenza; however, its effects have been debated. Recently, a new meta-analysis on the controversial topic of oseltamivir's effectiveness found that the drug reduces the duration of influenza symptoms and the risk of hospitalization, while increasing the risk of nausea and vomiting. Unfortunately, the analysis did not include articles published in Chinese. Thus, we performed an updated meta-analysis by adding more studies in China.\nMETHODS: The terms 'oseltamivir,' 'influenza,' and 'effect' were used to search for publications in both English and Chinese. Only controlled clinical trials were included. We used the weighted mean difference (WMD) or relative risk (RR), together with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), to estimate the effects of oseltamivir.\nRESULTS: A total of 12 studies including 107 712 patients were eligible for analysis. Oseltamivir significantly reduced the duration of fever (WMD, -20.48; 95% CI, -28.43, -12.53) and influenza-like symptoms (WMD, -19.39; 95% CI, -32.94, -5.84). The rates of hospitalization (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68, 0.90), antibiotics usage (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42, 0.74), otitis media (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.93), and nonspecific complications (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35, 0.95) were significantly decreased among patients taking oseltamivir. No significant difference was observed with respect to the risk of adverse reactions.\nCONCLUSION: Oseltamivir can effectively alleviate the symptoms of influenza and reduce hospitalization, antibiotic usage, and the risk of otitis media without significantly increasing the rate of adverse drug reactions."

            "abstract": "The threat posed by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus emphasized the need for new influenza A virus vaccines inducing a broad cross-protective immune response for use in both humans and pigs. An effective and broad influenza vaccine for pigs would greatly benefit the pork industry and contribute to public health by diminishing the risk of emerging highly pathogenic reassortants. Current inactivated protein vaccines against swine influenza produce only short-lived immunity and have no efficacy against heterologous strains. DNA vaccines are a potential alternative with advantages such as the induction of cellular and humoral immunity, inherent safety and rapid production time. We have previously developed a DNA vaccine encoding selected influenza proteins of pandemic origin and demonstrated broad protective immune responses in ferrets and pigs. In this study, we evaluated our DNA vaccine expressed by next-generation vectors. These new vectors can improve gene expression, but they are also efficiently produced on large scales and comply with regulatory guidelines by avoiding antibiotic resistance genes. In addition, a new needle-free delivery of the vaccine, convenient for mass vaccinations, was compared with intradermal needle injection followed by electroporation. We report that when our DNA vaccine is expressed by the new vectors and delivered to the skin with the needle-free device in the rabbit model, it can elicit an antibody response with the same titers as a conventional vector with intradermal electroporation. The needle-free delivery is already in use for traditional protein vaccines in pigs but should be considered as a practical alternative for the mass administration of broadly protective influenza DNA vaccines."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.\nMETHODS: We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.\nFINDINGS: We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0\u00b779, 95% CI 0\u00b774-0\u00b785; p<0\u00b70001). The median times to alleviation were 97\u00b75 h for oseltamivir and 122\u00b77 h for placebo groups (difference -25\u00b72 h, 95% CI -36\u00b72 to -16\u00b70). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0\u00b785) but remained highly significant (median difference -17\u00b78 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0\u00b756, 95% CI 0\u00b742-0\u00b775; p=0\u00b70001; 4\u00b79% oseltamivir vs 8\u00b77% placebo, risk difference -3\u00b78%, 95% CI -5\u00b70 to -2\u00b72) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b717-0\u00b781; p=0\u00b7013; 0\u00b76% oseltamivir, 1\u00b77% placebo, risk difference -1\u00b71%, 95% CI -1\u00b74 to -0\u00b73). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1\u00b760, 95% CI 1\u00b729-1\u00b799; p<0\u00b70001; 9\u00b79% oseltamivir vs 6\u00b72% placebo, risk difference 3\u00b77%, 95% CI 1\u00b78-6\u00b71) and vomiting (RR 2\u00b743, 95% CI 1\u00b783-3\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001; 8\u00b70% oseltamivir vs 3\u00b73% placebo, risk difference 4\u00b77%, 95% CI 2\u00b77-7\u00b73). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.\nINTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.\nFUNDING: Multiparty Group for Advice on Science (MUGAS) foundation."

            "abstract": "A latency period preceding neurotoxicity is a common characteristic in the dose-response relationship induced by organic mercury. Latency periods have typically been observed with genotoxicants in carcinogenesis, with cancer being manifested a long time after the initiating event. These observations indicate that even a very small dose may cause extensive adverse effects later in life, so the toxicity of the genotoxic compound is dose and time-dependent. In children, methylmercury exposure during pregnancy (in utero) has been associated with delays in reaching developmental milestones (e.g., age at first walking) and decreases in intelligence, increasing in severity with increasing exposure. Ethylmercury exposure from thimerosal in some vaccines has been associated, in some studies, with autism and other neurological disorders in children. In this paper, we have examined whether dose-response data from in vitro and in vivo organic mercury toxicity studies fit the Druckrey-K\u00fcpfm\u00fcller equation c\u00b7t(n)=constant (c=exposure concentration, t=latency period), first established for genotoxic carcinogens, and whether or not irreversible effects are enhanced by time of exposure (n\u22651), or else toxic effects are dose-dependent while time has only minor influence on the adverse outcome (n<1). The mode of action underlying time-dependent toxicity is irreversible binding to critical receptors causing adverse and cumulative effects. The results indicate that the Druckrey-K\u00fcpfm\u00fcller equation describes well the dose-response characteristics of organic mercury induced neurotoxic effects. This amounts to a paradigm shift in chemical risk assessment of mercurial compounds and highlights that it is vital to perform toxicity testing geared to investigate time-dependent effects."

The authors hypothesised that MMR vaccine may have been responsible for the bowel dysfunction which subsequently resulted in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The suggestion that measles vaccine may cause autism through a persistent bowel infection generated much interest since it provided a possible biological mechanism for a causal association. Epidemiological studies, however, have not found an association between MMR vaccination and autism. Autism has a strong genetic component and its associated neurological defects probably occur during embryonic development. It seems unlikely that a vaccination that is given after birth could cause autism. In a minority of cases, autism may have onset after 1 year of age (regressive autism) but the one epidemiological study that included such cases did not find an association with MMR vaccination. Currently, the weight of the available epidemiological and related evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Australian prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) provide information about a patient's recent medication history for controlled drugs at the point of prescribing and dispensing. Despite their increasing use, the evidence for PDMPs is mixed, and is almost exclusively from the United States. This study examined the impact of PDMP implementation on opioid prescribing among general practitioners in Victoria, Australia.\nMETHOD: We examined data on analgesic prescribing using electronic records of 464 medical practices in the Australian state of Victoria between 01/04/2017 and 31/12/ 2020. We used interrupted time series analyses, to examine immediate and longer-term trends in medication prescribing following voluntary (from April 2019) and mandatory PDMP implementation (from April 2020). We examined changes in three outcomes (i) 'high' opioid dose (50-100mg oral morphine equivalent daily dose (OMEDD) and over 100mg (OMEDD) prescribing (ii) prescribing of high-risk medication combinations (opioids with either benzodiazepines or pregabalin), and (iii) initiation of non-controlled pain medications (tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin and tramadol).\nRESULTS: We found no effect of voluntary or mandatory PDMP implementation on 'high-dose' opioid prescribing with reductions only seen in those prescribed <20mg OMEDD (i.e., the lowest dose category). Co-prescribing of opioids with benzodiazepines (additional 11.87 [95%CI 2.04 to 21.67] patients/10,000 and pregabalin (additional 3.54 [95% CI 0.82 to 6.26] patients/10,000 increased following mandatory PDMP implementation among those prescribed opioids. In contrast to trends of reduced initiation prior to PDMP implementation, we found increased new initiation of non-monitored medications following PDMP implementation (e.g., an immediate increase of 2.32 [95%CI 0.02 to 4.54], patients/10,000 received pregabalin and 3.06 [95%CI 0.54 to 5.5] patients/10,000 received tricyclic antidepressants after mandatory PDMP implementation), and increased tramadol initiation during the voluntary PDMP period (an increase of 11.26 [95%CI: 5.84, 16.67] patients /10,000).\nCONCLUSION: PDMP implementation did not appear to reduce prescribing of high opioid doses or high-risk combinations. Increased initiation of tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin and tramadol may indicate a possible unintended effect."

            "title": "Prescription of Controlled Substances: Benefits and Risks",
            "abstract": "None: One of the most difficult challenges for any prescriber is distinguishing between the legitimate prescription of controlled substances versus the prescription potentially used for illegitimate purposes. To discern the difference, prescribers need to understand the signs, symptoms, and treatment of acute and chronic pain and the signs and symptoms of patients misusing controlled substances. A common reason people seek\u00a0the care of medical professionals is pain relief. While many categories of pain medications are available, opioid analgesics are FDA-approved for moderate to severe pain. As such, they are a common choice for patients with acute, cancer-related, neurologic, and end-of-life pain. Prescribing opioid analgesics for chronic pain is controversial and fraught with inconclusive standards. In the 1990s, due to the chronic failure of health professionals to treat severe pain appropriately,\u00a0opioid analgesic prescribing was expanded. Unfortunately, this led to increased overuse, diversion of drugs, opioid use disorder, and overdose. The \"Catch-22\" seems to be either\u00a0health professionals undertreat, and there is needless suffering, or they overtreat, with the potential to cause adverse effects like\u00a0increased opioid analgesic use disorder and potential overdose. The prescribing of opioid analgesics peaked in 2011. Since then, both prescribing and overdose have been declining, yet as a society, in both the lay and scientific literature, there are grave concerns that\u00a0we are still in the middle of an opioid crisis. Perhaps the biggest challenge of caring for patients with pain is that individuals have different tolerance levels and require variable opioid doses to obtain adequate pain relief. Patients may have a range of behavioral, cultural, emotional, and psychologic responses to pain versus a substance use disorder; often, it is challenging to tell the difference. All health professionals engaged in pain management need an understanding of the treatment recommendations and safety concerns in prescribing opioid analgesics. Appropriate opioid prescribing requires a thorough patient assessment, short and long-term treatment planning, close follow-up, and continued monitoring. All providers need to be aware of appropriate patient assessment and treatment planning and the possibility of use disorder, diversion, and potentially dangerous behavioral responses to controlled substances, e.g., opioid analgesics differ from pseudoaddiction and physical dependence. It is clear that many clinicians know little about opioid use disorder. They do not understand it is a disease, and many believe opioid dependence is the same as opioid use disorder. Lack of a clear understanding results in clinicians confusing a patient with chronic non-use disorder with the one misusing their prescribed opioid. Lack of training and educational deficits often interfere with the appropriate\u00a0prescription of opioid analgesic agents. To prevent the misuse of controlled substances, providers that prescribe controlled substances should learn prescribing practices that\u00a0minimize or prevent adverse consequences. Definitions:  Addiction - according to the\u00a0American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM): \"Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry. Dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social, and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward or relief by substance use and other behaviors.\" Addiction is now termed \"use disorder\" and is characterized by an inability to consistently abstain, craving the drug, impairment in behavioral control, diminished ability to recognize significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, use disorder often involves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in recovery activities, use disorder is progressive and can result in disability or premature death.\"\u00a0\u00a0: Appropriate opioid analgesic prescribing: This involves providing pain control while minimizing toxicity, use disorder, or the risk of use disorder and implementing safeguards to reduce drug diversion. Inappropriate opioid analgesic prescribing: non-prescribing, inadequate prescribing, excessive prescribing, or continued prescribing despite evidence of the lack of effective\u00a0opioid analgesic treatment. Controlled substances: These are drugs or medications that possess the potential for being misused and are\u00a0considered to be substances that have a substantially high risk of resulting in substance use disorder. Opioid analgesics:\u00a0these are drugs that dull the senses and relieve pain, e.g., morphine. Also, these medications may\u00a0induce sleep. Please note that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA, USA) uses the term \"narcotic\" to refer to drugs that are opioid analgesics. Five Characteristics of Addiction/Use Disorder (ASAM):  1. Craving for drugs or rewards. 2. Diminished recognition of significant problems in one's behavior. 3. Dysfunctional emotional response. 4. Impairment in behavioral control. 5. Inability to consistently abstain\u00a0. Drug Schedules of Controlled Substances All providers should be familiar with the guidelines and laws for each schedule, which have, as their basis, the purpose of the drug and the risk of use disorder. In the United States, controlled substances are under strict regulation by both federal and state laws that guide their manufacture and distribution. Controlled substances have a high risk of resulting in addiction and substance use disorder. As the schedules decrease, I-V,\u00a0the drugs listed\u00a0within each category have a lower potential to cause a substance use or\u00a0addiction disorder.\u00a0 Controlled Substance Act In the United States, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was passed in 1970, and it included the\u00a0Controlled Substance Act. The Controlled Substance Act covers drug: Classification and regulation, according to their content and purpose. Manufacturing. Distribution. Exportation and sale. The Controlled Substance Act established five drug schedules and classified them to control their manufacture and\u00a0distribution. Part of the regulation requires providers prescribing scheduled drugs and pharmacists filling them to obtain a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Health professionals' licenses include specific license numbers allowing controlled substance prescriptions to be tracked and linked to a particular provider or distributor. Each of the five schedules has parameters based on their medical value, the risk of addiction, and the ability to cause harm. The schedules range from Schedule I (most potential for addiction/use disorder) to Schedule V (least potential for addiction/use disorder). Schedule I:  Schedule I drugs possess the highest potential for use disorder and misuse. They\u00a0have no medical use and are illicit or \"street\" drugs. Examples of Schedule I drugs include heroin, lysergic acid\u00a0diethylamide, mescaline, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and methaqualone. Marijuana, which is legal in some states, is still classified as a\u00a0Schedule I drug at the federal level as of this writing. Schedule II:  Schedule II drugs have a reduced potential for use disorders than Schedule I. They are at high risk for both physical and psychological dependence. They have a high capacity for both use disorder and misuse.\u00a0They are typically prescribed to treat severe pain, anxiety,\u00a0insomnia, and ADHD. Examples of Schedule II substances include\u00a0fentanyl, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, methamphetamine, pentobarbital,\u00a0and secobarbital. They previously had to be prescribed only via paper prescription but now are permitted to be electronically transmitted. (Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances or EPCS). No refills are allowed.\u00a0. Schedule II drugs have the tightest regulations when\u00a0compared to other prescription drugs. Schedule III:  Schedule III drugs have a lower misuse potential than I and II. Drugs in this category\u00a0may cause\u00a0physical dependence but more commonly lead to psychological\u00a0dependence. Medications in this category are often used for pain control, or anesthesia, or appetite suppression. Examples of Schedule III substances include benzphetamine, ketamine, phendimetrazine, and anabolic steroids. Opioid analgesics in this schedule include products containing not more than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit and buprenorphine. Schedule III drugs are prescribable verbally over the phone, with a paper prescription, or via EPCS. Within a six-month time frame, refill requirements are such that the drug can only have five refills.\u00a0. Schedule IV:  Schedule IV drugs have an even lower misuse potential than I, II, or III. They have a limited risk of physical or psychological dependence. Examples of Schedule IV substances include: alprazolam, carisoprodol, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, temazepam, tramadol, and triazolam. Drugs in this class may be utilized for pain control as\u00a0long as the provider deems the drug medically necessary and the patient would benefit. Schedule IV drugs are prescribable verbally over the phone, with a paper prescription, or via EPCS. Refills are permitted up to five times in a six-month\u00a0timeframe from the issuance date. Schedule V:  Schedule V drugs are the least likely of the controlled substances to be misused.\u00a0They result in very limited physical or psychological dependence. Examples include cough medicines with codeine, antidiarrheal medications that contain\u00a0atropine/diphenoxylate, pregabalin, and ezogabine. Despite their low abuse potential, they still need to be managed appropriately and administered with care. When they contain codeine, it must have less than 200 mg of codeine\u00a0per 100 mL. Partial prescription fills cannot occur more than\u00a0six months after the issue date. When a partial fill occurs, it is treated in the\u00a0same manner and with the same rules as a refill of the drug. Drug Use Disorder, Abuse, and Misuse The use disorder of a drug differs from abuse and misuse\u00a0of a drug. The drugs taken may be illicit street or stolen drugs or obtained via a legal prescription. Misusing a drug usually involves taking the drug in a harmful or detrimental way, resulting in personal, professional, or social problems. A patient abusing an opioid analgesic may no longer be appropriately interacting with their family or friends or be able to perform their duties at work. Misuse of a controlled substance refers to using a prescribed drug in a way that was not\u00a0intended. It may be deliberate or accidental. A negative result may or may not occur. Examples of misuse include taking too much of a drug, using an incorrect dose, an incorrect route, or using prescription drugs written for another person. Controlled substances include both prescription drugs and illicit drugs with no recognized medical value. Both have the potential to be abused or misused. While Schedule I drug use is illegal, prescription drugs found in Schedules II-V are also commonly abused and misused, and their misuse is a challenging problem that has increased over the last several years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared prescription drug abuse a problem of epidemic\u00a0proportions. The CDC believes that absent checks and balances on the prescription and distribution of controlled substances, including those prescribed for\u00a0medical use, have the potential for abuse and that misuse will continue to\u00a0increase. Prescriber\u00a0Shopping Unfortunately, a common practice among those who deliberately misuse controlled substances is to seek out\u00a0multiple sources of drugs. They do this by seeing different health care providers and presenting with a list of complaints that are often fictitious and different for each provider. The patient may be able to\u00a0obtain multiple prescriptions\u00a0and then fill them at different pharmacies. Many states have enacted systems that allow providers to see all of the prescriptions written for each patient. The use of these systems is gradually curbing \"prescriber shopping.\" Diversion Some prescription drugs will sell on the street for as much as $50 a tablet.\u00a0Diversion is when a patient sells their drugs as a method of earning money. Drugs may also be sold to buy food, pay expenses, or purchase more potent street drugs. Worse, in some cases, healthcare providers may divert drugs from patients\u00a0for the providers' personal use\u00a0or sell them to someone else. Some individuals use controlled substances in ways for which they were not originally intended. Rather than pain control, they may be used to stay awake, induce sleep, or get \"high.\" Before the popularity of prescription drug diversion, the only method to obtain illicit drugs was to import from other countries or manufacture them in private labs. Today, law enforcement agencies have the tremendous challenge of dealing with prescription drugs sold by diversion and illicit drugs imported or manufactured. In both instances, these drug sales and usage result in increased criminal activity, dangerous overdoses, and death.\u00a0 Methods of Obtaining Prescription Drugs A review of multiple studies demonstrates a variety of ways individuals obtain prescription drugs. The following summarizes the studies' findings. 55% free from a friend or relative. 20% from a prescriber. 10% purchased from a friend or relative. 5% stolen from a friend or relative. 5% purchased from a drug dealer. 2% from multiple doctors. 1% from theft from medical practice or pharmacy. Less than 1% obtain them from the internet. Studies also reveal the source of the majority of these drugs was a single legal prescriber. Provider Opioid Knowledge Deficit\u00a0 There are substantial knowledge gaps around appropriate and inappropriate opioid analgesic prescribing, including deficits in understanding current research, legislation, and appropriate prescribing practices. Providers often have knowledge deficits that include: Understanding of addiction. At-risk opioid addiction populations. Prescription vs. non-prescription opioid addiction. The belief that addiction and dependence on opioids are synonymous. The belief that opioid addiction is a psychological problem instead related to a chronic painful disease. With a long history of misunderstanding, poor society, provider education, and inconsistent laws, prescribing opioids has resulted in significant societal challenges that will only be resolved with significant education and training. Misuse of Controlled Substances Unfortunately, the misuse of controlled substances resulting in morbidity and mortality is rampant.\u00a0According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2016, performed by the US Department of Health and Human Services, over 10 million people misuse prescription pain medications, and over 2 million misuse sedatives, stimulants, and tranquilizers each year. The same study found that the most common reason for misuse is for treating physical pain. The Centers for Disease Control estimates more than 40,000 people die each year from an opioid overdose.\u00a0 Controlled Substances Three common classes of controlled substances are commonly misused: opioids, depressants, and stimulants.\u00a0 Opioids Opioids are prescribed for pain control by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system reducing pain signals to the brain as well as receptors in the GI tract and respiratory system, and are used to treat pain, diarrhea, and cough. Common Opioids Codeine -\u00a0One of the most commonly taken opioid medications. It is at the center of the opioid addiction problem in the United States and thus is highly regulated. Its main indications\u00a0are pain and cough. FDA-Approved Indication Pain Codeine plays a role in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Its use is recognized in chronic pain due to ongoing cancer and palliative care. However, the use of codeine to treat other types of chronic pain remains controversial. Chronic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain, is pain persisting beyond the standard tissue healing time, which is three months.[1] The most prevalent causes of non-cancer chronic pain include back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and headache. Non-FDA Approved Indications Cough Codeine is useful in the treatment of various etiologies producing chronic cough. Also, 46% of patients with chronic cough do not have a distinct etiology despite a proper diagnostic evaluation. Codeine produces a decrease in cough frequency and severity in these patients. However, there is limited literature demonstrating the efficacy of codeine in chronic cough. The dose can vary from 15 mg to 120 mg a day. It is, however, indicated in the management of prolonged cough (in specific populations like lung cancer) usually as 30 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Restless Leg Syndrome Codeine is effective in treating restless leg syndrome when given at night time, especially for those whose symptoms are not relieved by other medications. Persistent Diarrhea (Palliative) Codeine and loperamide are equally effective, and the choice between them has its basis in the assessment of the physician evaluating the small but undoubted addictive potential of codeine versus the higher cost of loperamide and an individual difference in patient's vulnerability to adverse effects. Fentanyl -\u00a0Transdermal patch and IV, commonly abused and used in mixture with other drugs. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 80\u00a0to 100 times stronger than morphine and is often added to heroin to increase its potency. It can cause severe respiratory depression and death, particularly when mixed with other drugs or alcohol. It has high addiction potential. Hydrocodone -\u00a0Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain. Immediate-release (IR) hydrocodone is available as a combination product (combined with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.) and is FDA approved for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative (non-opioid) treatments are inadequate. Single-entity hydrocodone is only available in extended-release (ER) formulations. It is FDA approved to treat persistent pain severe enough to require 24-hour, long-term opioid treatment, for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Hydrocodone is also an antitussive and is indicated for cough in adults. Morphine Sulfate -\u00a0FDA-approved usage of morphine sulfate includes moderate to severe pain that may be acute or chronic. Most commonly used in pain management, morphine provides significant relief to patients afflicted with pain. Clinical situations that significantly benefit from medicating with morphine include managing palliative/end-of-life care, active cancer treatment, and vaso-occlusive pain during sickle cell crises. Morphine is widely used off-label for almost any condition that causes pain. In the emergency department, morphine is given for musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis, and even headaches when patients fail to respond to first and second-line agents. Morphine is rarely used for procedural sedation. However, clinicians will sometimes combine a low dose of morphine with a low dose of benzodiazepine-like lorazepam for minor procedures. Oxycodone -\u00a0An opioid agonist prescription medication. The oxycodone immediate-release formulation is FDA-approved for managing acute or chronic moderate to severe pain for which other treatments do not suffice, and for which opioid medication is appropriate. The extended-release formulation is FDA-approved for the management of pain severe enough to require continuous (24 hours per day), long-term opioid treatment, and for which there are no alternative options to treat the pain. The oxycodone to morphine dose equivalent ratio is approximately 1 to 1.5 for immediate-release and 1 to 2 for extended-release formulations. Tramadol -\u00a0Tramadol is an FDA-approved medication for pain relief. It has specific indications for moderate to severe pain. It is considered a class IV drug by the FDA. Due to possible abuse and addiction potential, limitations to its use should be for pain that is refractive to other pain medication, such as non-opioid pain medication. There are two forms of tramadol: extended-release and immediate release. The immediate release is not for use as an \"as needed\" medication; instead, it is for pain of less than a week duration. For pain lasting more than a week, extended-release is the therapeutic choice \u2014 the indication for extended-release is for pain control under 24-hour management or an extended period. Off-label, the drug is useful for premature ejaculation and restless leg syndrome refractory to other medications. For the off-label use of tramadol for premature ejaculation, both sporadic and daily use is effective for treating the condition. Patients indicate a preference for \"as needed\" therapy for premature ejaculation due to the lack of side effects compared to the daily use of tramadol. Addiction, Dependence, and Tolerance While each of these terms is similar, providers should be aware of the differences. Addiction - the constant need for a drug despite harmful consequences. Pseudoaddiction - constant fear of being in pain, hypervigilance; usually, there is a resolution with pain resolution. Dependence - physical adaptation to a medication where it is necessary for normal function and withdrawal occurs with lack of the medication. Tolerance - lack of expected response to a medication increasing dose to achieve the same pain relief resulting from CNS adaptation to the medication over time. Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and will integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.\u00a0 As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if permitted by applicable state law, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers who were registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed on the part of registrants. There are no longer any limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine. Separate tracking of patients treated with buprenorphine or prescriptions written is no longer required.\u00a0 Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescribing authority's DEA number and does not need a DATA 2000 waiver from the prescriber. However, depending on the pharmacy, the dispensing software may still require the X-Waiver information in order to proceed.

            "title": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), pain and aging: Adjusting prescription to patient features.",
            "abstract": "A narrative review of papers published from January 2011 to December 2021, after a literature search in selected databases using the terms \"pharmacokinetics\", \"ibuprofen\", \"diclofenac\", \"acemetacin\", \"naproxen\", \"etodolac\" and \"etoricoxib\" was performed. From 828 articles identified, only eight met the inclusion criteria. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with higher cardiovascular risk, while non-selective COX inhibitors are associated with higher gastrointestinal risk. NSAIDs with lower renal excretion with phase 2 metabolism are less likely to induce adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Patients with frequent NSAID use needs, such as elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular disease or impaired renal function, will benefit from lower renal excretion (e.g. acemethacin, diclofenac, and etodolac) (level of evidence 3). Polymedicated patients, elderly patients, and patients with chronic alcohol abuse will be at a lower risk for adverse effects with NSAIDs that undergo phase 2 liver biotransformation, namely, acemethacin and diclofenac (level of evidence 3). Young patients, patients dealing with acute pain, or with active and/or chronic symptomatic gastritis, selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib or etoricoxib) may be a better option (level of evidence 2). Knowing the individual characteristics of the patients, combined with knowledge on basic pharmacology, offers greater safety and better adherence to therapy. PERSPECTIVE: Although there are several NSAIDs options to treat pain, physicians usually take special care to its prescription regarding cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects, despite the age of the patient. In this paper, based on the best evidence, the authors present a review of the safest NSAIDs to use in the elderly."

            "title": "Supervised dosing with a long-acting opioid medication in the management of opioid dependence.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Opioid dependence (OD) is an increasing clinical and public health problem worldwide. International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first-line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off-site consumption.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off-site consumption.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/).All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references on topic-related systematic reviews.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS: Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes.We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow-up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self-reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence).Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low-quality evidence), while in the cohort study all-cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person-years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27).No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid-related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Take-home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take-home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow-up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence."

            "title": "Improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: a randomized controlled trial.",
            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The use of opioid analgesics in the United States has significantly increased in recent years. However, there is minimal consensus on what discharge counseling should accompany these high-risk prescriptions and large variations in what is done in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dual-modality (written and spoken) literacy-appropriate educational strategy on patients' knowledge of and safe use of opioid analgesics.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive discharged patients at an urban academic ED (>88,000 visits) with new prescriptions for hydrocodone-acetaminophen were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care or the educational intervention. The educational intervention was a one-page information sheet about hydrocodone-acetaminophen, which was both given to the patients and read aloud by the research assistant (nonblinded). Follow-up phone calls were conducted 4 to 7 days after the visit to assess patient knowledge about the medication and self-report of activities associated with safety of use (e.g., double-dipping with acetaminophen, storage, use with alcohol or while driving).\nRESULTS: A total of 274 patients were enrolled; 210 completed follow-up (110 usual care and 100 intervention). No significant differences in baseline characteristics emerged between the study arms; 42% were male, and 51% were white, with a median age of 43 years. Half of patients had non-back pain orthopedic injuries (49.5%). On follow-up, overall knowledge was poor, with only 28% able to name both active ingredients in the medication. The intervention group had better knowledge of precautions related to taking additional acetaminophen (usual care 18.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.9% to 25.5% vs. intervention 38%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 47.7%; difference = 27.6, 95% CI of difference = 21.5 to 33.7) and knowledge of side effects (usual care median = 1, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 2 vs. intervention median = 2, IQR = 1 to 2; p < 0.0001). Additionally, those who received the intervention were less likely to have reported driving within 6 hours after taking hydrocodone (usual care 13.6%, 95% CI = 7.2% to 20% vs. intervention 3%, 95% CI = -0.3% to 6.3%; difference = 10.6, 95% CI of difference = 3.4 to 17.9). There was no difference between groups related to knowledge about drinking alcohol while taking hydrocodone (overall 18.1%) or knowledge that the opioid could be addictive (overall 72.4%).\nCONCLUSIONS: This simple strategy improved several, but not all, aspects of patient knowledge and resulted in fewer patients in the intervention arm driving while taking hydrocodone. Integration of a patient education document into conversations about opioids holds promise for improving patient knowledge about these high-risk medications."

            "title": "Topical review on the abuse and misuse potential of tramadol and tilidine in Germany.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tramadol and tilidine (in combination with naloxone) are used as weak opioid analgesics in Germany. Tramadol is not scheduled in the German Narcotic Drugs Act. Tilidine is scheduled, whereas Tilidine in fixed combinations with naloxone is exempt from some of the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs Act. Recent reports on misuse of both substances led to an evaluation of their potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency by the expert advisory committee established by the German Federal Government, resident at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.\nMETHODS: A subcommittee formulated key questions and identified available data sources for each of these questions. Additional information was solicited where necessary, including a survey among a panel of pharmacists, a survey in an addiction clinic, analysis of prescription patterns, and information from the boards of pharmacists of the federal states and the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\nRESULTS: Analgesic efficiency in the treatment of acute and chronic pain has been proven for both tramadol and tilidine/naloxone. For tramadol, high evidence has been confirmed in systematic reviews, and tramadol is listed in national and international guidelines on acute and chronic pain management. Animal and human studies found a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency for both substances. Information from 2 tramadol safety databases allowed calculation of the incidence of abuse or dependency as 0.21 and 0.12 cases per million defined daily dosages (DDDs), with lower incidences in recent years. For tilidine/naloxone, the incidence was calculated as 0.43 cases per million DDDs for oral solution and 0.18 for slow-release tablets. In an online survey among German pharmacies as well as in the reports from state pharmacy boards, fraud attempts were repeated more frequently with tilidine/naloxone than with tramadol in the last 2 years. The Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigations reported prescription fraud only with tilidine/naloxone and predominantly in the region of Berlin. Dependency on tramadol or tilidine/naloxone is reported only rarely from addiction counseling centers. One third of the patients surveyed in an addiction clinic reported experiences with tramadol or tilidine/naloxone, but mostly with duration of less than 4 weeks and with a medical prescription based on a reasonable indication. Also, occasional illegal use of opioid analgesics as a substitute of heroin was reported. An evaluation of pooled data from statutory health insurance companies found 2.5% of persons receiving at least 1 prescription of tramadol or the combination of tilidine and naloxone in 2009 (1.6% with tramadol and 1.0% with tilidine/naloxone). High usage with more than 180 DDDs per year was found in 8.6% of patients treated with tramadol and 17.2% of patients with tilidine/naloxone.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the subcommittee of the expert advisory committee found a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency for tramadol, and a low prevalence in clinical practice. Considerable less information is available for the combination of tilidine and naloxone. However, the cumulation of evidence indicated a higher risk of misuse, abuse, and dependency for tilidine/naloxone solution, but not for slow-release tablets."

            "abstract": "Self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is an economical choice of treatment for common self-limiting illnesses. As more medications are made available as OTC drugs, and as the population of older adults continues to increase, a need arises to monitor how elderly individuals use these agents. The purpose of this study was to assess the self-medication practices with OTC drugs among older adults. The study took place in a city in North Carolina in apartments managed by the city's Housing Authority and a private physician's office. Participants included 39 adults ages 59 to 91. Respondents lived independently, used OTC drugs, and were responsible for their health care decisions. Conn's Self-Medication Practice Tool was used to assess symptoms the older adults were treating with OTC drugs; therapeutic categories of OTC drugs used; frequency of OTC drugs used; and the use of alcohol, prescription drugs, and caffeine. The respondents reported pain as the symptom most frequently self-treated with OTC drugs. Ninety percent of the respondents used pain medicine, and approximately two thirds (67%) of the respondents used at least one high blood pressure medicine. More than half of the respondents (59%) used caffeine daily, and 10% used alcohol. The researchers concluded that older adults might be unaware of the adverse risks associated with concurrent use of pain medicines, alcohol, high blood pressure drugs, and regular caffeine use. This makes it necessary for all nurses and other clinicians providing health care to older adults to intensify efforts to educate and guard these patients and ensure appropriate use of OTC drugs."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of prescribing of methadone tablets and syrup in South Australia by investigating overdose deaths of patients using prescribed methadone and non-patients using illegally obtained methadone.\nDESIGN: Surveillance study of deaths related to methadone overdose, 1984-1994.\nDATA SOURCES: Coroner's Office and the Therapeutic Goods Section of the South Australian Health Commission.\nRESULTS: Per capita prescription of methadone tablets for chronic pain in South Australia was the highest in Australia in 1994. A large increase in deaths, due mainly to methadone tablets prescribed for chronic pain, occurred in 1993-1994. Illegal diversion of methadone to non-patients was responsible for half of the deaths during these two years. Deaths from overdoses of methadone syrup prescribed in maintenance therapy for drug dependence declined from 1984 to 1994. The relative risk for patient deaths due to methadone tablets versus methadone syrup was estimated to be 7.29 (95% confidence limits, 2.15-31.48). Psychotropic drug combinations were present in 86% of deaths.\nCONCLUSION: The methadone syrup program for drug dependence remains relatively safe. Our data raise concerns about prescribing methadone tablets for chronic pain. Better prescriber education and accountability, patient assessment and supervision and advice to patients about concurrent use of alcohol and benzodiazepines are needed."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The introduction of the varicella vaccine has led to a significant decrease in pediatric varicella-induced invasive Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcal [GAS]) infections. However, the development of a pleural empyema following a chickenpox infection is a rare complication in pediatric patients.\nCASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present a 5-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department with a deteriorating course two days after a chickenpox infection. The patient complained of high-grade documented fever, a congested throat, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and most importantly, decreased air entry on the right side of the chest, along with the presence of crepitations. Such a deteriorated clinical picture suggested the presence of an infectious cause. The patient's physical examination and radiological imaging provided evidence for the presence of lower right-sided lobar pneumonia. On the second day of hospitalization, the patient showed worsening respiratory distress, prompting further investigations that confirmed the development of a right-sided pleural empyema through radiological imaging. Pediatric surgery consultation was requested, and 500 cc of pus was drained following the insertion of a chest tube, which was later sent for analysis. The patient's clinical picture improved significantly following this intervention. Due to the severity of his condition, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for close monitoring. After one night in the PICU, during which his condition stabilized and oxygen therapy was gradually weaned off, the patient continued to improve on the general ward. Daily assessments and laboratory tests showed decreasing inflammatory markers and resolution of symptoms. Following three days of admission and confirmation of no underlying immunologic deficiency, the patient was discharged home with appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow-up instructions.\nDISCUSSION: Similar cases have been sporadically documented in pediatric literature, with notable examples involving older patients. The pathophysiology involves complex immune interactions and virulence factors of GAS, contributing to severe outcomes such as pleural effusion.\nCONCLUSION: In this case, the 5-year-old patient experienced a severe progression from chickenpox to pleural empyema but ultimately improved following prompt medical intervention and chest tube drainage. The patient was discharged after a successful recovery, highlighting the efficacy of early recognition and treatment in managing such complications."

            "abstract": "The human pathobiont Streptococcus pyogenes forms biofilms and causes infections, such as pharyngotonsillitis and necrotizing fasciitis. Bacterial biofilms are more resilient to antibiotic treatment, and new therapeutic strategies are needed to control biofilm-associated infections, such as recurrent pharyngotonsillitis. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus are two bacterial commensals used for their probiotic properties. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-biofilm properties of L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus cell-free supernatants (LPSN and LRSN, respectively) on S. pyogenes biofilms grown in vitro in supplemented minimal medium. When planktonic or biofilm S. pyogenes were exposed to LPSN or LRSN, S. pyogenes survival was reduced significantly in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effect was more pronounced on preformed biofilms. Enzymatic digestion of LPSN and LRSN suggested that glycolipid compounds might cause the antimicrobial effect. In conclusion, this study indicates that L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus produce glycolipid bioactive compounds that reduce the viability of S. pyogenes in planktonic and biofilm cultures.IMPORTANCEStreptococcus pyogenes infections are a significant concern for populations at risk, such as children and the elderly, as non-invasive conditions such as impetigo and strep throat can lead to severe invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis. Despite its susceptibility to current antibiotics, the formation of biofilm by this pathogen decreases the efficacy of antibiotic treatment alone. The ability of commensal lactobacillus to kill S. pyogenes has been documented by previous studies using in vitro settings. The relevance of our study is in using a physiological setup and a more detailed understanding of the nature of the lactobacillus molecule affecting the viability of S. pyogenes. This additional knowledge will help for a better comprehension of the molecules' characteristics and kinetics, which in turn will facilitate new avenues of research for its translation to new therapies."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bacterial etiologies of acute otitis media (AOM) have shifted from the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), antibiotic selection and competition among species. We characterized Streptococcus pneumoniae ( Spn ), Haemophilus influenzae ( Hflu ) and Moraxella catarrhalis ( Mcat ) in the nasopharynx during well-child healthy visits and at the onset of AOM, and in middle ear fluid (MEF) of children with AOM to assess anticipated effects of higher-valency PCVs (PCV15 and PCV20).\nMETHODS: From September 2021 to September 2023, we conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort study of PCV13 immunized children 6-36 months old. MEF was collected via tympanocentesis. Serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed on Spn , Hflu and Mcat isolates.\nRESULTS: We obtained 825 nasopharyngeal and 216 MEF samples from 301 children. The order of frequency of nasopharyngeal colonization was Mcat , Spn and Hflu ; Hflu was the predominant otopathogen in MEF. Among Spn isolates, non-PCV15, non-PCV20 serotypes predominated in the nasopharynx and in MEF; the most frequent serotype was 35B. Among MEF samples, 30% of Spn isolates were amoxicillin nonsusceptible; 23% of Hflu isolates and 100% of Mcat isolates were \u03b2-lactamase-producing.\nCONCLUSION: The majority of Spn isolates among young children were non-PCV15, non-PCV20 serotypes, especially serotype 35B; therefore, the impact of higher-valency PCVs in reducing pneumococcal colonization or AOM is expected to be limited. Hflu continues to be the most frequent AOM pathogen. Antibiotic susceptibility data suggest a high dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate or alternative drugs that are effective against contemporary mix of otopathogens could be considered for optimal empiric selection to provide the best efficacy."

In case of bacterial etiologies of the disease, penicillin antibiotics are prescribed, in particular amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. Dispersible forms of antibiotics have a number of advantages over film-coated tablets and are characterized by better pharmacokinetic parameters that increase the effectiveness and safety of treatment, as well as patient compliance.\nAIM: To compare the effectiveness and safety of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS in the form of dispersible tablets and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid in film-coated tablets in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized comparative clinical study involved 60 adult patients diagnosed with acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis. Group 1 (n=30) received the Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS, dispersible tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. Group 2 (n=30) received Amoxiclav, film-coated tablets, 875+125 mg 2 times a day at the beginning of meals. The duration of the treatment was 10 days. The following procedures were performed to all participants: general clinical and otorhinolaryngological examinations, an express test to detect group A streptococcal antigens in a smear from the posterior pharyngeal wall (streptatest), assessment of symptoms of acute tonsillopharyngitis on the McIsaac scale, severity of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, swelling of the throat, measurement of body temperature, assessment of the clinical global impression of the therapy, adherence to treatment, frequency of the adverse reactions before treatment, 3 days after the beginning of therapy and after the course completion (day 10).\nRESULTS: Recovery occurred in 96.6% of patients in group 1 according to examination on the 10th day of treatment and in 93.3% of patients in group 2. The rate of fever regression was higher in group 1 - on the 3rd day of treatment, normalization of temperature was observed in 36.6% and 30% of patients in the comparison group. Pain syndrome, symptoms of throat swelling and difficulty swallowing significantly (p&lt;0.01) regressed by the 10th day in patients of both treatment groups. The incidence of adverse reactions on the 10th day of treatment in group 1 was 10%, in group 2 - 33.3% (p=0.03).\nCONCLUSION: Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS has high therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, comparable to the Amoxiclav in film-coated tablets. At the same time, dispersible tablets of Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid EXPRESS demonstrated a significantly higher safety profile compared to the simple tablet form."

Despite this, there is variability in the management of asymptomatic carriage of S. pyogenes and those at risk of secondary cases of invasive S. pyogenes infection.\nOBJECTIVE: Our systematic review assessed the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens used for eradication of S. pyogenes from the pharynx in asymptomatic individuals.\nMETHODS: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE (1974-), OVID Medline (1948-) and the Cochrane CENTRAL registry. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with asymptomatic participants with >50% with pharyngeal cultures positive with S. pyogenes at baseline. Only studies with microbiological methods including culture (+/- polymerase chain reaction, PCR) were included. We included studies published in English. Each included study was assessed by two independent reviewers for data extraction and risk of bias.\nRESULTS: Of 1166 unique records identified, three RCTs were included in the review. Two of the three included RCTs found oral clindamycin for 10-days was the most efficacious regimen, compared to intramuscular benzathine penicillin G followed by 4 days of oral rifampicin, or monotherapy using benzathine penicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin. Two RCTs were assessed as being at high risk of bias, with the third study demonstrating low/some risk of bias.\nCONCLUSIONS: Current available evidence for the optimal antibiotic in eradicating pharyngeal S. pyogenes carriage is limited. Future RCTs should include penicillin, first-generation cephalosporins, rifampicin, macrolides (such as azithromycin) and clindamycin."

            "abstract": "The exact aetiology of pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) remains unknown. While phototherapy is the most investigated therapeutic modality, azithromycin has been used scarcely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of PLC compared to NB-UVB and evaluating the presence of streptococcal infection as a possible etiological factor in PLC patients. The study was designed as a randomised controlled trial. Twenty-four patients with PLC were randomly allocated into either azithromycin (n\u2009=\u200913, standard dose every 10\u00a0days) or NB-UVB (n\u2009=\u200911, thrice weekly) groups. End of study (EOS) was either complete clearance of lesions or a maximum of 8\u00a0weeks. Therapeutic efficacy was defined as percent reduction in lesions and was calculated for the rash as a whole, erythematous papules alone, and hypopigmented lesions alone and graded into complete, very-good, good, poor or no response. Anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT), anti-deoxyribonuclease B titre (anti-DNaseB) and throat culture were evaluated at day 0. No significant difference existed between both groups as regards therapeutic efficacy. At EOS, NB-UVB achieved significantly more percent reduction in the extent of hypopigmented lesions and consequently in the rash as a whole (p\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.034, respectively). The extent of the rash as a whole was significantly less in the NB-UVB at EOS (p\u2009=\u20090.029, respectively). The effect of NB-UVB on hypopigmented lesions appeared early at week 4 of treatment. Only two patients, one from each group, relapsed during the 3\u00a0month follow-up. Evidence of recent streptococcal infection was present in 79% of the cases, mainly in the form of elevated ASOT (94.7%). It was significantly more encountered in young children (<\u200913\u00a0years) (p\u2009=\u20090.03) and was associated with more extent of erythematous papules and consequently with more extent of the rash as a whole (p\u2009=\u20090.05 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). It did not affect outcome of therapy at EOS. Azithromycin did not show more favorable response in patients with recent streptococcal infection. Therapeutic efficacy of azithromycin is comparable to NB-UVB in treatment of PLC; however, NB-UVB is superior in management of hypopigmented lesions. It is highly suggested that PLC could be a post streptococcal immune mediated disorder.Registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03831269."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges for patients with laboratory-confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis both before and concomitant with antibiotics.\nMETHODS: This post hoc analysis comprised adult participants from 2 earlier randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges in acute pharyngitis. Throat swabs were obtained to diagnose streptococcal infection. Prior to and 2 hours after each dose of study medication (flurbiprofen or placebo lozenges), patients rated 3 symptoms of acute pharyngitis (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing, and swollen throat) using visual analogue scales. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was initiated when culture results were reported. Mean changes in each pharyngeal symptom were compared over the immediate 24 hours before and during the initial 24 hours of antibiotic treatment.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients provided both preantibiotic and concomitant antibiotic efficacy outcomes. Relief of throat pain was 93% greater in the flurbiprofen group than in the placebo group before antibiotic coadministration and 84% greater than placebo during antibiotic administration (both P < .05). Relief of difficulty swallowing was 71% greater in the flurbiprofen group than in the placebo before antibiotic administration (P = .16) and 107% greater during concomitant antibiotic administration (P = .04). Relief of the sensation of throat swelling was 295% greater with flurbiprofen than placebo before antibiotic administration (P = .008) and 70% greater during concomitant antibiotic administration (P = .06). For placebo-treated patients, relief from throat pain and difficulty swallowing were similar before and during antibiotic treatment (P > .05), indicating no benefit with antibiotic administration for these symptoms. No treatment-related discontinuations or serious adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of antibiotic use, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges provide well-tolerated, effective relief of pharyngeal symptoms in patients with streptococcal infection. In the 24 hours after administration, antibiotics provide no relief of throat pain or difficulty swallowing beyond the topical demulcent effects of placebo lozenges."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess\u00a0the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial\u00a0registers on 3 September 2020.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed\u00a0an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis,\u00a0and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials.\u00a0We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence).\u00a0Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR\u00a00.51, 95% CI\u00a00.27 to 0.97;\u00a05 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\u00a0We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR\u00a01.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials;\u00a01728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an\u00a0OR\u00a0of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different\u00a0(OR\u00a01.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence).\u00a0 Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one\u00a0unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if\u00a0resolution of symptoms is better with\u00a0azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR\u00a00.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis\u00a0for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73;\u00a01 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups\u00a0(OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better\u00a0symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.\u00a0 AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are\u00a0clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than\u00a0penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high."

            "title": "[How to reduce the antibacterial load in the treatment of acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis? Possible tactics and practical approaches].",
            "abstract": "Acute tonsillopharyngitis is one of the most frequent reasons for visiting a doctor and prescribing inappropriate antibiotic therapy (ABT). There are several reasons for this - from the difficulties of etiological diagnosis and the development of relapses and possible severe complications to the personal attitude of doctors and patients to the choice of treatment. At the same time, the issue of antibiotic resistance and other aspects associated with the prescription of ABT is one of the most important problems of modern healthcare worldwide. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the best practical approaches to the choice of treatment tactics for acute tonsillitis (AT) in the treatment of children and adults, with an emphasis on reducing the load of ABT. The review examines the indications and disadvantages of clinical and laboratory diagnosis of AT. There are no highly sensitive clinical and laboratory instruments that differentiate viral and bacterial AT. Exudativeis AT in children is not an underlying symptom of streptococcal etiology. Despite the limitations, the modified Centor/McIsaac score \u22653 (taking into account age and the presence of respiratory symptoms) should be used as an indication for ABT in conjunction with a rapid streptotest and subsequent bacteriological culture for S. pyogenes if the screening test is negative. Additional examinations (determination of leukocytosis, CRP and procalcitonin test) are not required for most patients. ABT should not be given to low-risk patients for the treatment and prevention of rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. Prevention of purulent complications (paratonsillitis and retropharyngeal abscess, acute otitis media, cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, or acute sinusitis) is not a specific indication for ABT in AT and is not required in most patients. The strategy of \u00abdelayed antibiotic prescriptions\u00bb with monitoring the patient's condition for 2-3 days is appropriate and highly effective in doubtful cases. The drugs of choice for treatment of AT are amoxicillin and oral forms of I and II generation cephalosporins. Macrolides are not indicated as first-line treatment for AT. The course of ABT for streptococcal AT is 10 days, which reduces the risk of recurrent episode. Topical drugs can be the only means of etiopathogenetic treatment with viral AT, or additional for bacterial AT. Their use not only relieves sore throat, but also shortens the duration of the disease, and also improves the patients prognosis. Benzalkonium chloride + tyrothricin + benzocaine (Dorithyrcin) may be a rational drug of choice for topical therapy due to the available clinical evidence. There is a significant reserve for reducing the load of ABT during AT. Further clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of short courses of ABT in the treatment of AT in high-income countries and provide a basis for strong recommendations for topical drug use. This can reduce the frequency of ABT prescribing and increase the level of interaction between specialists and patients."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP) is a very common disease in children. In non-streptococcal ATP, systemic antibiotics are usually not indicated, but topical antimicrobial therapy is advisable.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of cetylpyridinium chloride with gramicidin C in the form of a spray in children with ATP in a prospective multicenter non-interventional study.\nUNLABELLED: Patients and methods. The study included 94 patients aged 6-15 years with non-streptococcal ATP. A standard examination, assessment of the pain intensity in the throat using a visual analogue scale, assessment of the pain frequency during swallowing and a score assessment of objective manifestations were carried out. Sixty-eight patients of the main group received a combination of cetylpyridinium chloride with gramicidin C (Grammidin for children) in the form of a spray, 26 patients of the control group received throat irrigation with saline solution (based on sea water) for 7 days. Therapy was assessed after 1 day (by phone), 4 and 8 days (by examination).\nRESULTS: The groups of patients did not differ significantly in terms of demographic indicators and initial clinical manifestations. Body temperature initially did not differ, but was significantly lower in the main group after 1 (p=0.003) and 4 (p=0.04) days. The sore throat pain intensity decrease in the main group significantly exceeded this indicator in the control group after 1 (p&lt;0.001) and 4 (p &lt;0.001) days. Initially, swallowing pain was observed in all patients, after 4 days the complaint was significantly less frequent in the main group (p&lt;0.001). The total assessment of objective data was significantly lower in the main group after 4 (p&lt;0.001) and 8 (p&lt;0.001) days. No adverse effects of pharmacotherapy were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study showed high efficacy and safety of the cetylpyridinium chloride and gramicidin C (in the form of a spray) combination for non-streptococcal ATP in children aged 6-15 years."

The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and annualized hospitalization rates for pneumococcal bacteremia in Thailand were highest in children aged <5years and the elderly. The most prevalent serotype is serotype 6B, which is included in both the 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV10 [also known as PHiD-CV] and PCV13, respectively) registered in Thailand. Other common serotypes are 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F (included in both PCVs) and 6A and 19A (only included in PCV13). PCV10/PHiD-CV and PCV13 should cover 48.8%-74% and 73.2%-92% of isolates among children aged \u22645 years, respectively, and 40.0%-47.9% and 58.3%-60.9% of isolates among adults aged \u226565 years. Only PCV13 is licensed for adults in Thailand. Pneumococcal isolates were most commonly resistant to erythromycin, cefuroxime, and penicillin. Despite their demonstrated cost effectiveness and efficacy in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage and IPD, PCVs are not included in the Thai national immunization program. The serotype-specific IPD incidence in Thailand suggests that PCVs will reduce the disease burden in all age groups, but particularly in children and older adults."

            "title": "Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat.",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test).\u00a0We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests\u00a0were\u00a0used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests\u00a0alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests\u00a0in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests\u00a0were\u00a0used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I2 = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests\u00a0may\u00a0not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I2 = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to\u00a026.65; P = 0.93;\u00a0I2 = 62%; very low-certainty evidence,\u00a0which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the\u00a0evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I2 = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up,\u00a0but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity.\u00a0 AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children)."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects approximately two per cent of the general population. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form: it usually appears as raised, red patches of inflamed skin, covered with silvery white scales. The patches often occur in a symmetrical pattern. Guttate psoriasis is a particular form of psoriasis with widespread, small erythematosquamous lesions. Streptococcal infection is suspected to be a triggering factor for the onset of guttate psoriasis, and flare-up of chronic plaque psoriasis. The previous Cochrane Review on this topic was published in 2000; it required an update because antistreptococcal treatment continues to be used to treat psoriasis, especially for the acute form of guttate psoriasis.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Studies Online, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and five trials registers (January 2019). We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies and searched conference proceedings from the American Academy of Dermatology, Society for Investigative Dermatology, and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing antistreptococcal interventions (tonsillectomy or systemic antibiotic treatment) in people with clinically diagnosed acute guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis compared with placebo, no intervention, or each other.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were: 1) time-to-resolution; achieving clear or almost clear skin (Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0 or 1 or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 or 100); 2) proportion of participants with adverse effects and severe adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin; 2) proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2; 3) risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up. Short-term assessment was defined as within eight weeks of the start of treatment; long-term was at least one year after the start of treatment.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included five trials (162 randomised participants); three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department. One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 (i.e. mild) to 23 (i.e. severe) in four studies. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. We did not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and interventions.None of the trials measured our efficacy primary outcome, time-to-resolution, or the secondary outcome, risk of having at least one relapse at long-term follow-up.We rated the quality of the results as very low-quality evidence, due to high risk of bias (absence of blinding of participants and caregivers, and high risk of outcome reporting bias) and imprecision (single study data with a low number of events). Hence, we are very uncertain about the results presented.Guttate psoriasisOne three-armed trial (N = 43) assessed penicillin (50,000 international units (IU)/kg/day in three doses) versus erythromycin (250 mg four times per day) versus no treatment (treatment for 14 days, with six-week follow-up from start of treatment). Adverse events and the proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin were not measured.One trial (N = 20) assessed penicillin (1.6 MU (million units) intramuscularly once a day) versus no treatment (six weeks of treatment, with eight-week follow-up from start of treatment). At six-week (short-term) follow-up, no adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants with clear or almost clear skin (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 5.85).One trial (N = 20) assessed rifampicin (300 mg twice daily) versus placebo (14-day treatment duration; six-week follow-up from start of treatment); none of the review outcomes were measured.These trials did not measure the proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2.Chronic plaque psoriasisOne trial (N = 50) assessed long-term azithromycin treatment (500 mg daily dose) versus vitamin C. Adverse events were reported in the azithromycin group (10 out of 30 had nausea and mild abdominal upset), but not in the vitamin C group. The proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin was not measured. In the azithromycin group, 18/30 versus 0/20 participants in the vitamin C group reached PASI 75 at the end of 48 weeks of treatment (RR 25.06, 95% CI 1.60 to 393.59).One trial (N = 29) assessed tonsillectomy versus no treatment, with 24-month follow-up after surgery. One participant in the tonsillectomy group had minor bleeding. At eight-week follow-up, 1/15 in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 90; and 3/15 participants in the tonsillectomy group, and 0/14 in the no treatment group achieved PASI 75 (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 116.7).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only five trials (N = 162), which assessed the effects of five comparisons (systemic antibiotic treatment (penicillin, azithromycin) or tonsillectomy). Two comparisons (erythromycin compared to no treatment, and rifampicin compared to placebo) did not measure any of the outcomes of interest. There was very low-quality evidence for the outcomes that were measured, Therefore, we are uncertain of both the efficacy and safety of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.The included trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and involved only a small number of unrepresentative participants, with limited measurement of our outcomes of interest. The studies did not allow investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed.Further trials assessing the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin are needed in children and young adults with guttate psoriasis."

            "abstract": "PURPOSE: Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) causes a recurrent acute pharyngotonsillitis (RAPT) in children. Moreover, the repeated use of antibiotics contributes to its resistance. However, S. Salivarius 24SMB and S. oralis 89a were effective probiotics in other infections. Thus, we decided to evaluate this combination efficacy compared to placebo in RAPT.\nMETHODS: Patients with microbiologically confirmed GABHS were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial. They received the aforementioned combination or placebo as an oral spray. We investigated episodes of frequency and duration, need for antibiotics, school days lost, the treatment impact on life quality, treatment compliance and side effects during a 90-day treatment and a 6-month follow-up.\nRESULTS: We included 41 patients in each group. The mean number of GABHS infection was significantly lower during both study periods for the two groups. However, our treatment group showed a lower rate. Moreover, the probiotic group had a lower mean number and a shorter median duration of GABHS episodes during both study periods than controls. Furthermore, the mean duration of antibiotic treatment was lower in the probiotic group during the 90-day and 6-month follow-up periods. Similarly, patients in the probiotic group showed a significantly lower mean number of absence days from school but higher EQ-VAS score. Indeed, all patients included were compliant to treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified potential probiotics, possessing desirable features against GABHS pharyngotonsillitis. Our findings represent the first evidence which throws the light on using these probiotics that can reduce antibiotics use which did not have efficient results regarding recurrence."

            "title": "[Evaluation of Mascia Brunelli rapid antigen test in the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis].",
            "abstract": "Pharyngitis in most cases is due to viral microorganisms however drug therapy without the detection of etiological agent leads to unnecessary use of antibiotics. On the other hand, when the etiologic agent is group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) it is important to identify the etiologic agent rapidly which will guide the treatment with appropriate antibiotics. The use of highly sensitive rapid tests will contribute significantly to early diagnosis and appropriate therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Mascia Brunelli rapid antigen test for the detection of GAS in throat swab samples. A total of 833 throat swab samples submitted to our laboratory with pre-diagnosis of pharyngitis were assessed between June 2016 and August 2016. The samples were simultaneously cultured and tested by rapid Mascia Brunelli Strep-A Card (Mascia Brunelli S.p.a, Italy). For identification, bacitracin sensitivity, PYR test and latex agglutination test in addition to Bruker MALDI-TOF MS (Daltonics, Germany) system were used. The density of GAS growth in the culture was noted. The samples that were false negative with Mascia Brunelli test were re-tested with QuickVue + Strep A Test (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, USA) rapid antigen test. A total of 833 patients, 376 (45.2%) female and 457 (54.8%) male were included in the study. The age range was between 0-94 years with a mean value of 7.86 \u00b1 6.72. 125 (15%) and 94 (11.28%) of the samples were positive with culture and rapid antigen test, respectively. Mascia Brunelli antigen test gave negative results for 31 culture positive samples. Of these 31 samples, 28 were found positive by QuickVue + Strep A antigen test. As a result, the sensitivity of the test was found to be independent of the inoculum effect. The culture positivity rate in patients between 5-15 years was 18.4%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and the accuracy of Mascia Brunelli antigen test, with respect to culture, were 75.2%, 100%, 100%, 95.81% and 96.28%, respectively. In conclusion, the selection of rapid antigen tests with high sensitivity in the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis will contribute to the prevention of resistance development by appropriate use of antibiotics as well as early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. However, confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results by culture is very important in terms of false diagnosis and prevention of incomplete treatment."

The aim is to optimize drug use and dosing regimens to improve the clinical efficacy. The present study was selected following a structured prioritizing process by independent experts.\nMETHODS: This phase IV study is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study with non-inferiority design regarding the therapeutic use of penicillin V with two parallel groups. The overall aim is to study if the total exposure with penicillin V can be reduced from 1000\u00a0mg three times daily for 10\u00a0days to 800\u00a0mg four times daily for 5\u00a0days when treating Streptococcus pyogenes (Lancefield group A) pharyngotonsillitis. Patients will be recruited from 17 primary health care centers in Sweden. Adult men and women, youth and children \u22656\u00a0years of age who consult for sore throat and is judged to have a pharyngotonsillitis, with 3-4 Centor criteria and a positive rapid test for group A streptococci, will be included in the study. The primary outcome is clinical cure 5-7 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. Follow-up controls will be done by telephone after 1 and 3 months. Throat symptoms, potential relapses and complications will be monitored, as well as adverse events. Patients (n\u2009=\u2009432) will be included during 2\u00a0years.\nDISCUSSION: In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the shortage of new antimicrobial agents it is necessary to revisit optimal usage of old antibiotics. Old antimicrobial drugs are often associated with inadequate knowledge on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and lack of optimized dosing regimens based on randomized controlled clinical trials. If a shorter and more potent treatment regimen is shown to be equivalent with the normal 10\u00a0day regimen this can imply great advantages for both patients (adherence, adverse events, resistance) and the community (resistance, drug costs).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number 2015-001752-30 .

            "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniaeis one of the key pathogens responsible for otitis media (OM), the most common infection in children and the largest cause of childhood antibiotic prescription. Novel therapeutic strategies that reduce the overall antibiotic consumption due to OM are required because, although widespread pneumococcal conjugate immunization has controlled invasive pneumococcal disease, overall OM incidence has not decreased. Biofilm formation represents an important phenotype contributing to the antibiotic tolerance and persistence ofS. pneumoniaein chronic or recurrent OM. We investigated the treatment of pneumococcal biofilms with nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous signaling molecule and therapeutic agent that has been demonstrated to trigger biofilm dispersal in other bacterial species. We hypothesized that addition of low concentrations of NO to pneumococcal biofilms would improve antibiotic efficacy and that higher concentrations exert direct antibacterial effects. Unlike in many other bacterial species, low concentrations of NO did not result inS. pneumoniaebiofilm dispersal. Instead, treatment of bothin vitrobiofilms andex vivoadenoid tissue samples (a reservoir forS. pneumoniaebiofilms) with low concentrations of NO enhanced pneumococcal killing when combined with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, an antibiotic commonly used to treat chronic OM. Quantitative proteomic analysis using iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) identified 13 proteins that were differentially expressed following low-concentration NO treatment, 85% of which function in metabolism or translation. Treatment with low-concentration NO, therefore, appears to modulate pneumococcal metabolism and may represent a novel therapeutic approach to reduce antibiotic tolerance in pneumococcal biofilms."

Carriage was significantly less frequent among the children who had received recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio [OR 0.41]; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.22-0.76). Multivariate analyses showed no association between carriage and vaccination status, with ORs of 1.05 (95% CI 0.70-1.58) for carriers of any pneumococcal serotype, 1.08 (95% CI 0.72-1.62) for carriers of any of the serotypes included in 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and 0.76 (95% CI 0.45-1.28) for carriers of any of the six additional serotypes of PCV13. Serotypes 19 F, 4 and 9 V were the most frequently identified serotypes in vaccinated subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results showed that carriage of S. pneumoniae is relatively common in all school-aged children and adolescents with asthma, regardless of the severity of disease and the administration of PCV7 in the first years of life. This highlights the problem of the duration of the protection against colonisation provided by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and the importance of re-colonization by the same pneumococcal serotypes included in the previously used vaccine."

An oropharyngeal swab was obtained from 299 patients aged 6-17 y with DM1 who were enrolled during routine clinical visits. DNA from swabs was analyzed for S. pneumoniae using real-time polymerase chain reaction. S. pneumoniae was identified in the swabs of 148 subjects (49.8%). Colonization was strictly age-related and declined significantly in the group aged \u226515 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.57). Carriage was also significantly influenced by sex (lower in females: OR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91), ethnicity (less common among non-Caucasians: OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.89), parental smoking habit (more frequent among children with at least one smoker between parents: OR 1.76; 95% CI, 0.90-2.07), and the administration of antibiotic therapy in the previous 3 months (less frequent among patients who received antibiotics: OR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62). Multivariate analyses of the entire study population showed no association between carriage and PCV7 vaccination status. Serotypes 19F, 9V, and 4 were the most frequently identified serotypes. In conclusion, school-age children and adolescents with DM1 are frequently colonized by S. pneumoniae, and protection against pneumococcal carriage following infant and toddler vaccination was not effective after several years. Together with the need to increase vaccine uptake in all the children aged <2 years, these results suggest that PCV booster doses are needed in DM1 patients to maintain the protection offered by these vaccinations."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Uganda, the main causes of death in children under 5 years of age are malaria and pneumonia--often due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. In preparation for a community case management intervention for pneumonia and malaria, the bacterial composition of the nasopharyngeal flora and its in vitro resistance were determined in children aged five or under to establish baseline resistance to commonly used antibiotics.\nMETHODS: In a population-based survey in April 2008, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 152 randomly selected healthy children under 5 years of age in the Iganga/Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS). Medical history and prior treatment were recorded. Demographic characteristics and risk factors for carriage of resistant strains were obtained from the HDSS census. Bacteria were isolated and analysed for antibiotic susceptibility using disk diffusion and E test.\nRESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) carriage was 58.6%, and, while most (80.9%) isolates had intermediate resistance to penicillin, none was highly resistant. Whereas no isolate was resistant to erythromycin, 98.9% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).\nCONCLUSIONS: In vitro resistance in S. pneumoniae to co-trimoxazole treatment was high, and the majority of isolates had intermediate resistance to penicillin. To inform treatment policies on the clinical efficacy of current treatment protocols for pneumonia in health facilities and at the community level, routine surveillance of resistance in pneumonia pathogens is needed as well as research on treatment efficacy in cases with resistant strains. Improved clinical algorithms and diagnostics for pneumonia should be developed."

Eight nasopharyngeal specimens were collected by swabbing between ages 2 and 24 months. S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method and the Etest. Nasopharyngeal acquisition and prevalence of ANSP during ages 7-24 months were compared between the 2 vaccine groups.\nRESULTS: In general, new acquisition of pneumococci nonsusceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, penicillin plus erythromycin, and multiple drugs (\u22653 antibiotics) was significantly lower in the PCV13 group compared with the PCV7 group; the main serotypes contributing to this significant decrease were serotype 19F, present in PCV13 and PCV7, and serotypes 6A and 19A, present in PCV13 only.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCV13 has a significant added benefit over PCV7 in reducing carriage of ANSP.

Most patients with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibiotics, therefore, therapies that relieve symptoms should be recommended to patients. We report two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge in patients with and without streptococcal sore throat.\nMETHODS: The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of pharyngitis. The practitioner assessed the likelihood of Strep A infection based on historical and clinical findings. Patients were randomised to flurbiprofen 8.75 mg or placebo lozenges under double-blind conditions and reported the three throat symptoms at baseline and at regular intervals over 24 h.\nRESULTS: A total of 402 patients received study medication (n = 203 flurbiprofen, n = 199 placebo). Throat culture identified Strep A in 10.0% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in a further 14.0%. The practitioners' assessments correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11/40 cases (sensitivity 27.5%, and specificity 79.7%). A single flurbiprofen lozenge provided significantly greater relief than placebo for all three throat symptoms, lasting 3-4 h for patients with and without Strep A/C. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen lozenges over 24 h also led to symptom relief, although not statistically significant in the Strep A/C group. There were no serious adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the challenge of identifying Strep A based on clinical features. With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered. As demonstrated here, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges are an effective therapeutic option, providing immediate and long-lasting symptom relief in patients with and without Strep A/C infection."

This study aimed at determining the nasopharyngeal carrier rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae in healthy Palestinian children under age two prior to the full introduction of the pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which was originally introduced into Palestine in a pilot trial in September, 2010. In a cross sectional study, nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 397 healthy children from different Palestinian districts between the beginning of November 2012 to the end of January 2013. Samples were inoculated into blood agar and suspected colonies were examined by amplifying the pneumococcal-specific autolysin gene using a real-time PCR. Serotypes were identified by a PCR that incorporated different sets of specific primers. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured by disk diffusion and MIC methods. The resulting carrier rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 55.7% (221/397). The main serotypes were PCV7 serotypes 19F (12.2%), 23F (9.0%), 6B (8.6%) and 14 (4%) and PCV13 serotypes 6A (13.6%) and 19A (4.1%). Notably, serotype 6A, not included in the pilot trial (PCV7) vaccine, was the most prevalent. Resistance to more than two drugs was observed for bacteria from 34.1% of the children (72/211) while 22.3% (47/211) carried bacteria were susceptible to all tested antibiotics. All the isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. Any or all of these might impinge on the type and efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and antibiotics to be used for prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease in the country."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is currently the only commonly occurring form of acute pharyngitis for which antibiotic therapy is definitely indicated. Polish guidelines advocate the use of modified Centor score (MCS) to assess the probability of GAS pharyngitis. They advise performing throat culture or rapid antigen detection test (RADT) in children with score 2-3 in MCS and treating with antibiotic only those in whom GAS was detected. Negative RADT results should be confirmed by culture. In children with score 4, the guidelines allow to introduce empiric antibiotic therapy. Phenoxymethyl penicillin is recommended as a drug of choice to treat GAS pharyngitis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of strategy recommended by Polish guidelines in identifying those children with acute pharyngitis who require antibiotic treatment. Hence, diagnostic values of score 4 in MCS and RADT were assessed using throat culture as a reference standard. Phenoxymethyl penicillin efficacy in GAS eradication and prevention of post-streptococcal complications were estimated as well.\nMETHODS: Ninety children between 2 and 15 years of age with acute pharyngitis symptoms suggesting GAS etiology (MCS \u2265 2), participated in our study. At the initial visit MCS was evaluated and two throat swabs were collected to perform RADT and culture. In children with GAS pharyngitis treated with penicillin, microbiological cure was assessed by performing two control throat cultures. Next, children were under observation for 3 months.\nRESULTS: Positive predictive value of score 4 in MCS turned out to be 48.05% (95% CI: 36.5-59.7%). RADT sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy proved to be 100%, 96%, and 98%, respectively. GAS eradication rate in children treated with penicillin turned out to be 92.5%. No post-streptococcal sequelae occurred in any child in 3-month observation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Empiric antibiotic therapy in children with score 4 in MCS will result in significant overtreatment of those with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis. New generation RADT diagnostic value in GAS detection proved to be equivalent to that of culture, which obviates the need of backup culture in children with negative RADT results. Phenoxymethyl penicillin revealed high eradication efficacy and proved to prevent post-streptococcal sequelae in children with acute GAS pharyngitis."

It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1966 to October week 2, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to October 2012) and Web of Science (2010 to October 2012).\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, complications, adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data.\nMAIN RESULTS: Seventeen trials (5352 participants) were included; 16 compared with penicillin (six with cephalosporins, six with macrolides, three with carbacephem and one with sulfonamides), one trial compared clindamycin and ampicillin. Randomisation reporting, allocation concealment and blinding were poor.There was no difference in symptom resolution between cephalosporins and penicillin (intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; N = 5; n = 2018; odds ratio for absence of resolution of symptoms (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12). Clinical relapse was lower with cephalosporins (N = 4; n = 1386; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99; overall number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50), but found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin. Carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment (N = 3; n = 795; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14), but only in children (N = 2; n = 233; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8.3). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides (N = 1, n = 489; OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is insufficient to show clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be recommended as first choice."

Strains growing in blood culture were considered as invasive, strains growing in throat and abscess cultures were considered as non-invasive. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and 16S rRNA sequence analysis at species level. emm genotyping of strains identified as S.pyogenes, was performed by PCR method as proposed by the CDC. Amplicons were obtained and sequenced in 23 out of 35 isolates. The results were compared with CDC emm sequence database. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was performed by agar dilution method and evaluated as recommended by CLSI. Twenty-three out of 35 isolates could be typed and 15 different emm genotypes were detected. The most common emm types were emm1 (22%), emm89 (13%), emm18 (9%) and emm19 (9%). The detection rate of other emm types (emm5, 12, 14, 17, 26, 29, 37, 74, 78, 92, 99) was 47%. Types emm1, 12, 19, 74, 89 and 99 were observed in strains isolated from blood cultures. It was detected that nine of the 15 (60%) emm types are within the contents of 26 valent vaccine (emm 1, 5, 12, 14, 18, 19, 29, 89, 92). It was also observed that 17 (74%) of the 23 cases were infected by vaccine types and the four emm types (emm1, 12, 19, 89) identified in blood samples were among the vaccine types. All of the strains were found susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, lincomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin and linezolid, however six isolates were resistant to levofloxacin (MIC= 4 and 16 \u00b5g/ml) and one isolate was resistant to tetracycline (MIC= 16 \u00b5g/ml). In conclusion, this preliminary local study with limited number of invasive and non-invasive S.pyogenes isolates, emphasized the need for larger scale multi-center studies to determine the analogy and efficacy of the vaccine in development."

We retrieved included studies in full, and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long-term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10-day course of oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. . In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution."

            "abstract": "The human nasopharynx is the main reservoir for Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) and the source for both horizontal spread and transition to infection. Some clinical evidence indicates that nasopharyngeal carriage is harder to eradicate with antibiotics than is pneumococcal invasive disease, which may suggest that colonizing pneumococci exist in biofilm communities that are more resistant to antibiotics. While pneumococcal biofilms have been observed during symptomatic infection, their role in colonization and the role of host factors in this process have been less studied. Here, we show for the first time that pneumococci form highly structured biofilm communities during colonization of the murine nasopharynx that display increased antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, pneumococcal biofilms grown on respiratory epithelial cells exhibited phenotypes similar to those observed during colonization in vivo, whereas abiotic surfaces produced less ordered and more antibiotic-sensitive biofilms. The importance of bacterial-epithelial cell interactions during biofilm formation was shown using both clinical strains with variable colonization efficacies and pneumococcal mutants with impaired colonization characteristics in vivo. In both cases, the ability of strains to form biofilms on epithelial cells directly correlated with their ability to colonize the nasopharynx in vivo, with colonization-deficient strains forming less structured and more antibiotic-sensitive biofilms on epithelial cells, an association that was lost when grown on abiotic surfaces. Thus, these studies emphasize the importance of host-bacterial interactions in pneumococcal biofilm formation and provide the first experimental data to explain the high resistance of pneumococcal colonization to eradication by antibiotics."

In addition to undergoing the study intervention, each patient had a standard throat swab sent to the laboratory for formal culture. A questionnaire detailing the clinical features was to be completed in each case.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ten near-patient tests were performed. Complete laboratory results were available in 177 cases (77%). Clinical data were available for analysis in 94 patients (53%). In our patient population, the near-patient test had a high specificity (98.6%) but a low sensitivity (71%). The clinical presentation of confirmed group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is very variable.\nCONCLUSIONS: The QuickVue In-Line Strep A test for streptococcal pharyngitis is unreliable in our patient population. Clinical findings are unhelpful in confirming the diagnosis. Formal laboratory culture is the criterion standard for identifying the organism, but the results are not clinically significant in every case. Acute pharyngitis presenting to the pediatric emergency department can be managed in accordance with the recommendations in the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network guideline."

            "abstract": "Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from mild throat and skin infections to severe invasive diseases such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Dextromethorphan (DM), a dextrorotatory morphinan and a widely used antitussive drug, has recently been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated the potential protective effect of DM in GAS infection using an air pouch infection mouse model. Our results showed that DM treatment increased the survival rate of GAS-infected mice. Bacterial numbers in the air pouch were lower in mice treated with DM than in those infected with GAS alone. The bacterial elimination efficacy was associated with increased cell viability and bactericidal activity of air-pouch-infiltrating cells. Moreover, DM treatment prevented bacterial dissemination in the blood and reduced serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-1\u03b2 and the chemokines monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), and RANTES. In addition, GAS-induced mouse liver injury was reduced by DM treatment. Taken together, DM can increase bacterial killing and reduce inflammatory responses to prevent sepsis in GAS infection. The consideration of DM as an adjunct treatment in combination with antibiotics against bacterial infection warrants further study."

Randomisation reporting, allocation concealment and blinding were poor.There was no difference in symptom resolution between cephalosporins and penicillin (intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; N = 5; n = 2018; odds ratio for absence of resolution of symptoms (OR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12). Clinical relapse was lower with cephalosporins (N = 4; n = 1386; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99); overall number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50), but found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin. Carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment (N = 3; n = 795; OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14), but only in children (N = 2; n = 233; OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8.3). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides (N = 1, n = 489; OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is insufficient for clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be recommended as first choice."

            "title": "Do pneumococcal conjugate vaccines provide any cross-protection against serotype 19A?",
            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vCRM) in several countries has led to a rapid, significant drop in vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in immunized children. In the United States and some other countries with high antibiotic use, a subsequent rise in serotype 19A IPD has been taken to indicate that the 19F conjugate in the vaccine provides no cross-protection against the immunologically related 19A.\nDISCUSSION: We systematically assessed the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of 19F-containing vaccines against 19A disease or nasopharyngeal carriage by searching English-language articles in the electronic databases PubMed, Current contents, Scopus, and Embase from 1985 to 2008. The vaccine efficacy and effectiveness point estimates were consistently positive for modest protection against 19A IPD and acute otitis media (AOM). However, statistical significance was not reached in any individual study. No consistent impact of 7vCRM on 19A nasopharyngeal colonization could be detected. These findings are discussed in context of immunogenicity analyses indicating that 7vCRM induces functionally active anti-19A antibodies after the booster dose, and that other 19F-containing vaccine formulations may elicit higher levels of such antibodies after both primary and booster doses.\nSUMMARY: Taken together, these results suggest that 19F-conjugates can provide some protection against 19A disease. The magnitude of this protection in a given setting will likely depend on several factors. These include the anti-19A immunogenicity of the specific vaccine formulation, the number of doses of that formulation needed to elicit the response, and the burden of 19A disease that occurs after those doses. It is possible that a modest protective effect may be obscured by the presence of countervailing selection pressures (such as high antibiotic use) that favor an increase in colonization with antibiotic-non-susceptible strains of 19A."

The current approach to the prevention of a primary attack of rheumatic fever in children using oral medication for streptococcal pharyngitis is poorly supported. The efficacy of injectable penicillin, in high rheumatic fever incidence military environments is indisputable.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate school-based control of rheumatic fever in an endemic area.\nMETHODS: Fifty-three schools ( approximately 22,000 students) from a rheumatic fever high incidence setting ( approximately 60/100,000) in Auckland, New Zealand were randomized. The control group received routine general practice care. The intervention was a school-based sore throat clinic program with free nurse-observed oral penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

            "abstract": "Primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever is accomplished by proper identification and adequate antibiotic treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is best accomplished by combining clinical judgment with diagnostic test results, the criterion standard of which is the throat culture. Penicillin (either oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice, because it is cost-effective, has a narrow spectrum of activity, and has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to penicillin have not been documented. For penicillin-allergic individuals, acceptable alternatives include a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin, oral clindamycin, or various oral macrolides or azalides. The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention). The recommended duration of prophylaxis depends on the number of previous attacks, the time elapsed since the last attack, the risk of exposure to GAS infections, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or a macrolide or azalide are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic individuals.

The first group included 55 cochlear implant recipients and all of them were vaccinated with VPn7. The second group included 60 non-vaccinated healthy children. Nasopharyngeal swabs for culture were obtained from each child in order to detect the pneumococcus, its serotypes and the sensitivity to antibiotics.\nRESULTS: In the control group of non-vaccinated children, 25% of them were found to be pharyngeal pneumococcus carriers, whereas this figure fell to 11% in the vaccinated group. The non-vaccine serotypes (83.3%) isolated in vaccinated children showed high or moderate sensitivity to penicillin. There were no complications due to S pneumoniae infections in any of the patients with cochlear implant who were vaccinated.\nCONCLUSIONS: VPn7 contributes to a decrease in pharyngeal colonization by pneumococci in general and, in particular, by the pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine, although there is a replacement phenomenon involving non-vaccine serotypes."

            "abstract": "MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals (formerly Advancis Pharmaceutical) is developing an improved version of amoxicillin using its pulsatile oral drug delivery technology, called PULSYS. Amoxicillin PULSYS is intended to provide a lower treatment dose, once-daily alternative to currently approved amoxicillin and penicillin regimens for the treatment of adolescents/adults with pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis. If amoxicillin PULSYS is approved, it will be the first and only once-daily amoxicillin therapy approved for use in the US. Regulatory submissions for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis have been made in the US. Amoxicillin PULSYS is in clinical development for the treatment of pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis due to group A streptococcal infections in adolescents/adults as a tablet formulation. MiddleBrook was conducting clinical development of a sprinkle formulation for children. However, this has been put on hold for financial reasons. MiddleBrook is seeking regulatory approval for this product as a 505(b)(2) product, which is one that is not considered to be a completely new product, but is also not a generic product. It is a product with some differences from a previously approved product and clinical data to support such differences are required; however, the basic safety and efficacy studies may have been conducted by other organisations. In June 2007, Advancis Pharmaceutical was renamed as MiddleBrook Pharmaceuticals, Inc. MiddleBrook and Par Pharmaceuticals entered a co-promotion agreement for this product in June 2004. Par was to fund future development in exchange for co-exclusive marketing rights and exclusive rights to sell amoxicillin PULSYS. MiddleBrook retained responsibility for the manufacturing programme and also retained all patents and brand names and was responsible for their enforcement. However, this collaboration was subsequently terminated in August 2005 by Par Pharmaceutical. MiddleBrook received the US $4.75 million R&D reimbursement payment due in the third quarter of 2005 and expects no further payments under the collaboration. Under certain circumstances, the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle Par to receive a share of net profits up to 50% of its total US $23 million investment in the development of certain amoxicillin PULSYS products, should a product covered by the agreement be successfully commercialised. Following the end of the first quarter of 2005, MiddleBrook entered into agreements with Clonmel Healthcare Ltd (STADA Group), which will provide MiddleBrook with commercial supply of its amoxicillin PULSYS products being evaluated in phase III trials. MiddleBrook has closed US $24 million in private placement of common equity; funds will be used to support the regulatory approval process for the once-daily amoxicillin pulsatile product. The company conducted phase III trials of this once-daily pulsatile amoxicillin product for the treatment of pharyngitis/tonsillitis due to group A streptococcal infections (commonly referred to as strep throat). Two trials of a 775 mg tablet formulation were conducted in adolescent/adult populations. In December 2006, the company entered into a definitive private placement agreement, raising US $18 million in gross proceeds. It intends to use the proceeds to prepare for the potential commercial launch of amoxicillin PULSYS and to continue the development of other products. The first of the adolescent/adult phase III trials was initiated in October 2004 in the US. This double-blind, non-inferiority, pivotal trial enrolled 510 such patients who received amoxicillin PULSYS 775 mg administered in tablet form once daily for 7 days or the US FDA standard comparator regimen, penicillin 250 mg administered four times daily for 10 days. However, in June 2005, the company reported that amoxicillin PULSYS failed to achieve the primary endpoint of this trial (i.e. bacterial eradication). The company initiated the second adolescent/adult phase III trial in November 2005. This two-arm, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trial enrolled a total of 620 patients from the US and Canada. Patients received amoxicillin PULSYS (775 mg tablet once daily for 10 days) or the standard penicillin regimen previously mentioned. Top-line results presented in August 2006 showed that the desired microbiological and clinical endpoints were achieved in this trial. In addition, the trial showed that amoxicillin PULSYS achieved 85% bacterial eradication in the per-protocol population, in accordance with the FDA's guidance for approval as a first-line therapy for pharyngitis. MiddleBrook has completed a phase I dose finding trial of its paediatric 'sprinkle' formulation of amoxicillin PULSYS in healthy volunteers. The company commenced a two-arm, investigator-blinded, non-inferiority, US-based, phase III trial in Janary 2005 to evaluate a 'sprinkle' formulation of amoxicillin PULSYS among paediatric patients with acute pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by group A streptococcal infections. The drug was administered in multiparticulate granules, designed to be sprinkled over food, in two dosages: 475 mg once daily in patients aged 6 months to 4 years, and 775 mg once daily for children aged 5-12 years. Patients were given either 7 days' treatment with amoxicillin PULSYS or penicillin VK four times daily for 10 days. The primary endpoint of the paediatric trial was the same as the adult one. However, in July 2005, the company reported that the product failed to achieve its desired microbiological and clinical endpoints (primary and secondary) in this trial. MiddleBrook was to review the full data and evaluate what steps, if any, could be taken to improve future outcomes."

Four clinical features (fever [history of] > or = 38 degrees C, lack of cough, tonsillar exudate, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy) are recorded in 355 patients aged four years to > or =15 years. A rapid antigen diagnostic test (RADT) is performed, as well as a throat culture. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titre is performed in patients 11 years. GABHS from patients are tested for susceptibility to different antibiotics. Throat cultures were positive for GABHS in 19% patients. Rapid tests were positive in 24%. Compared with throat culture, the rapid test gave a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of 73% and a negative predictive value of 98%. For patients with three or four clinical features, however, the sensitivity was considerably higher at 97%. Using the ASO test as a reference, no association was found between RADT and culture results. Zithromax showed the highest prescription rate (25.5%) and produced a high cure rate (91%) in patients with GABHS pharyngitis."

A total of 2,482 patients received study medication (safety population). Of these, 2,324 were clinically evaluable (efficacy population), and 1,156 of them had at least one pathogen isolated at screening (bacteriology population). S pneumoniae was isolated from 371 patients in the bacteriology population, including 37 with PRSP. Follow-up in the bacteriology population on days 17 through 28 revealed that amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was successful in 345 of 371 patients with S pneumoniae infection (93.0%) and in 36 of 37patients with PRSP infection (97.3%), including 7 of 8 patients (87.5%) whose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs were 4/2 microg/ml or higher. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate was generally well tolerated, as only 2.2% of patients withdrew because of adverse events. This agent represents a valuable new therapeutic option for the empiric treatment of ABRS, particularly in areas where antimicrobial-resistant pathogens (including beta-lactamase-positive organisms) are prevalent, and for the treatment of patients who are at increased risk of infection with PRSP."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The widespread use of antibiotics for treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has resulted in the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens that are difficult to treat. However, it has been shown that most children with nonsevere AOM recover without ABX. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, acceptability, and costs of a non-ABX intervention for children with nonsevere AOM.\nMETHODOLOGY: Children 6 months to 12 years old with AOM were screened by using a novel AOM-severity screening index. Parents of children with nonsevere AOM received an educational intervention, and their children were randomized to receive either immediate antibiotics (ABX; amoxicillin plus symptom medication) or watchful waiting (WW; symptom medication only). The investigators, but not the parents, were blinded to enrollment status. Primary outcomes included parent satisfaction with AOM care, resolution of symptoms, AOM failure/recurrence, and nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to ABX. Secondary outcomes included medication-related adverse events, serious adverse events, unanticipated AOM-related office and emergency department visits and telephone calls, the child's absence from day care or school resulting from AOM, the parent's absence from school or work because of their child's AOM, and costs of treatment. Subjects were defined as failing (days 0-12) or recurring (days 13-30) if they experienced a higher AOM-severity score on reexamination.\nRESULTS: A total of 223 subjects were recruited: 73% were nonwhite, 57% were <2 years old, 47% attended day care, 82% had experienced prior AOM, and 83% had not been fully immunized with heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine. One hundred twelve were randomized to ABX, and 111 were randomized to WW. Ninety-four percent of the subjects were followed to the 30-day end point. Parent satisfaction with AOM care was not different between the 2 treatment groups at either day 12 or 30. Compared with WW, symptom scores on days 1 to 10 resolved faster in subjects treated with immediate ABX. At day 12, among the immediate-ABX group, 69% of tympanic membranes and 25% of tympanograms were normal, compared with 51% of normal tympanic membranes and 10% of normal tympanograms in the WW group. Parents of children in the ABX group gave their children fewer doses of pain medication than did parents of children in the WW group. Subjects in the ABX group experienced 16% fewer failures than subjects in the WW group. Of the children in the WW group, 66% completed the study without needing ABX. Immediate ABX resulted in eradication of S pneumoniae carriage in the majority of children, but S pneumoniae strains cultured from children in the ABX group at day 12 were more likely to be multidrug-resistant than strains from children in the WW group. More ABX-related adverse events were noted in the ABX group, compared with the WW group. No serious AOM-related adverse events were observed in either group. Office and emergency department visits, phone calls, and days of work/school missed were not different between groups. Prescriptions for ABX were reduced by 73% in the WW group compared with the ABX group. Costs of ABX averaged $47.41 per subject in the ABX group and $11.43 in the WW group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sixty-six percent of subjects in the WW group completed the study without ABX. Parent satisfaction was the same between groups regardless of treatment. Compared with WW, immediate ABX treatment was associated with decreased numbers of treatment failures and improved symptom control but increased ABX-related adverse events and a higher percent carriage of multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae strains in the nasopharynx at the day-12 visit. Key factors in implementing a WW strategy were (a) a method to classify AOM severity; (b) parent education; (c) management of AOM symptoms; (d) access to follow-up care; and (e) use of an effective ABX regimen, when needed. When these caveats are observed, WW may be an acceptable alternative to immediate ABX for some children with nonsevere AOM."

            "abstract": "Few data exist on the distribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in many countries and in non-invasive disease overall. Here, data are presented from 772 paediatric isolates from children with community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the PROTEKT global surveillance study during 1999-2000. Overall, 60.0 % of isolates were covered by the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine formulation (PCV7), with greater coverage in the USA compared with Europe (69.6 vs 55.5 %, P = 0.014). Geographically dispersed clones of serogroups 3, 11 and 15 accounted for most of the isolates outside PCV7 coverage. Overall, macrolide, penicillin and cotrimoxazole non-susceptibility rates were high; however, all isolates were susceptible to telithromycin. Although only 7.4 % of isolates were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanate, a higher prevalence of resistance was found in isolates from the USA and South Korea.

However, it is believed that nasopharyngeal colonization of pathogenic bacteria leads to childhood CAP, so the etiology is inferred by the isolates obtained from nasopharynx of children with CAP. Among the pathogens of childhood CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) is the most important agent and macrolides resistant SP (MRSP) is increasingly reported. We investigated the characterization of the mechanism of macrolide resistance in isolates of MRSP by the presence of the ermB gene or the mefA gene and clindamycin (CLDM) resistance. In addition, we also assessed the efficacy of azithromycin (AZM) in children with CAP who were isolated MRSP from nasopharynx. During a 6 month period between January and June in 2002, children with CAP who were treated with a 3 day regimen of AZM and isolated SP from nasopharynx were enrolled. Clinical outcome was based on assessment of fever on the fourth day of treatment. MIC measurements were obtained by broth microdilution and interpreted according to NCCLS criteria. 53 patients were enrolled and MRSP were isolated in 41 children. Of 41 MRSP isolates, 25 isolates were identified CLDM resistance. The AZM MIC90 of CLDM resistant MRSP isolates was 128 microg/ml. On the other hand, that of CLDM sensitive MRSP isolates was 8 microg/ml. However, AZM was effective in 20 children isolated CLDM resistant MRSP and 15 out of 16 children isolated CLDM sensitive MRSP. On this background, despite high rates of MRSP in Japan, AZM continues to be clinically effective for the treatment of childhood CAP."

It is, however, important to distinguish between these two post-streptococcal disorders since their response to therapy differs. Children with Sydenham's chorea require long-term benzathine penicillin prophylaxis to reduce the risk of rheumatic heart disease. In contrast, the efficacy of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing tic or obsessive-compulsive symptom exacerbations in children with PANDAS remains doubtful. Immunomodulatory therapies such as plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin have shown to reduce neuropsychiatric symptom severity in children with PANDAS. Tonsillectomy may also represent an effective treatment option in children severely affected by PANDAS. We present this case to demonstrate the pitfalls in differentiating between these two closely associated conditions in a developing country where the prevalence of rheumatic fever is high."

However, compliance with 10-day courses is bad. Shorter therapeutic courses are necessary, especially in young children.\nMETHODS: In a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, children aged 1-17 years with acute tonsillopharyngitis and a positive culture for GABHS were treated with cefuroxime axetil (CAE) 20 mg/kg/day (max. 500 mg) b.i.d. for 5 days or with PenV 50,000 IU/kg (30 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 10 days. Patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy 2-4 and 7-9 days after the end of therapy. Throat swabs were taken 2-4 days after the end of therapy and at the first follow-up visit. Follow-up visits were carried out 7-8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after study inclusion.\nRESULTS: 1,952 patients (CAE for 5 days, 496 patients/PenV for 10 days, 1,456 patients) could be included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Two to 4 days after completion of the treatment course, the bacteriological eradication in group A (1-5 years) and group B (6-17 years) was 90.52 and 89.53% (CAE) vs. 84.13 and 84.20% (PenV), respectively; p = 0.0172; 0.0382; clinical success was 98.30% (CAE) versus 93.25% (PenV), p = 0.0017. Recurrent infections were significantly higher in younger children (group A) under both treatment regimens. Poststreptococcal sequelae (glomerulonephritis) were observed in only 1 case, in the PenV group.\nCONCLUSIONS: CAE b.i.d. for 5 days was at least as effective as PenV t.i.d. for 10 days. Incountries with a low incidence of rheumatic fever, CAE for 5 days can be recommended for the therapy of tonsillopharyngitis due to GABHS - also in young children."

All patients received oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 7 to 10 days. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of moxifloxacin and penicillin were determined using the E-test and standard broth-microdilution methods. The primary end point was clinical success at the test-of-cure visit (21-37 days after completion of therapy) in patients with a positive pretherapy sinus culture. Data are presented for patients with ABS caused by both PSSP and PRSP RESULTS: Of 806 patients enrolled in the 2 studies, 146 had microbiologically confirmed bacterial infection. Sixty-nine patients had ABS caused by S pneumoniae, including 15 confirmed cases of PRSP infection. The majority of the 69 clinically evaluable patients were white (n = 63) and female (n = 46), and the mean age of this population was 43 years. Investigators categorized the episode of ABS as severe in 26 (37.7%) of clinically evaluable patients and of moderate severity in the remainder (62.3% [43]); however, most patients (78.3% [54/69]) reported >/=1 severe symptom. The episode of ABS was classified as severe in 8 (53.3%) of the 15 patients with PRSP infection. Clinical and bacteriologic success at the test-of-cure visit was achieved in 93.3% (14/15) of patients with PRSP infection, compared with 88.4% (61/69) of all patients infected with S pneumoniae regardless of penicillin susceptibility. Moxifloxacin MICs against the 15 PRSP strains ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 microg/mL. Data from 805 patients were available for tolerability analysis. The most commonly occurring adverse events were nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Generally, adverse events were mild to moderate. None of the 6 serious adverse events reported were considered related to moxifloxacin therapy.\nCONCLUSION: In this small cohort of patients, moxifloxacin provided clinical and bacteriologic cures in the majority of patients with ABS caused by PRSP, including those with severe sinusitis."

            "title": "Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.",
            "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Treatment guidelines developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) were originally published in 2000. These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients\u2019 families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options.\nBURDEN OF DISEASE: An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States.\nDEFINITION AND DIAGNOSIS OF ABRS: ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a \u201ccommon cold\u201d (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the \u201cnorm\u201d of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS.\nMICROBIOLOGY OF ABRS: The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, the latter being more common in children. Other streptococcal species, anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus cause a small percentage of cases.\nBACTERIAL RESISTANCE IN ABRS: The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among S pneumoniae has been a problem in the United States, with 15% being penicillin-intermediate and 25% being penicillin-resistant in recent studies. Resistance to macrolides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also common in S pneumoniae. The prevalence of \u03b2-lactamase-producing isolates of H influenzae is approximately 30%, while essentially all M catarrhalis isolates produce \u03b2-lactamases. Resistance of H influenzae to TMP/SMX is also common.\nANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR ABRS: These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms\u2014patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient\u2019s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel\u2019s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at \u226572 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on H influenzae and M catarrhalis coverage), cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir, and TMP/SMX; 77% to 81% = doxycycline, clindamycin (based on gram-positive coverage only), azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin, and telithromycin; 65% to 66% = cefaclor and loracarbef. The predicted spontaneous resolution rate in patients with a clinical diagnosis of ABRS is 62%. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy in children with ABRS: 91% to 92% = ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (45 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day); 82% to 87% = high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day), amoxicillin (45 mg/kg per day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on H influenzae and M catarrhalis coverage only), cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir, and TMP/SMX; and 78% to 80% = clindamycin (based on gram-positive coverage only), cefprozil, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin; 67% to 68% = cefaclor and loracarbef. The predicted spontaneous resolution rate in untreated children with a presumed diagnosis of ABRS is 63%. Recommendations for initial therapy for adult patients with mild disease (who have not received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks) include the following choices: amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 to 4 g/250 mg per day), amoxicillin (1.5 to 4 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir. While TMP/SMX, doxycycline, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or telithromycin may be considered for patients with \u03b2-lactam allergies, bacteriologic failure rates of 20% to 25% are possible. Failure to respond to antimicrobial therapy after 72 hours should prompt either a switch to alternate antimicrobial therapy or reevaluation of the patient (see Table 4).When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial agent. Recommendations for initial therapy for adults with mild disease who have received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks or adults with moderate disease include the following choices: respiratory fluoroquinolone (eg, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg per day). The widespread use of respiratory fluoroquinolones for patients with milder disease may promote resistance of a wide spectrum of organisms to this class of agents. Ceftriaxone (parenteral, 1 to 2 g/day for 5 days) or combination therapy with adequate gram-positive and negative coverage may also be considered. Examples of appropriate regimens of combination therapy include high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus rifampin. While the clinical effectiveness of ceftriaxone and these combinations for ABRS is unproven; the panel considers these reasonable therapeutic options based on the spectrum of activity of these agents and on data extrapolated from acute otitis media studies. Rifampin should not be used as monotherapy, casually, or for longer than 10 to 14 days, as resistance quickly develops to this agent. Rifampin is also a well-known inducer of several cytochrome p450 isoenzymes and therefore has a high potential for drug interactions. Failure of a patient to respond to antimicrobial therapy after 72 hours of therapy should prompt either a switch to alternate antimicrobial therapy or reevaluation of the patient (see Table 4). When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial agent. Patients who have received effective antibiotic therapy and continue to be symptomatic may need further evaluation. A CT scan, fiberoptic endoscopy or sinus aspiration and culture may be necessary. Recommendations for initial therapy for children with mild disease and who have not received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks include the following: high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day), amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir. TMP/SMX, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin is recommended if the patient has a history of immediate Type I hypersensitivity reaction to \u03b2-lactams. These antibiotics have limited effectiveness against the major pathogens of ABRS and bacterial failure of 20% to 25% is possible. The clinician should differentiate an immediate hypersensitivity reaction from other less dangerous side effects. Children with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to \u03b2-lactams may need: desensitization, sinus cultures, or other ancillary procedures and studies. Children with other types of reactions and side effects may tolerate one specific \u03b2-lactam, but not another. Failure to respond to antimicrobial therapy after 72 hours should prompt either a switch to alternate antimicrobial therapy or reevaluation of the patient (see Table 5).When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial agent. The recommended initial therapy for children with mild disease who have received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks or children with moderate disease is high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day). Cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir may be used if there is a penicillin allergy (eg, penicillin rash); in such instances, cefdinir is preferred because of high patient acceptance. TMP/SMX, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin is recommended if the patient is \u03b2-lactam allergic, but these do not provide optimal coverage. Clindamycin is appropriate if S pneumoniae is identified as a pathogen. Ceftriaxone (parenteral, 50 mg/kg per day for 5 days) or combination therapy with adequate gram-positive and -negative coverage may also be considered. Examples of appropriate regimens of combination therapy include high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus rifampin. The clinical effectiveness of ceftriaxone and these combinations for ABRS is unproven; the panel considers these reasonable therapeutic options based on spectrum of activity and on data extrapolated from acute otitis media studies.

            "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant worldwide, and thus new antimicrobials are badly needed. We report the use of Cpl-1, the lytic enzyme of a pneumococcal bacteriophage, as an intravenous therapy for pneumococcal bacteremia in a mouse model. A 2000- microg dose of Cpl-1 reduced pneumococcal titers from a median of log(10) 4.70 CFU/ml to undetectable levels (<log(10) 2.00 CFU/ml) within 15 min. This dose given 1 h after intravenous infection led to 100% survival at 48 h, compared to the 20% survival of buffer-treated controls. In advanced bacteremia, treatment with two doses at 5 and 10 h still resulted in significantly longer survival (P < 0.0001) and a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.35). The enzyme is immunogenic, but the treatment efficacy was not significantly diminished after previous intravenous exposure of mice and hyperimmune rabbit serum did not neutralize the activity. Cpl-1 is also very effective as a topical nasal treatment against colonization by S. pneumoniae. In vitro, the enzyme is active against many serotypes of S. pneumoniae, independent of their penicillin resistance, and it is very specific for this species. Bacteriophage enzymes are unusual but extremely effective antimicrobials and represent a new weapon against infections with resistant bacteria."

The authors reported on the nasopharyngeal flora in children treated with macrolide therapy.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.\nMETHODS: Nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from 73 children with chronic rhinosinusitis and/or otitis media with effusion at the end of the low-dose administration of clarithromycin (macrolide group). As control subjects, 98 children with chronic rhinosinusitis and/or otitis media with effusion who were not given macrolides were also included in the study. The culture results were evaluated with respect to antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, risk factors for carriage of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the clinical efficacy of the therapy.\nRESULTS: The macrolide therapy did not have a significant effect on the incidence or the susceptibility patterns of potential pathogens except for Moraxella catarrhalis. Most of children in the macrolide group possessed a normal flora compared with the control children. The risk factors for carriage of erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae were male gender in the macrolide group and age under 6 years and use of antimicrobial drugs other than macrolides in the control group. The clinical efficacy of the therapy was independent of carriage of erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae.\nCONCLUSION: Macrolide therapy has little effect on carriage of drug-resistant pathogens, and the efficacy of the therapy depends on the anti-inflammatory effect of the drugs, which is independent of their antimicrobial effect."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharyngotonsillitis (PT) caused by group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is one of the most common infections of childhood. Two antibiotic suspensions, cefaclor (CEF) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC), are commonly used in Poland for the treatment of PT caused by GABHS in children.\nMATERIAL/METHODS: This multi-center, randomized, single-blinded study was undertaken in order to compare the efficacy and safety of CEF (20 mg/kg/d) and AMC (25 mg/kg/d) in 10 days treatment of GABHS-related PT. 100 children (mean age 6 years) were enrolled into the study. Clinical and bacteriological assessments were done on the 14-18 th, and 38-45 th days after randomization.\nRESULTS: No GABHS strain isolated from throat smears was resistant in vitro to both antibiotics. Both antibiotics had almost 98% effectiveness at the post therapy visit. On follow-up, significantly more relapses and recurrences were observed in the AMC-treated group than in the CEF-treated group (relapse rate 21.28% vs 15.56%, p<0.02, recurrence 10.64% vs 6.66%, p<0.002). The relapse odds ratio in the AMC group was 1.7 times greater than in the CEF group, and recurrence was 1.5 times higher. There were significantly higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events in children treated by AMC (p<0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: CEF provides a clinically and bacteriologically effective treatment for children with PT caused by GABHS, comparable to AMC but significantly safer in terms of gastrointestinal side effects. AMC shows a greater risk of relapse and recurrence than CEF."

Patients aged 15-65 y (n = 395) with clinical signs and symptoms of pharyngitis/tonsillitis and a positive streptococcal antigen test or throat culture for GABHS were randomized to receive either telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 5 d (n = 198) or penicillin V 500 mg three times daily for 10 d (n = 197). Clinical and bacteriologic outcomes were assessed at post-therapy, test-of-cure (Days 16-20) and late post-therapy (Days 38-45) visits. Telithromycin for 5 d was equivalent to 10 d of penicillin V in terms of bacteriologic and clinical outcome (per-protocol): at post-therapy, test-of-cure visit, bacteriologic outcome was satisfactory in 84.3% and 89.1% of patients in the telithromycin and penicillin V groups, respectively, while clinical cure was achieved in 94.8% and 94.1% of patients, respectively. At late post-therapy, 82.4% of patients treated with telithromycin achieved a satisfactory bacteriologic outcome, compared with 84.7% of penicillin V recipients. The GABHS eradication rates for telithromycin and penicillin post-therapy were 85.2% and 89.1%, respectively, and 86.1% and 86.5%, respectively at late post-therapy. Both treatments were well tolerated, with a similar overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Short-course (5 d) therapy with telithromycin 800 mg once daily is comparable to a standard 10 d course of penicillin V for the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis/tonsillitis in adults and adolescents."

            "abstract": "Although regular physical exercise lowers the risk of coronary heart disease in both primary and secondary prevention populations, physical exercise may be difficult for some individuals, prompting the need for alternative therapies. This study is a sub-analysis of a previously completed clinical trial that aimed to assess the effect of singing on cardiac biomarkers. The previous trial included 60 patients recruited from a cardiology clinic (mean age 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years; 68\u00a0% women) with measurements of vascular endothelial function and heart rate variability (HRV), and the results showed that 14\u00a0min of singing improves endothelial function acutely, similar to a short bout of physical exercise. The present sub-analysis examined whether predictive variables (prior singing experience, gender, age, enjoyment level, effort, smoking history) impacted changes in outcome measures. No significant change was seen in endothelial function or HRV based on exposure variables except for smoking status. Past smoking (compared to never smoking) predicted improvement in vascular endothelial function after singing. Abnormal baseline endothelial function was a predictor of acute improvement in endothelial function. These findings suggest that singing may have beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function, especially in patients with abnormal baseline endothelial function, regardless of singing experience."

            "abstract": "Multimorbidity, i.e. the simultaneous presence of 2 or more diseases, is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke or vascular dementia are of particular importance. CKD and comorbidities influence each other, which is why the current KDIGO guidelines emphasize the need for personalized treatment approaches. This applies in particular to older patients, who are especially frequently affected by CKD. The diagnosis of CKD patients should not only include typical comorbidities, but also a comprehensive risk assessment and an evaluation to avoid polypharmacy.Recognising CKD is of particular importance for patients with chronic diseases in old age, as kidney disease can have a profound effect on or worsen the course of other diseases and the limitation of kidney function has a significant influence on the treatment approach. Particular attention must be paid to the correct assessment of kidney function in older people in terms of determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Here, a measurement of serum creatinine is not always sufficient due to lower muscle mass and may need to be supplemented by additional parameters to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, such as cystatin C.Depending on the eGFR, kidney disease is categorized into the stages CKD G1-G5. In addition, if kidney disease is suspected, a test for proteinuria should also be performed, preferably as a measurement of albumin excretion in spontaneous urine (albumin-to-creatinine ratio, ACR). Geriatric screening and assessment are also crucial to recognize the multimorbidity, frailty and psychosocial aspects of older patients.The treatment of multimorbidity in CKD patients focusses on progression reduction and secondary and tertiary prevention, whereby a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise and a balanced diet are also important. The prevention of cardiovascular disease, particularly in the case of high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus, requires individualized therapy, in which the choice and dosage of medication must also be taken into account, particularly in the case of advanced renal impairment. If heart failure and/or atrial fibrillation are also present, close interdisciplinary collaboration between nephrologists, cardiologists and GPs is helpful in order to optimize treatment. In addition, CKD patients with dementia face particular challenges in terms of medication and the avoidance of delirium and mental symptoms."

Advances in CIED therapy have led to an increasing number of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) receiving such devices. In general, low levels of physical activity are associated with a higher risk of cardiac and all-cause mortality in patients with CIED. These patients are considered eligible for exercise programs not only to improve prognosis related to their underlying heart disease but also to facilitate psychological adaptation to living with the device, to enhance evaluation of device performance and, particularly in ICD recipients, to reduce the risk of inappropriate shocks. Studies have shown that exercise training improves physical performance in CIED patients without increasing the risk of adverse events. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, a personalized exercise plan, appropriate device programming, and regular follow-up are essential to ensure that patients can safely engage in effective physical activity tailored to their specific needs. Participation in sports is another consideration for many CIED patients. Recent guidelines recommend encouraging individuals with CIEDs to engage in sports activities, unless contraindicated by their underlying heart conditions. It is generally accepted that low- to moderate-intensity leisure-time sports activities are safe and clinically beneficial for most individuals with a CIED. However, individualized recommendations may vary significantly depending on the patient's cardiovascular health, the impact of physical activity on their underlying disease, and the type of implanted device."

            "title": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome",
            "abstract": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is characterized in the first year of life by growth deficiency, lagophthalmos, hair loss, delayed and incomplete primary tooth eruption, subcutaneous fat loss, and areas of abnormal skin (tightness, stippling, and/or small outpouchings over the abdomen and upper thighs). Motor and mental development is normal. Children have profound growth failure, subcutaneous lipodystrophy, total alopecia, high-pitched voice, nail dystrophy, horse-riding stance, coxa valga with possible hip dislocations, narrowed upper thorax, and progressive joint contractures. Characteristic facial features include disproportionately large head for the face, narrow nasal ridge, narrow nasal tip, thin vermilion of the lips, small mouth, retro- and micrognathia, delayed loss of primary teeth, and partial secondary tooth eruption. Additional features include low-frequency conductive hearing loss, dry eye with risk of exposure keratitis, and premature and accelerated atherosclerosis with cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Without lonafarnib treatment death occurs at an average age of 14.5 years (range: 6-20 years). With lonafarnib treatment average life span is extended to approximately 18.7 years.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of classic or nonclassic genotype HGPS is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LMNA that results in production of progerin, the disease-causing abnormal lamin A protein, identified by molecular genetic testing. Individuals with classic genotype HGPS are heterozygous for pathogenic variant c.1824C&gt;T (~90% of individuals). Individuals with nonclassic genotype HGPS are heterozygous for another LMNA pathogenic variant in exon 11 or intron 11 that results in production of progerin (~10% of individuals).\nMANAGEMENT: Targeted therapy: Lonafarnib results in increase in life span presumably due to slowed cardiovascular disease progression that includes improved arterial wall stiffness and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. The therapy also improves low-tone hearing and may decrease headache frequency. Side effects are primarily gastrointestinal and vary in severity and duration. Supportive care: Frequent small meals to maximize caloric intake; daily multivitamin; medication dosages are based on body weight or body surface area, not age; shoe pads for foot discomfort; school adaptations for short stature. General anesthesia and intubation should be performed with extreme caution, with fiberoptic intubation if possible. Fluoride supplementation as needed; if secondary teeth erupt palatally displaced, primary tooth extractions after the secondary teeth have erupted and/or fully descended may be required to avoid dental crowding. Sunscreen on exposed areas of skin, including the head, during outdoor activities; encourage sun-protective clothing including hat. Hip dislocation is best managed with physical therapy and body bracing; reconstructive hip surgery is possible, but comorbidities of surgery in this high-risk population should be considered. Routine treatment for bone fractures; physical and occupational therapy to maintain joint mobility, active stretching and strengthening exercises, and hydrotherapy. Though menstruation is highly variable, in females with excessive pubertal vaginal bleeding, short-term low-dose oral contraceptives can be used to decrease blood loss. Healthy diet with regular physical activity as tolerated; maintain optimal hydration, especially during hot weather and airplane travel. Low-dose aspirin to prevent cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. Nitroglycerin can be beneficial for angina; anti-congestive therapy is routine for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Modified transcatheter aortic valve replacement or modified apico-aortic valve replacement are high-risk interventions to treat critical aortic stenosis. Exercise, diet modification, and statin therapy as needed for hyperlipidemia. Hearing aids can be used when clinically necessary. Exposure keratopathy can be treated with ocular lubrication. Social work and family support. Surveillance: Assess growth, caloric intake, skin manifestations, and family needs at each visit. Blood pressure, EKG, echocardiogram, and carotid scan every six to 12 months. Dental examination with radiographs, orthopedic evaluation, occupational and physical therapy assessment, lipid profile, neurologic assessment with head and neck MRI/MRA, and ophthalmology and audiology evaluation annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Large crowds with taller and/or larger peers because of the risk of injury; trampolines and bouncy houses due to risk of hip dislocation; dehydration, anemia, and high fever because of cardiac and stroke risks; calcium supplementation because of extraskeletal calcium deposits.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: HGPS is an autosomal dominant disorder. Ninety-eight percent of individuals with HGPS have the disorder as the result of a de novo LMNA pathogenic variant. Approximately 2% of individuals have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from an unaffected parent with gonadal mosaicism. Because HGPS is typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, the recurrence risk to the sibs of a proband is low but not zero because of the possibility of parental gonadal mosaicism. Once the LMNA pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

However, the association between CVH and biomarkers of neurodegeneration remains less understood.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of CVH with serum biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau).\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted within the biracial, population-based Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) of adults aged 65 years or older between 1993 and 2012. Participants who had measured serum NfL and t-tau levels and data on all components of the CVH score were included. The statistical analysis was conducted from April 10 to September 26, 2024.\nEXPOSURE: The CVH score includes 7 components: a healthy diet; regular exercise; normal body mass index; nonsmoking status; and the absence of dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. The scores were divided into 3 groups from lowest to highest CVH (0-6 points, 7-9 points, and 10-14 points).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the association of CVH score with serum biomarkers of NfL and t-tau as measured using linear regression and mixed-effects models.\nRESULTS: A total of 1018 CHAP participants were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [6.1] years; 625 female [61.4%]; 610 Black or African American [59.9%] and 408 White [40.1%]). Participants with a high CVH score (ie, 10-14 points) were predominantly White (151 [64.3%]) and had a higher education (mean [SD], 13.6 [3.7] years). Compared with participants with low CVH scores (ie, 0-6 points), those with CVH scores of 10 to 14 points had significantly lower serum levels of NfL (relative difference, -18.9%; \u03b2 = -0.091; SE, 0.025). A higher CVH score was associated with a slower annual increase in NfL levels as participants aged (relative difference in rate, -1.7%; \u03b2 = -0.008; SE, 0.004). Cardiovascular health was not associated with serum levels of t-tau.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that promoting CVH in older adults may help alleviate the burden of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly among Black adults, who are known to experience a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease."

Self-reported leisure-time physical activity levels at baseline (1986-2010) were categorised as low (no or very little), intermediate (between low and recommended levels), and WHO-recommended (\u22652\u00b75 h of moderate or \u22651\u00b725 h of vigorous physical activity per week).

For the UK Biobank sample, 9\u2008238\u2008453 million individuals were invited, 8\u2008736\u2008094 (94\u00b76%) were non-respondents, and 502\u2008359 participated in the baseline examination. After the exclusion of 73\u2008460 participants, 428\u2008899 participants had data on at least one measure of physical activity. 236\u2008258 (55\u00b71%) were female and 192\u2008641 (44\u00b79%) were male. During 1\u00b76 million person-years at risk, 21\u2008231 IPD-Work participants developed a non-communicable disease, while 101\u2008319 UK Biobank participants developed a non-communicable disease over 4\u00b78 million person-years at risk. Compared with individuals with low physical activity, those meeting the recommended physical activity levels during leisure-time gained an additional 1\u00b71 (95% CI 1\u00b70-1\u00b72) to 2\u00b70 (1\u00b77-2\u00b73) disease-free years, depending on sex and study. In males from the IPD-Work and UK Biobank cohorts, greater gains in disease-free years were observed in current smokers (2\u00b74 [95% CI 2\u00b71-2\u00b78]) versus never smokers (0\u00b77 [0\u00b75-0\u00b79]); those with low education (1\u00b74 [1\u00b71-1\u00b77]) versus high education (0\u00b78 [0\u00b77-1\u00b70]); low socioeconomic status (1\u00b77 [1\u00b75-2\u00b70]) versus high socioeconomic status (0\u00b79 [0\u00b77-1\u00b71]); and those with (1\u00b76 [1\u00b73-1\u00b79]) versus without depressive symptoms (1\u00b70 [0\u00b79-1\u00b71]; p value range <0\u00b70001-0\u00b70008). Similar differences were seen in women for smoking (2\u00b73 [95% CI 1\u00b79-2\u00b77] vs 0\u00b79 [0\u00b77-1\u00b71]), socioeconomic status (1\u00b77 [1\u00b74-2\u00b70] vs 0\u00b78 [0\u00b75-1\u00b70]), depressive symptoms (1\u00b74 [1\u00b71-1\u00b77] vs 1\u00b70 [0\u00b79-1\u00b71]), and for heavy drinkers compared with moderate drinkers (1\u00b74 [1\u00b71-1\u00b76] vs 0\u00b79 [0\u00b77-1\u00b71]; p value range <0\u00b70001-0\u00b7010). No differences in physical activity-related health gains were observed between risk groups and non-risk groups by BMI, history of depression, and, in men, alcohol use (p value range 0\u00b711-0\u00b786).\nINTERPRETATION: In addition to confirming the association between leisure-time physical activity and increased disease-free years across population subgroups, our findings show that these health benefits are often more pronounced among individuals with pre-existing health risks or disadvantaged backgrounds than in those with more favourable risk factor profiles. This suggests that enhancing population-wide physical activity initiatives could help reduce health disparities, while incorporating physical activity into targeted strategies addressing social disadvantage, unhealthy lifestyles, and depression might enhance their effectiveness.\nFUNDING: Wellcome Trust, UK Medical Research Council, US National Institute on Aging, and Research Council of Finland."

            "title": "Exercise Intervention to Mitigate the Cardiovascular Sequence of Pregnancy Complications.",
            "abstract": "Pregnancy issues such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are significant contributors to long-term cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in women. Recent research has proved the impact of exercise on improving cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in women with pregnancy-related disorders. This review explores the outcomes of various exercise interventions on cardiovascular health in pregnant women. Among these, aerobic exercise has been widely studied, with results from observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing its positive outcomes on cardiovascular health in pregnant women, especially with complications. It has been found that regular aerobic exercise has been associated with reduced hypertension and improved endothelial function, particularly in women with a history of preeclampsia. Evidently, aerobic exercise results in better blood pressure regulation and enhanced vascular health that directly attends to the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with pregnancy complications. Another form of exercise is resistance training, which despite being studied less, has shown potential benefits as well. Some advantages of resistance exercise have been found to improve muscle strength and overall enhancement in metabolic control. This is important, especially in women with GDM whereby improvement in insulin sensitivity reduces the overall risk of type 2 diabetes and future CVDs. Combined exercise that incorporates both aerobic and resistance elements\u00a0has been known to offer the most comprehensive benefits. Various studies suggest that a combinatory approach maximizes the positive cardiovascular effects. Practicing women have experienced better overall heart health, with improved blood pressure regulation, enhanced endothelial function, and reduced metabolic risks. However, despite these findings, there are challenges such as small sample sizes and limited follow-up durations that hinder the generalizability of current research. Importantly, previous studies targeting exercise interventions for women experiencing complications during pregnancy have been limited in evidence by small sample sizes, short follow-ups, and lack of diversity. Such broader, more diverse populations were needed to reflect the various health risks and responses to exercise. Future research must include multi-center RCTs, diverse exercise regimens, and digital health tools for monitoring exercise adherence. This warrants future large-scale, multicenter trials that are necessary to establish more definitive evidence. Additionally, clinicians should consider including tailored exercise programs in care plans for women with pregnancy complications to mitigate long-term cardiovascular risks."

The aim of this narrative review was to present a summary of the latest recommendations for physical activity, and to evaluate the most recent scientific evidence regarding the role of aerobic and or resistance exercise in relation to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.\nMETHODS: Narrative review; searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar. The guidelines of major Organizations (i.e., European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association, American College of Sports Medicine, and World Heart Federation, World Heart Organization) were also retrieved and presented here.\nRESULTS: Engagement in regular aerobic exercise is strongly recommended for all people and by all scientific organizations for reducing ASCVD mortality and morbidity. Resistance exercise should be implemented in addition to aerobic, however, its individual effects on ASCVD risk are not well established.\nCONCLUSIONS: A reduction of sedentary behavior at population level reduces the healthcare costs by multiple ways. Effective approaches should be implemented that include behavior theory-based interventions, e.g., goal-setting, re-evaluation of goals, self-monitoring, and feedback. Most important is to encourage activity that individuals enjoy and/or can be included in their daily life."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Balancing the well-documented benefits of regular exercise, particularly its positive impact on cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, with the potential risks for patients with aortic aneurysms presents a significant challenge. This narrative review aims to summarize the current evidence and guidelines to assist clinicians in making informed exercise and sports recommendations for patients with aortic aneurysms or post-aortic repair.\nMETHODS: Nine clinical trials on the effect of exercise on abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) were identified, including one study on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in AAA patients. As no clinical trials on exercise in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) were found, we extrapolated data from other studies on exercise in aortic diseases, including data from patients who have had an aortic dissection, as well as three studies on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and one study on CPET after proximal aortic repair. Review articles and guidelines were also incorporated to ensure a comprehensive overview of the topic.\nRESULTS: Currently, no clear correlation exists between intense sports activities and the development of aortic aneurysms or dissections.\nCONCLUSIONS: Light to moderate physical activity appears safe and beneficial for patients with aortic aneurysms and post-aortic repair. Given the lack of evidence linking athletic activity to aortic complications, caution is warranted in restricting such activities for athletes, underscoring the importance of shared decision-making. Regular follow-up and optimal management of cardiovascular risk factors are essential."

Patients in the control group were managed by the conventional continuity of care model, and those in the observation group were managed by the case management model that breaks through the temporal and spatial characteristics. Both groups of patients were intervened and followed up for 6\u2005months, comparing the adherence to home II exercise rehabilitation and regular follow-ups, coronary heart disease risk factor indexes, unplanned readmission rate, and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events between the two groups of patients.\nRESULTS: Exercise adherence and regular follow-up adherence of patients discharged from the hospital at 1, 3, and 6\u2005months after PCI were higher in the observation group than in the control group (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). The comparison of risk factor indicators of patients in both groups at 6\u2005months after discharge with those of patients before discharge showed different degrees of improvement, and the difference was statistically significant (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). However, the difference in fasting blood glucose in the control group at 6\u2005months after discharge compared with that before discharge was statistically significant (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05), whereas there was no statistical significance in the observation group (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.05). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and unplanned readmission at 6\u2005months after discharge between the two groups was lower in the observation group than in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: The case management mode that breaks through the spatiotemporal characteristics can improve the exercise adherence and regular follow-up adherence of post-PCI patients' at-home phase II exercise rehabilitation, which can effectively control the indexes of body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduce the rate of unplanned readmission and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events."

Regular aerobic exercise (AE) has been widely accepted as an effective intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in a variety of different clinical conditions. This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of AE on cardiovascular risk factors in female BC and assessing the quality of the synthesized evidence.\nMETHODS: We searched five English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) from inception to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort trials studying the effects of AE intervention on cardiovascular disease risk in female breast cancer were included. We used Stata 16 for data synthesis, Risk of Bias 2, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for methodological quality evaluation and assessed the certainty of the synthesized evidence in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.\nRESULTS: Forty RCTs and 6 cohort trials involving 44,877 BC patients showed AE reduced the incidence of CVD events by 29.4% [risk ratio (RR)\u2009=\u20090.706, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.659, 0.757), low certainty] and coronary artery disease events by 36% [RR\u2009=\u20090.640, 95% CI (0.561, 0.729), low certainty]. AE improved LVEF, and reduced weight and hip circumference. The subgroup analysis results showed that nonlinear AE increased VO<sub>2</sub>max by 5.354 ml\u00b7kg\u00b7min-1 [mean difference (MD)\u2009=\u20095.354, 95% CI (2.645, 8.062), very low certainty] and reduced fat mass by 4.256 kg [MD\u2009=\u20094.256, 95% CI (-3.839, -0.094), very low certainty]. While linear AE reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 8.534 mg/dL [MD\u2009=\u2009-8.534, 95% CI (-15.511, -1.557), low certainty]. The sensitivity analysis results showed that each trial did not affect the impact index of the highly heterogeneous outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that AE has a positive effect in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. The individualization principle of AE deserves more attention in the future. This will provide new ideas to reduce CVD events and improve the quality of life in female BC patients. However, further research on AE in female BC should take into account long-term and well-designed administration to draw definitive conclusions."

Meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize the prevalence of risk factors and compare it with that of the general population, where applicable.\nRESULTS: We identified 62 studies (30 controlled) encompassing 110,469 ACHD (mean age 39\u00a0years; 52% males, 88% with simple/moderate congenital heart disease complexity). Of these, 54% (45%-63%) reported lack of regular exercise, 33% (26%-40%) had hypertension, 18% (14%-22%) were obese, 17% (11%-25%) had dyslipidemia, 12% (9%-14%) were current smokers, and 7% (5%-9%) had DM. The prevalence of ASCVD risk factors was similar in ACHD and controls, with the exception of DM (higher prevalence in ACHD) and smoking (lower prevalence in ACHD). Significant heterogeneity was observed among the included studies, partially explained by differences in age, congenital heart disease complexity, and the presence of cyanosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Except for DM and smoking, the prevalence of traditional ASCVD risk factors is similar in ACHD compared to the general population. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions applied in the\u00a0general population are also effective in ACHD."

            "abstract": "Guidelines encouraging social distancing, limited outings, and remote work due to COVID-19 have increased sedentary periods and reduced levels of physical activity. These habits increase the risk of metabolic diseases, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. The World Health Organization recommends muscle-strengthening exercises as well as regular physical activity to promote overall health. This study investigates the effect of a wearable hip exoskeleton on muscle activity and heart rate during anaerobic exercise in 40 healthy adults (mean age of 40.00\u2009\u00b1\u200911.51 years; n\u2009=\u200920 females). Bot Fit, a wearable hip-type robotic exoskeleton, was developed by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Suwon, Republic of Korea) to enhance the effects of both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. All study participants performed a fitness exercise protocol, including knee-ups, good mornings, squats, mountain climbs, kick-backs, reverse lunges, and split jacks, with and without a Bot Fit. To evaluate the effect of anaerobic exercise with the Bot Fit, muscle activity and heart rate were measured during fitness exercises with and without a Bot Fit. Measured muscles were the rectus abdominis (RA), erector spinae (ES), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius medialis (GCM), and gluteus maximus (GM). During anaerobic exercises with the Bot Fit, there was a significant increase in muscle activity compared to exercising without the Bot Fit. Muscle activity increased significantly in the RA, RF, VL, BF and TA muscles during knee-ups; in the ES, BF, and GM during good mornings; in the RF, VL, VM, BF, and GM during squats; in RA, RF, VL, VM, and GM during mountain climbs; in the RA and BF during kick-backs; in the RF, BF, and GCM during reverse lunges; and in the RF and VL during split jacks (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Heart rates showed a statistically significant increase during good mornings, mountain climbs, and reverse lunge exercises while wearing the Bot Fit (p\u2009<\u20090.05). This study demonstrated that anaerobic exercises by healthy adults using a Bot Fit led to enhanced activation of abdominal and lower-limb muscles as well as an improved heart rate, maximizing the effect of anaerobic exercise compared with the same exercise protocol without a Bot Fit. This suggests that use of a Bot Fit can increase the effectiveness of anaerobic exercise in healthy adults."

Harnessing social influences in daily life shows promise: digital micro-interventions could effectively engage these influences on PA and require testing.\nPURPOSE: This feasibility study employed ecological momentary assessment with embedded micro-randomization to activate two types of social influences (i.e., comparison, support; NCT04711512).\nMETHODS: Midlife adults (N = 30, MAge = 51, MBMI = 31.5 kg/m2, 43% racial/ethnic minority) with \u22651 CVD risk conditions completed four mobile surveys per day for 7 days while wearing PA monitors. After 3 days of observation, participants were randomized at each survey to receive 1 of 3 comparison micro-interventions (days 4-5) or 1 of 3 support micro-interventions (days 6-7). Outcomes were indicators of feasibility (e.g., completion rate), acceptability (e.g., narrative feedback), and potential micro-intervention effects (on motivation and steps within-person).\nRESULTS: Feasibility and acceptability targets were met (e.g., 93% completion); ratings of micro-intervention helpfulness varied by intervention type and predicted PA motivation and behavior within-person (srs=0.16, 0.27). Participants liked the approach and were open to ongoing micro-intervention exposure. Within-person, PA motivation and behavior increased from baseline in response to specific micro-interventions (srs=0.23, 0.13), though responses were variable.\nCONCLUSIONS: Experimental manipulation of social influences in daily life is feasible and acceptable to midlife adults and shows potential effects on PA motivation and behavior. Findings support larger-scale testing of this approach to inform a digital, socially focused PA intervention for midlife adults."

The participants underwent three standardized aerobic exercise tests (100%, 80%, and 60% of the maximal heart rate) on a bicycle ergometer. Blood samples were collected to determine cholesterol, triacylglycerols, glucose, serum creatinine (Cr), Cystatin C (CysC) concentrations, and eGFR.\nRESULTS: eGFR and serum concentrations of Cr and CysC were not modified at any exercise intensity. There was a negative correlation between blood total cholesterol vs. eGFR (R = -0.512, R = -0.582, R = -0.531; p &lt; 0.05) at rest, 60%, and 100% of the maximal heart rate, respectively. In addition, a negative correlation existed for age vs. eGFR at 60% of the maximal heart rate (R = -0.516; p &lt; 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Short-duration aerobic exercise of low, moderate, and vigorous intensity did not significantly affect eGFR and is considered safe for kidney function in healthy, sedentary older adults. However, regular monitoring of kidney function in older people engaged in moderate- and high-intensity exercise is advised."

However, its association with the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains largely unexplored.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: 451,089 participants (mean age 56.5 years) without cardiovascular disease (year 2006-2010) were included from the UK Biobank study. Stair climbing data was collected through touchscreen questionnaire. AF cases were identified using ICD-10 code: I48 and were followed until February 1, 2022. Models adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Over a median follow-up of 12.6 years, 23,660 (5.2\u00a0%) participants experienced new-onset AF. In multivariable-adjusted models, climbing 10-50, 60-100, 110-150, and \u2265160 steps of stairs per day were associated with significant reductions in the risk of AF, compared to not climbing any stairs. The risk reduction appeared more pronounced in women than in men (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.09). When compared to participants who climbed no stairs, the HRs for those who climbed 110-150 steps of stairs per day were 0.69 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.58-0.82) among those with low cardiorespiratory fitness, 0.71 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.57-0.88) among those with intermediate cardiorespiratory fitness, and 0.83 (95\u00a0% CI: 0.64-1.07) among those with high cardiorespiratory fitness.\nCONCLUSIONS: Climbing stairs was associated with a reduction in AF risks. Significant interaction between cardiorespiratory fitness and stair climbing associated with incident AF was observed.

However, how different PA levels either below (<\u2009600 MET min/week), within (600-1200 MET min/week), or above (>\u20091200 MET min/week) the range of the minimal WHO recommendations impact the age- and sex-dependent prevalence of these risk factors remains to be elucidated.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate these relationships using population-based self-reported data collected in a central European country (Austria, 2019). The sample included a total of 15,461 persons (7166 males: 16-95\u2009+\u2009years, BMI 26.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4; 8295 females: 16-95\u2009+\u2009years, BMI 25.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0). Besides various lifestyle factors (e.g., dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption), variables of particular interest were the age- and sex-dependent amount of weekly PA and prevalence of risk factors for CVD. Sex-specific logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between self-reported PA and risk factor prevalence.\nRESULTS: Relatively small beneficial effects were found regarding the prevalence of risk factors for CVD when achieving PA levels corresponding to 600-1200 MET min/week as compared to those who did not meet these recommendations. However, exceeding the WHO recommendations provided much more pronounced benefits, especially in younger and older age groups. Adjusted ORs revealed that high volumes of PA (>\u20091200 MET min/week) were associated with a 32-43% reduction in the prevalence of obesity and T2D compared to those who did not achieve the WHO recommendations (<\u2009600 MET min/week), as well as with a lower prevalence of systemic hypertension only in women and a lower prevalence of hypercholesterolemia only in men.\nCONCLUSIONS: Exceeding minimal WHO recommendations for PA promises large beneficial effects, particularly on the prevalence of obesity and T2D. Demonstrated sex differences in PA levels and their association with cardiovascular risk factors may provide an important basis for preventive health counseling."

Regular participation in physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior play important roles in maintaining physical health and disease prevention.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of programed walking exercise using a wearable hip exoskeleton, Bot Fit on muscle strength, muscle effort, and the kinematics of the pelvis in younger adults.\nMETHODS: We designed three parallel experimental conditions and randomly assigned participants to one of three groups: those assigned to exercise using an interval program of Bot Fit (interval group), those who used a power program of Bot Fit (power group), and a control group who exercised without Bot Fit. A total of 45 young adults participated in 18 exercise-intervention sessions over six weeks, and all participants were assessed at two time points: before and after the 18 exercise sessions. Each assessment evaluated muscle strength, muscle effort, and the kinematics of the pelvis during walking. In addition, the number of steps, distance, energy expenditure, and heart rate for 30\u00a0min during the exercise sessions were recorded.\nRESULTS: A significant increase in the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the left biceps femoris (BF) was evident in the interval group, while significant changes in the MVC of the bilateral BF were seen in the power group after Bot Fit exercise. A significant decrease of muscle effort in the right BF in the interval group and right lumbar erector spinae and bilateral BF in the power group were also observed. In addition, the symmetry index of pelvic tilt significantly improved in the interval group, and greater exercise volume and intensity in both the interval and power groups compared with the control group were confirmed as measured by the number of steps, distance, energy expenditure, and heart rate.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirmed the beneficial effect of programed walking exercise using the Bot Fit on muscle strength of trunk and lower extremities, muscle effort, and pelvic movement symmetry in younger adults.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are generally restricted regarding participation in competitive sports based on the potential risk of sudden cardiac death and malignant arrhythmias. As a result, they are often inactive and experience the negative consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. Hence, the need arises to strike the right balance between these 2 extremes through personalized exercise prescription. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the characteristics of patients with HCM practicing regular aerobic physical activity compared with sedentary patients; (2) to perform a personalized moderate-intensity exercise prescription and evaluate its effects.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HCM were evaluated through clinical assessment, ECG, ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary testing. A personalized moderate-intensity exercise prescription was performed, and the same investigations were repeated. Physically active patients with HCM demonstrated better cardiopulmonary functional capacity than sedentary patients (oxygen consumption<sub>peak</sub>/kg 32.9\u00b17.4 versus 25.2\u00b17.4\u2009mL/min per kg P\u22640.0001, ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope 26.7\u00b14.3 versus 29.9\u00b15.2 P=0.004), with similar prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias (P=0.43). Sedentary subjects showed a borderline higher prevalence of obesity (P=0.07) than physically active subjects. Moderate-intensity exercise prescription led to improved cardiopulmonary fitness without occurrence of adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with HCM practicing regular aerobic exercise have a better functional capacity in the absence of relevant events than sedentary patients. Conversely, a sedentary lifestyle led to a deterioration of cardiopulmonary functional capacity and fitness. The tailored moderate-intensity personalized exercise prescription appears to be a feasible approach in carefully selected patients with HCM to counterbalance the negative effects of sedentary behavior without significant major events."

            "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a severe and recurring condition that has become a significant public health issue globally. Studies indicate a heightened risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular diseases among individuals with bipolar disorder, potentially increasing mortality rates. The chronic nature of bipolar disorder leads to disturbances across multiple systems, including autonomic dysfunction, over-activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased levels of peripheral inflammatory markers. These disruptions cause endothelial damage, the formation of plaques and blood clots, in addition to the medications used to treat bipolar disorder and genetic associations contributing to cardiovascular disease development. Understanding the complex interplay between bipolar disorder and cardiovascular events is essential for the prevention and effective management of cardiovascular conditions in individuals with bipolar disorder."

            "title": "The Effectiveness of Exercise in Reducing Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
            "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the major causes of sickness and death in the world. However, lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, can significantly reduce the risk of this disease. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of various forms of physical activity in reducing CVD risk factors among adults. A comprehensive search of the databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) databases was conducted between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2024, as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and observational studies on the impact of aerobic, resistance, or combined training on cardiovascular risk factors in adults (\u226518 years) were considered for inclusion. Data relating to primary outcomes, including stroke and myocardial infarction rates, BP, cholesterol levels, and BMI\u00a0were collected. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist were used for quality and bias assessment. Meta-analyses were performed using the RevMan software, with heterogeneity evaluated by I\u00b2 statistics; 17 studies, including 11 RCTs and six cohort studies, met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in the mean systolic BP (SBP) by 3.32 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-5.78 mmHg; p<0.0001] and mean diastolic BP (DBP) by 2.99 mmHg (95% CI: 2.34-3.64 mmHg; p\u200a<\u200a0.00001) after exercise interventions. Moreover, cholesterol levels and BMI values improved with exercise. Those who exercised had a lower risk of stroke or heart attack compared with the controls [odds ratio (OR): 0.57; 95% CI: 0.28-1.14; p\u200a>0.0001], although there was substantial heterogeneity in effect size across the studies (I\u00b2\u200a=\u200a98%). Different types of physical activity (i.e., aerobic, resistance, or combined exercise) can effectively reduce key cardiovascular risk factors, including BP, cholesterol levels, and BMI values. Regular physical activity is still regarded as the most effective preventive measure against CVD, despite inconsistencies in research findings. Future studies should aim to identify optimal exercise programs and their long-term effects on diverse populations."

Although physical activity commonly follows a \"weekend warrior\" pattern, in which most moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is concentrated in 1 or 2 days rather than spread more evenly across the week (regular), the effects of physical activity pattern across a range of incident diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions, are unknown.\nMETHODS: We tested associations between physical activity pattern and incidence of 678 conditions in 89\u2009573 participants (62\u00b18 years of age; 56% women) of the UK Biobank prospective cohort study who wore an accelerometer for 1 week between June 2013 and December 2015. Models were adjusted for multiple baseline clinical factors, and P value thresholds were corrected for multiplicity.\nRESULTS: When compared to inactive (&lt;150 minutes moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week), both weekend warrior (267 total associations; 264 [99%] with lower disease risk; hazard ratio [HR] range, 0.35-0.89) and regular activity (209 associations; 205 [98%] with lower disease risk; HR range, 0.41-0.88) were broadly associated with lower risk of incident disease. The strongest associations were observed for cardiometabolic conditions such as incident hypertension (weekend warrior: HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.80]; P=1.2\u00d710-27; regular: HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68-0.77]; P=4.5\u00d710-28), diabetes (weekend warrior: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.62]; P=3.9\u00d710-32; regular: HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.48-0.60]; P=8.7\u00d710-26), obesity (weekend warrior: HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.50-0.60]; P=2.4\u00d710-43, regular: HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.40-0.50]; P=9.6\u00d710-47), and sleep apnea (weekend warrior: HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.48-0.69]; P=1.6\u00d710-9; regular: HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.39-0.62]; P=7.4\u00d710-10). When weekend warrior and regular activity were compared directly, there were no conditions for which effects differed significantly. Observations were similar when activity was thresholded at the sample median (\u2265230.4 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week).\nCONCLUSIONS: Achievement of measured physical activity volumes consistent with guideline recommendations is associated with lower risk for >200 diseases, with prominent effects on cardiometabolic conditions. Associations appear similar whether physical activity follows a weekend warrior pattern or is spread more evenly throughout the week."

            "abstract": "Modern cancer therapies greatly improve clinical outcomes for both early and advanced breast cancer patients. However, these advances have raised concerns about potential short- and long-term toxicities, including cardiovascular toxicities. Therefore, understanding the common risk factors and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular toxicity is essential to ensure best breast cancer outcomes. While cardio-oncology has emerged as a sub-speciality to address these challenges, it is essential that all cardiologists recognize and understand the cardiovascular consequences of cancer therapy. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential adverse cardiovascular effects associated with modern breast cancer therapies. A preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic workflow to minimize the impact of cardiovascular toxicity on patient outcomes is presented. Key aspects of this workflow include regular monitoring of cardiovascular function, early detection and management of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicities, and optimization of cardiovascular risk factor control. By highlighting the gaps in knowledge in some areas, this review aims to emphasize the critical role of cardio-oncology research in ensuring the holistic well-being of patients with breast cancer."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality, with statins widely used to reduce its risk. Despite extensive research, the nuanced impact of statin therapy on cardiorespiratory fitness, particularly the reduction in peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), is still an open question. This study aims to contribute fresh insights to the ongoing discussion, highlighting the unresolved nature of this clinical matter.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise\u00a0test (CPET) in male and female participants over 18\u00a0years of age who were under statins treatment. They were categorized as physically active or inactive according to self-report of physical activity. From 33,804 CPET, 4,941 participants (76\u00a0% men, age 42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years; and 24\u00a0% women, age 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years) were included in the study.\nRESULTS: The multivariate linear regression model showed that statins were associated with a significant reduction in VO<sub>2</sub> peak (-4.2 [-4.8, -3.5] mL/kg/min, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01) after adjusting for age, sex, use of beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, presence of diabetes, and weekly level of physical activity. This reduction in VO<sub>2</sub> peak was attenuated in participants with higher weekly physical activity volume (150 to 300\u00a0min/week: 3.2 [2.7; 3.7] mL/kg/min; 301 to 600\u00a0min/week: 4.5 [3.7; 5.3] mL/kg/min; and\u00a0&gt;\u00a0600\u00a0min/week: 6.9 [5.4; 8.4] mL/kg/min, all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with a lower VO<sub>2</sub> peak in adults. However, this adverse effect appears to be mitigated by engaging in regular physical activity (&gt;150\u00a0min/week). Future research should explore the mechanisms behind this interaction and identify optimal exercise regimens for individuals on statin therapy."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are a group of interrelated conditions, including heart failure and diabetes, that increase the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications. The rising number of Australians with CMDs has necessitated new strategies for those managing these conditions, such as digital health interventions. The effectiveness of digital health interventions in supporting people with CMDs is dependent on the extent to which users engage with the tools. Augmenting digital health interventions with conversational agents, technologies that interact with people using natural language, may enhance engagement because of their human-like attributes. To date, no systematic review has compiled evidence on how design features influence the engagement of conversational agent-enabled interventions supporting people with CMDs. This review seeks to address this gap, thereby guiding developers in creating more engaging and effective tools for CMD management.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence pertaining to conversational agent-enabled intervention design features and their impacts on the engagement of people managing CMD.\nMETHODS: The review is conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Searches will be conducted in the Ovid (Medline), Web of Science, and Scopus databases, which will be run again prior to manuscript submission. Inclusion criteria will consist of primary research studies reporting on conversational agent-enabled interventions, including measures of engagement, in adults with CMD. Data extraction will seek to capture the perspectives of people with CMD on the use of conversational agent-enabled interventions. Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools will be used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence collected.\nRESULTS: This review was initiated in May 2023 and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in June 2023, prior to title and abstract screening. Full-text screening of articles was completed in July 2023 and data extraction began August 2023. Final searches were conducted in April 2024 prior to finalizing the review and the manuscript was submitted for peer review in July 2024.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review will synthesize diverse observations pertaining to conversational agent-enabled intervention design features and their impacts on engagement among people with CMDs. These observations can be used to guide the development of more engaging conversational agent-enabled interventions, thereby increasing the likelihood of regular intervention use and improved CMD health outcomes. Additionally, this review will identify gaps in the literature in terms of how engagement is reported, thereby highlighting areas for future exploration and supporting researchers in advancing the understanding of conversational agent-enabled interventions.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42023431579; https://tinyurl.com/55cxkm26.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/52973."

The EDITA-ON study aimed to assess long-term effects of open label therapy with ambrisentan vs. no pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.\nMETHODS: Patients who participated in the EDITA study and received regular follow-up were included in EDITA-ON. Clinical, echocardiographic, laboratory, exercise and hemodynamic parameters during follow-up were analysed. The primary endpoint was to assess whether continued treatment with ambrisentan vs. no treatment prevented the development of PAH according to the new definition.\nRESULTS: Of 38 SSc patients included in the EDITA study four were lost to follow-up. Of the 34 remaining patients (age 55\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years, 82.1% female subjects), 19 received ambrisentan after termination of the blinded phase, 15 received no PAH medication. The mean follow-up time was 2.59\u2009\u00b1\u20091.47 years, during which 29 patients underwent right heart catheterization. There was a significant improvement of mPAP in catheterised patients receiving ambrisentan vs. no PAH treatment (-1.53\u2009\u00b1\u20092.53 vs. 1.91\u2009\u00b1\u20092.98 mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.003). In patients without PAH treatment 6/12 patients had PAH vs. 1/17 of patients receiving ambrisentan (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nCONCLUSION: In SSc patients with early PVD, the development of PAH and/or deterioration was less frequent among patients receiving ambrisentan, indicating that early treatment and close follow-up could be beneficial in this high-risk group. Future trials in this field are needed to confirm these results."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation constitutes the most effective therapeutic option for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease but remains burdened by a high incidence of cardiovascular disease. To date, exercise is an important preventive strategy that has been underestimated; in kidney transplant patients, exercise programs lead to an improvement in cardiorespiratory performance, muscle strength, arterial stiffness, and patients' quality of life perception.\nSUMMARY: The nephrology and transplant community have moved from generic suggestions to specific indications regarding frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression of physical exercise both in the pre- and posttransplant phase. The latest guidelines from the World Health Organization for patients with chronic conditions propose a combination of aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and multicomponent exercises (e.g., balance) to improve health. Based on recent evidence, a combined exercise program (aerobic and strength exercise) is largely proposed to kidney transplant recipients. Aerobic exercise should be performed at an intensity &gt;60% of theoretical maximum heart rate or maximum oxygen uptake possibly every day, and strength training should be performed at a &gt;60% the estimate single maximum repetition, at least 2 times per week.\nKEY MESSAGES: Physical exercise should be personalized in relation to the patient's baseline performance; increases must be progressive and gradual. Regular physical activity should also be recommended to patients awaiting for a transplant. Eventually, organizational models based on a network of nephrology units, transplant centers, sports medicine centers, and fitness center or outdoor gym are essential elements for overcoming the logistical barriers for prescribing and carrying out regular physical activity."

            "abstract": "The consumption of almonds has been associated with several health benefits, particularly concerning cardiovascular and intestinal health. In this comprehensive review, we compile and deliberate studies investigating the effects of almond consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and gut health. Almonds are rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and polyphenols, which contribute to their health-promoting properties. Regular intake of almonds has been shown to improve lipid profiles by reducing LDL cholesterol and enhancing HDL functionality. Additionally, almonds aid in glycemic control, blood pressure reduction, and chronic inflammation amelioration, which are critical for cardiovascular health. The antioxidant properties of almonds, primarily due to their high vitamin E content, help in reducing oxidative stress markers. Furthermore, almonds positively influence body composition by reducing body fat percentage and central adiposity and enhancing satiety, thus aiding in weight management. Herein, we also contemplate the emerging concept of the gut-heart axis, where almond consumption appears to modulate the gut microbiome, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and increasing short-chain fatty acid production, particularly butyrate. These effects collectively contribute to the anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective benefits of almonds. By encompassing these diverse aspects, we eventually provide a systematic and updated perspective on the multifaceted benefits of almond consumption for cardiovascular health and gut microbiome, corroborating their broader consideration in dietary guidelines and public health recommendations for CVD risk reduction."

Conversely, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining optimal fitness levels, adhering to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, effectively managing body weight, ensuring adequate sleep, implementing stress-reduction strategies, and addressing psychosocial risk factors are associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence from large observational studies and randomized controlled trials on lifestyle factors as determinants of ASCVD health. It also briefly reviews mechanistic insights into how factors such as low shear stress, increased reactive oxygen species production, chronic inflammation, platelets and coagulation activation, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic hyperactivity contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of ASCVD risk factors. These include obesity, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, subsequently leading to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, ultimately resulting in chronic ASCVD or acute cardiovascular events. To bridge the translational gap between epidemiologic and trial-based evidence and clinical practice, practical recommendations are summarized to facilitate the translation of scientific knowledge into actionable interventions to promote ASCVD health. Acknowledged is the gap between the evidence-based knowledge and adoption within healthcare systems, which remains a crucial objective in advancing cardiovascular health at the population level."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental health problems contribute significantly to the overall disease burden worldwide and are major causes of disability, suicide, and ischaemic heart disease. People with bipolar disorder report lower levels of physical activity than the general population, and are at greater risk of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease and obesity. These contribute to poor health outcomes. Physical activity has the potential to improve quality of life and physical and mental well-being.\nOBJECTIVES: To identify the factors that influence participation in physical activity for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder from the perspectives of service users, carers, service providers, and practitioners to help inform the design and implementation of interventions that promote physical activity.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and eight other databases to March 2021. We also contacted experts in the field, searched the grey literature, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. There were no language restrictions.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that focused on the experiences and attitudes of service users, carers, service providers, and healthcare professionals towards physical activity for bipolar disorder.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined questions. We used the \"best fit\" framework synthesis based on a revised version of the Health Belief Model to analyse and present the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using the CASP Qualitative Checklist. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) guidance to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each finding to identify factors to inform the practice of health and care professionals and the design and development of physical activity interventions for people with bipolar disorder.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 participants in qualitative research studies). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity of people with experience of bipolar disorder. A number of studies also reported on personal experiences of physical activity components of lifestyle interventions. One study included views from family carers and clinicians. The majority of studies were from high-income countries, with only one study conducted in a middle-income country. Most participants were described as stable and had been living with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for a number of years. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate or low confidence, as some findings were based on only small amounts of data, and the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, questioning the relevance of these findings to other settings. We also had very few perspectives of family members, other carers, or health professionals supporting people with bipolar disorder. The studies did not include any findings from service providers about their perspectives on supporting this aspect of care. There were a number of factors that limited people's ability to undertake physical activity. Shame and stigma about one's physical appearance and mental health diagnosis were discussed. Some people felt their sporting skills/competencies had been lost when they left school. Those who had been able to maintain exercise through the transition into adulthood appeared to be more likely to include physical activity in their regular routine. Physical health limits and comorbid health conditions limited activity. This included bipolar medication, being overweight, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet and sleep, and these barriers were linked to negative coping skills. Practical problems included affordability, accessibility, transport links, and the weather. Workplace or health schemes that offered discounts were viewed positively. The lack of opportunity for exercise within inpatient mental health settings was a problem. Facilitating factors included being psychologically stable and ready to adopt new lifestyle behaviours. There were positive benefits of being active outdoors and connecting with nature. Achieving balance, rhythm, and routine helped to support mood management. Fitting physical activity into a regular routine despite fluctuating mood or motivation appeared to be beneficial if practised at the right intensity and pace. Over- or under-exercising could be counterproductive and accelerate depressive or manic moods. Physical activity also helped to provide a structure to people's daily routines and could lead to other positive lifestyle benefits. Monitoring physical or other activities could be an effective way to identify potential triggers or early warning signs. Technology was helpful for some. People who had researched bipolar disorder and had developed a better understanding of the condition showed greater confidence in managing their care or providing care to others. Social support from friends/family or health professionals was an enabling factor, as was finding the right type of exercise, which for many people was walking. Other benefits included making social connections, weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Few people had been told of the benefits of physical activity. Better education and training of health professionals could support a more holistic approach to physical and mental well-being. Involving mental health professionals in the multidisciplinary delivery of physical activity interventions could be beneficial and improve care. Clear guidelines could help people to initiate and incorporate lifestyle changes.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very little research focusing on factors that influence participation in physical activity in bipolar disorder. The studies we identified suggest that men and women with bipolar disorder face a range of obstacles and challenges to being active. The evidence also suggests that there are effective ways to promote managed physical activity. The research highlighted the important role that health and care settings, and professionals, can play in assessing individuals' physical health needs and how healthy lifestyles may be promoted. Based on these findings, we have provided a summary of key elements to consider for developing physical activity interventions for bipolar disorder."

However, the associations between pCAD and markers of cardiometabolic health in healthy adults are not known, nor are the effects of regular exercise on pCAD.\nMETHODS: A total of 641 physically inactive adults free of cardiovascular disease from the HERITAGE Family Study completed 20 weeks of exercise training. The pCAD index (range 0-100) was calculated using measurements of apolipoproteins A-I, C-I, C-II, C-III, and C-IV from ApoA-I-tagged serum (higher index\u00a0=\u00a0higher CAD risk). The associations between pCAD index and cardiometabolic traits at baseline and their training responses were assessed with Spearman correlation and general linear models. A Bonferroni correction of p\u00a0&lt;\u00a08.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-04 was used to determine statistical significance.\nRESULTS: The mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD baseline pCAD index was 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032, with 106 (16.5\u00a0%) participants classified as high CAD risk. At baseline, pCAD index was positively associated with blood pressure, systemic inflammation, and body composition. HDL size, VO<sub>2</sub>max, and HDL-C were negatively associated with pCAD index at baseline. Of those classified as high CAD risk at baseline, 52 (49\u00a0%) were reclassified as normal risk after training. Following training, pCAD index changes were inversely correlated (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a01.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-04) with changes in HDL-C, HDL size, and LDL size.\nCONCLUSIONS: A higher pCAD index was associated with a worse cardiometabolic profile at baseline but improved with regular exercise. The results from this study highlight the potential role of HDL apolipoproteins as therapeutic targets for lifestyle interventions, particularly in high-risk individuals."

However, key components of these interventions that reduce cardiovascular risk factors are not yet distinguished. This study aims to identify features of telehealth-delivered CR that improve secondary prevention outcomes, exercise capacity, participation, and participant satisfaction and develop recommendations for future telehealth-delivered CR. The protocol for our review was registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (#CRD42021236471). We systematically searched four databases (PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database) for randomized controlled trials comparing telehealth-delivered CR programmes to facility-based interventions or usual care. Two independent reviewers screened the abstracts and then full texts. Using a qualitative review methodology (realist synthesis), included articles were evaluated to determine contextual factors and potential mechanisms that impacted cardiovascular risk factors, exercise capacity, participation in the intervention, and increased satisfaction. We included 37 reports describing 26 randomized controlled trials published from 2010 to 2022. Studies were primarily conducted in Europe and Australia/Asia. Identified contextual factors and mechanisms were synthesized into four theories required to enhance participant outcomes and participation. These theories are as follows: (i) early and regular engagement; (ii) personalized interventions and shared goals; (iii) usable, accessible, and supported interventions; and (iv) exercise that is measured and monitored. Providing a personalized approach with frequent opportunities for bi-directional interaction was a critical feature for success across telehealth-delivered CR trials. Real-world effectiveness studies are now needed to complement our findings."

            "abstract": "Evidence for a key role of dysregulated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in maladaptive stress response/recovery and non-communicable disease development is extensive. Monitoring ANS activity via regular heart rate variability (HRV) measurement is growing in popularity in adult populations given that low HRV has been associated with ANS dysregulation, poor stress response/reactivity, increased cardiometabolic disease risk and early mortality. Although cardiometabolic disease may originate in early life, regular HRV measurement for assessing ANS activity in childhood populations, especially those consisting of children < 6 years of age, remains largely unpractised. A greater understanding of ANS activity modifiers in early life may improve analysis and interpretation of HRV measurements, thereby optimising its usefulness. Taking into consideration that HRV and ANS activity can be improved via daily engagement in physical activity (PA), this review will discuss the ANS and HRV, ANS activity modifiers, cardiometabolic disease risk factors and PA as they relate to childhood/adolescent populations (\u2264 18 years old)."

            "abstract": "Evidence from the existing literature suggests that exercise has positive effects for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases by reducing risk factors such as elevated blood lipids. Based on clinical and observational clinical trials, it is well established that increased physical activity and regular exercise has a favourable impact on blood lipids and lipoprotein profiles. Exercise training significantly decreases blood triglycerides concentration and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Though the Indian data depicting the effect of exercise on lipids is scarce, exercise directly improves \"atherogenic dyslipidaemia\" which is frequently present among Indians i.e. HDL-C is increased, TG is reduced and LDL-C particle size is improved. While drug therapy is key to the treatment of dyslipidaemia, lifestyle alterations such as exercise should continue to be actively promoted and encouraged by clinicians. Exercise is a low cost, non pharmacological therapeutic lifestyle change that is of value to lipid metabolism and cardiovascular fitness."

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality is high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most patients reveal a high prevalence of CV risk factors such as diabetes or arterial hypertension and many have manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure with an increased risk of clinical events including sudden cardiac death. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension contribute to the development of CKD and the prevalence of CKD is in the range of 20-65% in diabetic and 30-50% in hypertensive patients. Therefore, prevention and optimal treatment of CV risk factors and comorbidities are key strategies to reduce CV risk and improve survival in CKD. Beyond common CV risk factors, patients with CKD are often physically inactive and have low physical function leading to subsequent frailty with muscle fatigue and weakness, sarcopenia and increased risk of falling. Consequently, the economic health burden of CKD is high, requiring feasible strategies to counteract this vicious cycle. Regular physical activity and exercise training (ET) have been shown to be effective in improving risk factors, reducing CVD and reducing frailty and falls. Nonetheless, combining ET and a healthy lifestyle with pharmacological treatment is not frequently applied in clinical practice. For that reason, this Clinical Consensus Statement reviews the current literature and provides evidence-based data regarding the role of ET in reducing CV and overall burden in patients with CKD. The aim is to increase awareness among cardiologists, nephrologists, and healthcare professionals of the potential of exercise therapy in order to encourage implementation of ET in clinical practice, eventually reducing CV risk and disease, as well as reducing frailty in patients with CKD G3-G5D."

We investigated the association between depression and clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), adjusted for PRO.\nMETHODS: Using prospective data from Hong Kong Diabetes Register (2013-2019), we estimated the hazard-ratio (HR, 95%CI) of depression (validated Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score\u22657) with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD: eGFR&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2) and all-cause mortality in 4525 Chinese patients with T2D adjusted for patient characteristics, renal function, medications, self-care and HRQoL domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression measured by EQ-5D-3L) in linear-regression models.\nRESULTS: In this cohort without prior events [mean \u00b1 SD age:55.7 \u00b1 10.6, 43.7% women, median (IQR) disease duration of 7.0 (2.0-13.0) years, HbA1c, 7.2% (6.6%-8.20%), 26.4% insulin-treated], 537(11.9%) patients had depressive symptoms and 1923 (42.5%) patients had some problems with HRQoL at baseline. After 5.6(IQR: 4.4-6.2) years, 141 patients (3.1%) died, 533(11.8%) developed CKD and 164(3.6%) developed CVD. In a fully-adjusted model (model 4) including self-care and HRQoL, the aHR of depression was 1.99 (95% confidence interval CI):1.25-3.18) for CVD, 2.29 (1.25-4.21) for IHD. Depression was associated with all-cause mortality in models 1-3 adjusted for demographics, clinical characteristics and self-care, but was attenuated after adjusting for HRQoL (model 4- 1.54; 95%CI: 0.91-2.60), though HR still indicated same direction with important magnitude. Patients who reported having regular exercise (3-4 times per week) had reduced aHR of CKD [0.61 (0.41-0.89)]. Item 4 of PHQ-9 (feeling tired, little energy) was independently associated with all-cause mortality with aHR of 1.66 (1.30-2.12).\nCONCLUSION: Depression exhibits significant association with CVD, IHD, and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes, adjusting for their HRQoL and health behaviors. Despite the association between depression and all-cause mortality attenuated after adjusting for HRQoL, the effect size remains substantial. The feeling of tiredness or having little energy, as assessed by item Q4 of the PHQ-9 questionnaire, was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after covariate adjustments. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating psychiatric evaluations into holistic diabetes management."

Cycling, an aerobic exercise, is believed to have a more effective rehabilitative impact on patients with heart failure. Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of exercise in patients with HF. However, a precise causal relationship remains unknown. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the potential causal relationship between regular cardiac cycling and heart failure (HF) development. Data from the IEU OpenGWAS project, an extensive genetic study involving a diverse group of European males and females was used to determine how choices related to physical activity, such as cycling, impact cardiovascular well-being. To ensure reliability and robustness, the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and random effects with inverse variance weighting methods were used. The key findings were summarized using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The MR-Egger, weighted mean, and inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimated superiority ratios were 0.960 (95% CI: 0.909-1.013), 0.985 (95% CI: 0.962-1.009), and 0.982 (95% CI: 0.966-0.998), respectively, indicating a significant association between cycling and a decreased risk of heart failure. These findings suggest that cycling, a form of moderate and easily accessible physical activity, may be a protective factor against HF. These findings correlate with those of previous studies regarding the crucial role of regular physical activity for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease. The outcomes of this MR analysis can be used in the development of public health policies and aid individuals making lifestyle choices that promote heart health."

The aim of this study was to assess whether Mediterranean diet and physical activity are also cost-effective in patients with established CVD.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was performed comparing a combined Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention to usual care in patients with CVD. The CUA had a healthcare perspective and lifetime horizon. Costs and utilities were estimated using a microsimulation on a cohort of 100 000 patients with CVD sampled from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease study (n = 8947, mean age 62 \u00b1 8.7 years, and 74% male). Cost-effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net health benefit (INHB), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). Mediterranean diet and physical activity yielded 2.0 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost reductions of \u20ac1236 per person compared with usual care, resulting in an ICER of \u20ac-626/QALY [95% confidence interval (CI) -1929 to 2673]. At a willingness-to-pay of \u20ac20 000/QALY, INHB was 2.04 (95% CI 0.99-3.58) QALYs and INMB was \u20ac40 757 (95% CI 19 819-71 605). The interventions remained cost-effective in a wide range of sensitivity analyses, including worst-case scenarios and scenarios with reimbursement for food and physical activity costs.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with established CVD, a combined Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention was cost-saving and highly cost-effective compared with usual care. These findings strongly advocate for the incorporation of lifestyle interventions as integral components of care for all patients with CVD."

This study aims to investigate the overall epidemiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among nurses.\nMETHOD: We searched all four main databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Embase and Web of Sciences from the beginning of 2000 to March 2022 with appropriate Mesh Terms. We also searched Google scholar. Then we applied inclusion and exclusion criteria and after selection the studies the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. Comprehensive Meta-analysis and R software was used for analysis.\nRESULTS: Finally, 22 articles with a total number of 117922 nurses were included. Among all risk factors, sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular physical activity with a prevalence of 46.3% (CI 95%, 26.6-67.2) was regarded as the main prevalent risk factor among nurses. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured in the study population was 121.31 (CI 95%, 114.73-127.90) and the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 78.08 (CI 95%, 74.90-81.25).

Furthermore, among nurses with shift works almost all risk factors got higher score representing the worse condition in comparison with day workers' nurses. This study enables learning the associated risk factors of CVD among nurses to facilitate interventional programs with a view to reduce the exposure of nursing staff particularly those who work in shifts to cardiovascular risk factors.\n1. WHAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN?: In general, many studies have emphasized the impact of the nursing profession on the incidence of some cardiovascular patients. Also, different shifts of nurses can have a double effect.\n2. WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS?: In this study, the mean for sedentary lifestyle was reported to be 46.3% which represented the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular risk factors among study population.\n3. WHAT IS THEIR SIGNIFICANCE?: This study enables learning the associated risk factors of CVD among nurses to facilitate interventional programs with a view to reduce the exposure of nursing staff particularly those who work in shifts to cardiovascular risk factors.

            "abstract": "Background: An intricate physiological and pathophysiological connection exists between the heart and lungs, which is especially important in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). While an exercise intervention may seem the best approach to leverage this relationship, the prior work has shown that, despite numerous health benefits, regular exercise training does not improve cardiorespiratory control in individuals with SCI. Breath training presents an alternative intervention that is uniquely accessible, with yogic breathing directly engaging linked fluctuations in respiration and cardiovascular control. In addition, there is evidence across a range of populations that regular yogic breathing reduces cardiovascular disease risk. It is possible that the chronic decrease in breathing frequency associated with regular yogic breathing, rather than the specific yogic breathing techniques themselves, is the primary contributor to the observed risk reduction. Methods: Therefore, in 12 individuals with traumatic SCI from C4 to T8, the authors compared Unpaced and conventional 0.083\u2009Hz (Slow) paced breathing with various yogic breathing techniques including: (1) inspiratory-expiratory breath holds (i.e., Kumbhaka or \"Box Breathing\"), (2) extended exhalation (1:2 duty cycle), and (3) expiratory resistance via throat constriction (i.e., Ujjayi). Beat-to-beat heart rate and blood pressure were measured as well as end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> saturation were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc pairwise t tests corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: As expected, all slow breathing patterns markedly increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) compared with Unpaced in all (n\u2009=\u200912) individuals. More importantly, Ujjayi breathing appeared to improve ventilatory efficiency over Unpaced breathing in individuals with SCI by increasing O<sub>2</sub> saturation (97.6% vs. 96.1%; p\u2009=\u20090.042) and tended to decrease end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (32\u2009mmHg vs. 35\u2009mmHg; p\u2009=\u20090.08). While other slow breathing patterns demonstrated similar effects, only Ujjayi improved RSA while increasing heart rate and improving ventilatory efficiency. Conclusions: Hence, slow breathing per se can result in important cardiorespiratory changes, but the yogic breathing practice of Ujjayi, with glottic throat resistance, may hold the greatest promise for improving cardiorespiratory control in individuals with SCI (CTR ID No. NCT05480618)."

All patients were stable for more than 48\u2005h and less than 1 week after revascularization for acute coronary syndrome and were randomly assigned to Group A (home-based rehabilitation group) or Group B (center guided home-based rehabilitation group). The cardiopulmonary exercise test was mainly performed before and 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation (at the end of intervention). The primary endpoints of the study were peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), and the secondary endpoints were maximum metabolic equivalents (METs), anaerobic threshold exercise load (Load AT), maximal workload (Load max), and anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake (VO2 AT).\nRESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included in the study, with 47 patients in Group A (with 6 losses) and 50 patients in Group B (with 3 losses). There were no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C),cardiovascular risk factors. In Group A, no significant differences in CPET indices were observed before and after the intervention. In Group B, values of maximum metabolic equivalents (METs), peak heart rate (PHR), anaerobic threshold exercise load (Load AT), maximal workload (Load max), maximum ventilation per minute (VE max), peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake (VO2 AT) and maximum oxygen pulse (VO2/HRmax) were higher than those before the intervention (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

EAT has emerged as a distinctive reservoir of visceral fat, intricately interlinked with cardiovascular health, particularly within the domain of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The aim of our overview is to highlight the role of EAT as a marker for cardiovascular risk in children. We also explore the influence of unhealthy lifestyle habits as predisposing factors for the deposition of EAT. The literature data accentuate the consequential impact of lifestyle choices on EAT dynamics, with sedentary behavior and unwholesome dietary practices being contributory to a heightened cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle interventions with a multidisciplinary approach are therefore pivotal, involving a nutritionally balanced diet rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, regular engagement in aerobic exercise, and psychosocial support to effectively mitigate cardiovascular risks in children. Specific interventions, such as high-intensity intermittent training and circuit training, reveal favorable outcomes in diminishing the EAT volume and enhancing cardiometabolic health. Future clinical studies focusing on EAT in children are crucial for advancing our understanding and developing targeted strategies for cardiovascular risk management in this population."

Obesity is a disease of positive energy balance resulting from complex interactions between abnormal neurohumoral responses and an individual's socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic factors leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Understanding the complex nature of the disease is crucial in determining the best approach to combat its rising numbers. Despite recent advancements in pharmacological therapy for the treatment of obesity, reversing weight gain and maintaining weight loss is challenging due to the relapsing nature of the disease. Prevention, therefore, remains the key which needs to start in utero and continued throughout life. This review summarizes the role obesity plays in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases both by directly affecting endothelial and myocyte function and indirectly by enhancing major cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. We highlight the importance of a holistic approach needed to prevent and treat this debilitating disease. Particularly, we analyse the effects of plant-based diet, regular exercise, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis on obesity and overall cardiorespiratory fitness.

Although regular intensive physical exercise is thought to be a key to a healthy life, unsuspected pathologies might lead to SCD during or after physical activity. Cardiac dysfunction and elevated cardiac markers have been reported after prolonged exercise. We sought to clarify the cardiac marker levels and hydration status in healthy, middle-aged male subjects for 24 hours after running sixty-minute at race-pace. The participants were 47.4\u00b11.7 years old, had peak oxygen consumption of 47.1\u00b11.2ml/kg/min, and regularly running 70.5\u00b16.4km/week. Blood biomarkers were performed before, immediately after, at the fourth and twenty-fourth hours after running. Compared to initial values, creatine kinase (before:161.2\u00b122.5U/L, 24 hours after:411.9\u00b1139.7U/L, p<0.001) and CK-MB (before:4.3\u00b10.7ng/ml, 24 hours after:10.1\u00b13.0ng/ml, p<0.001) were significantly elevated immediately after running and remained significantly high for 24 hours. In addition, Troponin-I (before:5.0\u00b11.1ng/l, 4 hours after:81.5\u00b129.9ng/l, p<0.001) and NT-proBNP (before: 31.2\u00b15.3pg/ml, immediately after: 64.4\u00b18.5pg/ml, p<0.01) were significantly elevated immediately after running and returned to baseline levels in 24 hours. The sixty-minute running caused significant dehydration, but athletes were rehydrated at the 4th hour in their voluntary hydration behavior. As the individual data were analyzed, it was interesting to see that some of the athletes had critical biomarker levels without any cardiac symptom. Our findings indicate that race-pace sixty-minute running may induce a possible transient silent myocardial injury in apparently healthy master runners.

We established FY2018 as our baseline year. The subjects of this study were adults aged 40-74 in FY2018(baseline) who had type 2 diabetes and underwent specific health checkups in FY2020. We excluded adults with a medical record of kidney dialysis between FY2017 and FY2018, records of suspected type 1 diabetes between FY2017 and FY2020, or a baseline eGFR >85 mL/min/1.73 m2 or missing eGFR data as of FY2020. Eventually we analyzed 573,860 individuals. The outcome variable was a rapid decline in eGFR (\u226530%) during the follow-up. Exposure lifestyle factors included skipping breakfast, late-night dinners, regular smoking, a high alcohol intake, non-refreshing sleep, and a lack of habitual exercise. Logistic regression models were stratified by age (40-59 and 60-74 years) and baseline eGFR levels (60-85, 30-59, and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Covariates included sex, a history of heart disease, a history of stroke, a history of renal failure, anemia, low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, body mass index, antidiabetic medications, antihypertension drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, the oral adsorbent Kremezin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and drugs for the treatment of renal anemia. A rapid decline in eGFR was detected in approximately 1.3% of participants (7,683 cases). In the baseline eGFR >30 subgroups (60-85 or 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), skipping breakfast and regular smoking were associated with a rapid decline in eGFR in both age groups, while a lack of habitual exercise and late-night dinners in the 60-74 age group and non-refreshing sleep in the 40-59 age group were identified as risk factors. Additionally, skipping breakfast was a risk factor for a rapid decline in eGFR in the 60-74 age group regardless of baseline eGFR levels. In the baseline eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73\u2009m2 subgroup, skipping breakfast and non-refreshed sleep were risk factors for a rapid decline in eGFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found specific lifestyle risk factors were associated with a rapid eGFR decline among people with type 2 diabetes from a nationwide database in Japan. The associations varied by baseline eGFR level, age, and sex. Lifestyle modifications may effectively prevent the aggravation of diabetic kidney disease."

            "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prevalent and possibly fatal cardiovascular ailment, and it is treated surgically by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients, are the most commonly affected. Even though CABG is a frequently employed procedure to restore cardiac blood flow, prolonged rehabilitation is necessary for long-term success. For patients with heart disease, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) involves a comprehensive therapeutic approach. It consists of risk mitigation, regular exercise, health education, and efficient stress management. Information and communication technology is used in telerehabilitation (TR), a rehabilitation service that offers a flexible choice that improves self-management. This study examined novel approaches and effective intervention elements while comparing cardiac TR with center-based programs in terms of risk factor management, patient commitment, and satisfaction."

            "abstract": "Metabolic flexibility refers to the ability of tissues to adapt their use of energy sources according to substrate availability and energy demands. This review aims to disentangle the emerging mechanisms through which altered metabolic flexibility and insulin resistance promote NAFLD and heart disease progression. Insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility are central drivers of hepatic and cardiac diseases in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Both play a critical role in the complex interaction between glucose and lipid metabolism. Disruption of metabolic flexibility results in hyperglycemia and abnormal lipid metabolism, leading to increased accumulation of fat in the liver, contributing to the development and progression of NAFLD. Similarly, insulin resistance affects cardiac glucose metabolism, leading to altered utilization of energy substrates and impaired cardiac function, and influence cardiac lipid metabolism, further exacerbating the progression of heart failure. Regular physical activity promotes metabolic flexibility by increasing energy expenditure and enabling efficient switching between different energy substrates. On the contrary, weight loss achieved through calorie restriction ameliorates insulin sensitivity without improving flexibility. Strategies that mimic the effects of physical exercise, such as pharmacological interventions or targeted lifestyle modifications, show promise in effectively treating both diabetes and NAFLD, finally reducing the risk of advanced liver disease."

            "abstract": "None: Obesity represents a significant public health concern, with one-third of adults classified as living with obesity in the United States.\u00a0Obesity correlates with cardiometabolic comorbidities that can decrease the quality of life. Researchers have proposed that exercise is an important lifestyle measure to maintain a healthy weight. This review will cover the role of exercise in obesity and fitness. Obesity is an excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 and above. Individuals in the BMI range of 25 to 30 kg/m2 are categorized as overweight, while a BMI of 40 kg/m2 and above is regarded as morbid obesity. Obesity correlates with an individual\u2019s increased risk of cancers, stroke, metabolic disease, heart failure, and other cardiovascular conditions, highlighting the need to reduce the incidence and prevalence of obesity. Chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity is hypothesized to have associations with adverse cardiometabolic\u00a0adverse effects. Although short-term inflammation is beneficial to initiate an immune response, chronically elevated levels of inflammation exhaust the immune system and contribute to immune dysfunction. Researchers posit that this inflammation is stimulated by the excess adipose tissue, which has consistently been shown to play a role as an active endocrine organ. Reducing adipose tissue is one of the ways to reduce weight in individuals with obesity and is necessary to mitigate negative cardio-metabolic comorbidities in obesity. Two methods exist that can effectively decrease adipose tissue and include: Dietary modification\u00a0. Energy expenditure modification (ie, exercise). Thus, increasing energy expenditure can help reduce excess adipose tissue and obesity. The current guidelines by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) include aerobic or anaerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise (eg, running, cycling, rowing) is an exercise that exhausts the oxygen in the muscles. Still, oxygen consumption is sufficient to supply the energy demands placed on the muscles and does not need to derive energy from another source. On the other hand, anaerobic exercise or resistance exercise, eg, weight lifting)is oxygen consumption insufficient to supply the energy demands placed on the muscles, and muscles must break down other energy supplies, such as sugars, to produce energy and lactic acid. Physical activity is included in the exercise, although it does not necessarily include structured exercise plans/sessions. The measurement of exercise is conducted in \u201cmetabolic equivalent tasks\u201d (METs), which roughly equate to the effort and energy expenditure it takes for an individual to sit quietly. Physical activity is frequently incorporated into different lifestyle interventions, highlighting the need for regular daily physical activity. Physical activity in the general lifestyle includes goal setting, problem-solving, leisure-time physical activity, and activity used for commuting. Outcomes of interest include cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, and muscular fitness. Recently, much literature has shown the positive effects of exercise on physical health and cognitive and emotional\u00a0well-being in people of all ages."

Improper exercise may induce an increased cardiovascular risk in older persons with coronary heart disease. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)-guided cardiac rehabilitation could be helpful for providing clinical evidence for cardiac rehabilitation therapy in older persons after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We retrospectively included older persons who underwent PCI and cardiac rehabilitation based on CPET at the Cardiac Rehabilitation Center of Peking University Third Hospital from January 2014 to December 2019.

Exercise has been proposed to prevent CTRCD, however, research to date has indicated high degrees of individual variability following exercise interventions in this population.\nAIM: This study aimed to explore the impact of regular, individualized aerobic exercise on CTRCD incidence (defined by global longitudinal strain [GLS]) during and immediately upon the completion of dose-dense anthracycline (DDAC) chemotherapy in 5 women with breast cancer.\nMETHODS: Five women receiving DDAC with stage I-III breast cancer enrolled. Participants underwent resting echocardiography and exercise testing before, during, upon the completion of, and 3\u2009months after the completion of DDAC treatment to measure GLS and aerobic fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>peak). Participants opted-in to an individualized 8-week aerobic exercise intervention (3 sessions per week, 24 sessions total) or standard care for the duration of their DDAC treatment. Data for each participant were presented descriptively.\nRESULTS: Four of the 5 participants completed the exercise intervention during DDAC treatment (adherence 79.2%-91.7%). Mild asymptomatic CTRCD occurred in 2 of the 4 exercising participants, of whom both were at an increased risk (one was &gt;65\u2009years of age and diagnosed with hypertension, with the other receiving trastuzumab prior to DDAC treatment). Varied responses in VO<sub>2</sub>peak were observed and did not align with changes in GLS. The only participant not to complete the exercise intervention reported poorer health related quality of life and increased cancer related fatigue at all measurement timepoints.\nCONCLUSION: This study details the individual variability in cardiovascular responses to exercise that can occur during DDAC treatment in women with breast cancer, which can inform exercise professionals and researchers when designing individualized exercise programs for this population."

However, the association between the regular PPIs use and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether regular proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use is associated with an altered incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population.\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study included 459,207 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [8.1] years) from the UK Biobank study without prevalent CVD who enrolled between 2006 and 2010 and were followed until 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident CVD and its components (coronary heart disease [CHD], stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism) were obtained using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounding factors, including demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, prevalent comorbidities, and clinical indicators for PPIs use.\nRESULTS: During the follow-up period, we recorded 26,346 incident CVD events (including 13,749 CHD events, 4144 stroke events, 5812 atrial fibrillation events, 1159 heart failure events, and 4206 venous thromboembolism events). The fully adjusted HRs (and 95% CIs) associated with PPIs users compared to nonusers were 1.44 (95% CI 1.39-1.50) for incident CVD, 1.65 (95% CI 1.57-1.74) for CHD, 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.33) for stroke, 1.17 (95% CI 1.08-1.28) for atrial fibrillation, 1.61 (95% CI 1.37-1.89) for heart failure, and 1.36 (95% CI 1.24-1.50) for venous thromboembolism.\nCONCLUSIONS: Regular PPIs use was associated with higher risk of CVD outcomes.

            "abstract": "Vascular aging, featuring endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffening, is a major risk factor for the development of age-associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Vascular aging is largely mediated by an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased inflammation leading to reduced bioavailability of the vasodilatory molecule nitric oxide and remodeling of the arterial wall. Other cellular mechanisms (i.e., mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired stress response, deregulated nutrient sensing, cellular senescence), termed \"hallmarks\" or \"pillars\" of aging, may also contribute to vascular aging. Gonadal aging, which largely impacts women but also impacts some men, modulates the vascular aging process. Regular physical activity, including both aerobic and resistance exercise, is a first-line strategy for reducing CVD risk with aging. Although exercise is an effective intervention to counter vascular aging, there is considerable variation in the vascular response to exercise training with aging. Aerobic exercise improves large elastic artery stiffening in both middle-aged/older men and women and enhances endothelial function in middle-aged/older men by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and preserving nitric oxide bioavailability; however, similar aerobic exercise training improvements are not consistently observed in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women. Sex differences in adaptations to exercise may be related to gonadal aging and declines in estrogen in women that influence cellular-molecular mechanisms, disconnecting favorable signaling in the vasculature induced by exercise training. The present review will summarize the current state of knowledge on vascular adaptations to regular aerobic and resistance exercise with aging, the underlying mechanisms involved, and the moderating role of biological sex."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in cardiac pathophysiology. However, the role of circRNAs in response to exercise training and biological mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced cardiac protection remain largely unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: RNA sequencing was used to profile circRNA expression in adult mouse cardiomyocytes that were isolated from mice with or without exercise training. Exercise-induced circRNA circUtrn was significantly increased in swimming-trained adult mouse cardiomyocytes. In vivo, circUtrn was found to be required for exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy. circUtrn inhibition abolished the protective effects of exercise on myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion remodelling. circUtrn overexpression prevented myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion-induced acute injury and pathological cardiac remodelling. In vitro, overexpression of circUtrn promoted H9 human embryonic stem cell-induced cardiomyocyte growth and survival via protein phosphatase 5 (PP5). Mechanistically, circUtrn directly bound to PP5 and regulated the stability of PP5 in a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1-dependent splicing factor SF3B1 acted as an upstream regulator of circUtrn in cardiomyocytes.\nCONCLUSION: The circRNA circUtrn is upregulated upon exercise training in the heart. Overexpression of circUtrn can prevent myocardial I/R-induced injury and pathological cardiac remodelling."

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women in developed societies. Unfavorable structural and functional adaptations within the heart and central blood vessels with sedentary aging in women can act as the substrate for the development of debilitating CVD conditions such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The large decline in cardiorespiratory fitness, as indicated by maximal or peak oxygen uptake (V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub> and V\u0307o<sub>2peak</sub>, respectively), that occurs in women as they age significantly affects their health and chronic disease status, as well as the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Midlife and older women who have performed structured endurance exercise training for several years or decades of their adult lives exhibit a V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub> and cardiac and vascular structure and function that are on par or even superior to much younger sedentary women. Therefore, regular endurance exercise training appears to be an effective preventative strategy for mitigating the adverse physiological cardiovascular adaptations associated with sedentary aging in women. Herein, we narratively describe the aging and short- and long-term endurance exercise training adaptations in V\u0307o<sub>2max</sub>, cardiac structure, and left ventricular systolic and diastolic function at rest and exercise in midlife and older women. The role of circulating estrogens on cardiac structure and function is described for consideration in the timing of exercise interventions to maximize beneficial adaptations.

Treatment of hypertension reduces morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The use of ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring improves diagnostic accuracy. Assessment of adults with hypertension should focus on identifying complications of the condition and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors. Physicians should counsel all patients with elevated blood pressure about effective lifestyle interventions, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, dietary sodium restriction, potassium enrichment, regular exercise, weight loss, and moderation of alcohol consumption. First-line antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Thresholds for pharmacologic intervention and blood pressure goals differ according to various guidelines. Evidence strongly supports reducing blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with hypertension. Lowering blood pressure to less than 135/85 mm Hg may further reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Clinical judgment and shared decision-making should guide treatment of patients with mild hypertension and older adults who may be more susceptible to adverse effects of antihypertensive medications and tight blood pressure control."

            "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the efficacy of vitamin C for preventing and treating respiratory infections. Studies in a wide variety of animals have shown vitamin C to be protective against infections. In controlled trials in the general human population, vitamin C at a dose greater than 1 g/day did not prevent common colds. However, in 5 trials with participants undertaking heavy physical activity, vitamin C halved the incidence of colds. In 15 trials (n = 6244), regular supplementation of 1 g or more of vitamin C per day decreased the severity of colds by 15%. Results of therapeutic trials in which vitamin C was initiated after the onset of common cold symptoms have been inconsistent. However, 2 therapeutic trials found that 6-8 g/day of vitamin C was twice as effective at reducing the duration of colds as 3-4 g/day. In 3 controlled trials, vitamin C was shown to prevent pneumonia, but the contexts were atypical: the participants were schoolboys attending a boarding school in the United Kingdom before World War II, soldiers hospitalized for influenza A, and United States Marine recruits. It is unlikely that vitamin C would reduce the risk of pneumonia in the general population; however, 4 trials reported a treatment benefit for pneumonia patients, although the findings encourage further research rather than providing firm evidence of efficacy. Vitamin C has been tested for efficacy in COVID\u201119 and sepsis with conflicting results. Given the evidence that vitamin C reduces the severity and duration of the common cold, paired with its good safety profile and low cost, it is not unreasonable for patients to test whether therapeutic vitamin C supplementation at a dose of 6-8 g/day is beneficial at the individual level."

Although it is well known that a balanced diet which satisfies the daily intake of vitamin C positively affects the immune system and reduces susceptibility to infections, available data do not support the theory that oral vitamin C supplements boost immunity. No current clinical recommendations support the possibility of significantly decreasing the risk of respiratory infections by using high-dose supplements of vitamin C in a well-nourished general population. Only in restricted subgroups (e.g., athletes or the military) and in subjects with a low plasma vitamin C concentration a supplementation may be justified. Furthermore, in categories at high risk of infection (i.e., the obese, diabetics, the elderly, etc.), a vitamin C supplementation can modulate inflammation, with potential positive effects on immune response to infections. The impact of an extra oral intake of vitamin C on the duration of a cold and the prevention or treatment of pneumonia is still questioned, while, based on critical illness studies, vitamin C infusion has recently been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In this review, we focused on the effects of vitamin C on immune function, summarizing the most relevant studies from the prevention and treatment of common respiratory diseases to the use of vitamin C in critical illness conditions, with the aim of clarifying its potential application during an acute SARS-CoV2 infection."

We also searched the U.S. National Institutes of Health trials register and WHO ICTRP on 29 November 2012.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We excluded trials which used less than 0.2 g per day of vitamin C and trials without a placebo comparison. We restricted our review to placebo-controlled trials.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed 'incidence' of colds during regular supplementation as the proportion of participants experiencing one or more colds during the study period. 'Duration' was the mean number of days of illness of cold episodes.\nMAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine trial comparisons involving 11,306 participants contributed to the meta-analysis on the risk ratio (RR) of developing a cold whilst taking vitamin C regularly over the study period. In the general community trials involving 10,708 participants, the pooled RR was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.00). Five trials involving a total of 598 marathon runners, skiers and soldiers on subarctic exercises yielded a pooled RR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.64).Thirty-one comparisons examined the effect of regular vitamin C on common cold duration (9745 episodes). In adults the duration of colds was reduced by 8% (3% to 12%) and in children by 14% (7% to 21%). In children, 1 to 2 g/day vitamin C shortened colds by 18%. The severity of colds was also reduced by regular vitamin C administration.Seven comparisons examined the effect of therapeutic vitamin C (3249 episodes). No consistent effect of vitamin C was seen on the duration or severity of colds in the therapeutic trials.The majority of included trials were randomised, double-blind trials. The exclusion of trials that were either not randomised or not double-blind had no effect on the conclusions.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin C supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin C may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. Regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin C reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out. Nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin C on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin C is beneficial for them. Further therapeutic RCTs are warranted."

We assessed the vitamin and mineral intake of ultraendurance athletes in their regular diet, in addition to oral vitamin and mineral supplements. Thirty-seven ultraendurance triathletes (24 men and 13 women) completed a 7-day nutrition diary including a questionnaire to determine nutrition adequacy and supplement intake. Compared with dietary reference intakes for the general population, both male and female triathletes met or exceeded all except for vitamin D. In addition, female athletes consumed slightly less than the recommended daily intake for folate and potassium; however, the difference was trivial. Over 60% of the athletes reported using vitamin supplements, of which vitamin C (97.5%), vitamin E (78.3%), and multivitamins (52.2%) were the most commonly used supplements. Almost half (47.8%) the athletes who used supplements did so to prevent or reduce cold symptoms. Only 1 athlete used supplements on formal medical advice. Vitamin C and E supplementation was common in ultraendurance triathletes, despite no evidence of dietary deficiency in these 2 vitamins."

Supplementation of vitamin C was found to improve components of the human immune system such as antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities, lymphocyte proliferation, chemotaxis, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Vitamin C contributes to maintaining the redox integrity of cells and thereby protects them against reactive oxygen species generated during the respiratory burst and in the inflammatory response. Likewise, zinc undernutrition or deficiency was shown to impair cellular mediators of innate immunity such as phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity, and the generation of oxidative burst. Therefore, both nutrients play important roles in immune function and the modulation of host resistance to infectious agents, reducing the risk, severity, and duration of infectious diseases. This is of special importance in populations in which insufficient intake of these nutrients is prevalent. In the developing world, this is the case in low- and middle-income countries, but also in subpopulations in industrialized countries, e.g. in the elderly. A large number of randomized controlled intervention trials with intakes of up to 1 g of vitamin C and up to 30 mg of zinc are available. These trials document that adequate intakes of vitamin C and zinc ameliorate symptoms and shorten the duration of respiratory tract infections including the common cold. Furthermore, vitamin C and zinc reduce the incidence and improve the outcome of pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea infections, especially in children in developing countries."

(2) Does taking vitamin C in high doses at the onset of a cold have a therapeutic effect?\nSEARCH STRATEGY: This review currently deals only with published trials from two previously published reviews by Kleijnen 1989 and Hemila 1992.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and non-randomised trials of vitamin C taken to prevent or treat the common cold.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.\nMAIN RESULTS: Thirty trials were included. The quality of the included trials was variable. Vitamin C in doses as high as one gram daily for several winter months, had no consistent beneficial effect on incidence of the common cold. For both preventive and therapeutic trials, there was a consistently beneficial but generally modest therapeutic effect on duration of cold symptoms. This effect was variable, ranging from -0.07% to a 39% reduction in symptom days. The weighted difference across all of the studies revealed a reduction of a little less than half a symptom day per cold episode, representing an 8% to 9% reduction in symptom days. There was no clear indication of the relative benefits of different regimes or vitamin C doses. However in trials that tested vitamin C after cold symptoms occurred, there was some evidence that a large dose produced greater benefits than lower doses.\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Long term daily supplementation with vitamin C in large doses daily does not appear to prevent colds. There appears to be a modest benefit in reducing duration of cold symptoms from ingestion of relatively high doses of vitamin C. The relation of dose to therapeutic benefit needs further exploration."

His quantitative conclusions were based on a single placebo-controlled trial on schoolchildren in a skiing camp in the Swiss Alps, in which a significant decrease in common cold incidence and duration in the group administered 1 g/day of vitamin C was found. As children in a skiing camp are not a representative sample of the general population, Pauling's extrapolation to the population at large was too bold, erring as to the magnitude of the effect. Nevertheless, Pauling's general conclusion that vitamin C has physiological effects on the common cold is of major importance as it conflicts with the prevailing consensus that the only physiological effect of vitamin C on human beings is to prevent scurvy."

Participants were community-dwelling cognitively normal adults (mean age = 75.2\u2009years), including 29 men and 22 women. Three months of hormone intervention (for women, 0.625\u2009mg/day conjugated equine estrogen with or without 2.5\u2009mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate; for men, 200\u2009mg intramuscular testosterone enanthate every 2\u2009weeks) were crossed over with 3\u2009months of identical placebo with a 3-month washout between intervention phases. The main outcome measure was neuroticism and conscientiousness personality domains and facets assessed with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) after the active and placebo intervention phases.\nRESULTS: In linear mixed-effect models, HT in women decreased conscientiousness (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01) and the conscientiousness facet of achievement striving (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01), and increased vulnerability, a facet of neuroticism (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). Testosterone in men decreased conscientiousness (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) and the conscientiousness facet of dutifulness (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05), and increased vulnerability (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: In a preliminary study of healthy older adults, HT and TT formulations produced adverse changes in vulnerability and conscientiousness facets that parallel personality changes in dementia."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and impairment of physical performance and mobility are age-related clinical problems with major negative impact on quality of life of elderly men. In how far the decline of testosterone production contributes to these problems in older men and whether testosterone therapy can contribute to slow down, prevent, or reverse their development remains subjects of debate.\nOBJECTIVES: This narrative review presents the current knowledge on association of sex steroid status with cognitive decline and impairment of physical function and mobility in elderly men and on the effects of testosterone therapy on cognition and on physical performance and mobility in elderly men.\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: The review is based on electronic database searches with primary focus on evidence from larger prospective observational studies and from controlled randomized trials, respectively.\nRESULTS: In most observational studies, testosterone levels do not predict cognitive decline or development of Alzheimer's disease. In randomized trials, testosterone therapy did not significantly affect cognition in men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone, regardless of whether they have preexisting cognitive impairment. Overall, observational data indicate that the usually moderate decline of androgen exposure in older men cannot fully account for the parallel decline of physical performance and mobility. Trials of testosterone therapy in older men with low or low-normal serum testosterone, whether they were generally healthy or suffered from physical function impairments, either did not show any effect on mobility and physical performance or showed limited effects of uncertain clinical relevancy.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The whole of the evidence tends to downplay the role of sex steroid status in the decline of cognitive function and impairment of physical function and mobility in older men. Based on the available evidence, prevention or treatment of cognitive decline or of impairment of mobility and physical function are not valid indications for testosterone treatment in older men with low or low-to-normal serum testosterone levels."

            "abstract": "In the last decade, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has been increasingly prescribed to treat a controversial condition known as 'late-onset hypogonadism (LOH)'. This syndrome is diagnosed in men who, for no discernible reason other than older age, obesity or ill health have serum testosterone concentrations below the normal range for healthy young men and report one or more of the following symptoms: muscle weakness or wasting, mood, behaviour and cognition-related symptoms and sexual function or libido impairment. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that testosterone drugs do not substantially ameliorate these symptoms and, more worryingly, that their long-term use may be associated with severe adverse effects (i.e. increased risk of prostate cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction, worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and testicular atrophy). Nonetheless, testosterone drugs have exhibited extraordinary commercial success and their pharmaceutical sales are steadily rising. Behind this apparently unjustifiable trend there are deliberate, well designed direct and indirect pharmaceutical marketing initiatives that exploit the conviction rooted in contemporary society that testosterone can reverse the effects of ageing and ensure social accomplishment. Commercial mechanisms have laid the foundation for disease mongering of LOH and also have resulted a considerable expansion of the indications for treatment. This promotion model deserves particular attention since it is applicable to any drug with a purportedly favourable risk-benefit ratio not supported by evidence."

            "abstract": "Testosterone (T) levels decline as men age, but it is unclear whether this has an effect on cognition. Some studies indicate that lower T levels are associated with memory loss; thus, maintaining a higher T level could have positive effects on aspects of cognitive function. Concerns exist, however, about the effect of T therapy on the prostate in older men. We hypothesized that T replacement in older men with low T levels would improve aspects of cognitive function and that the addition of finasteride would not affect the T-induced cognitive improvements. Healthy men, 65 to 83 years of age, with baseline total T below 350 ng/dL and no evidence of cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 regimens: 200 mg of T every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection with placebo pill daily (T-only), 200 mg of T every 2 weeks by intramuscular injection with 5 mg of finasteride daily (T+F), or placebo injections and pills (placebo). Sixty-nine men completed baseline cognitive testing; 65 completed at least 4 months, and 46 completed all 36 months of the study. Participants were given a battery of cognitive evaluations at baseline, 4 months, and 36 months, along with measurement of serum hormone levels. Serum total T, bioavailable T, and estradiol levels in the T-only and T+F groups significantly increased throughout the treatment period, whereas these hormone levels did not change in the placebo group. Only minimally significant differences were seen among the 3 groups in any evaluation of cognitive performance, either in the short-term (4 months) or the long-term (36 months) analysis. These results indicate that T replacement, whether given alone or in combination with finasteride, for 36 months in healthy older men without cognitive impairment at baseline has no clinically significant effect on tests of cognitive function. Further studies are warranted to determine whether hormone replacement in men with preexisting cognitive impairment is beneficial."

            "abstract": "Despite nearly a half-century of research on aging and sex steroids in men, answers to key questions that would allow us to confidently assess risk:benefit ratios for androgen replacement in older men with the partial androgen deficiency of aging men (PADAM) syndrome remain uncertain. Although it is now reasonably clear that a significant percentage of otherwise healthy older men have decreases in testosterone and bioavailable testosterone to levels consistent with hypogonadism, the clinical implications of this change remain uncertain. Data suggest that low testosterone in older men is correlated to varying degrees with loss of lean body mass and muscle strength, and increased total and central body fat. Less certain, but suggestive, are data relating low testosterone levels to decreased bone density, loss of insulin sensitivity, and cognitive and affective deterioration, as well as reduced sexual function. Replacement of testosterone in older men has shown some positive effects on each of these variables, but findings have been inconsistent, perhaps because studies have employed different preparations and doses of androgens, treated for various durations, and defined their target populations in different ways. As important as beneficial effects is the potential for adverse effects, which may be greater in older men. Possible problems include sleep apnea, erythrocytosis, dyslipidemia with acceleration of atherosclerosis, and, of greatest concern, prostate cancer or hyperplasia. Studies to date have suggested that these outcomes are not major risks, but, in the absence of a large, randomized trial or trials, definitive information is not available. The US National Academies Institute of Medicine's recent report recommends that the National Institutes of Health support small efficacy trials aimed at treatment of androgen deficiency-related clinical conditions, but not a large, randomized trial to elucidate risk:benefit ratios. This recommendation, if adhered to, is likely to delay, rather than foster, progress in this important area."

            "abstract": "Serum testosterone levels decline gradually and progressively with aging in men. Many manifestations associated with aging in men, including muscle atrophy and weakness, osteoporosis, reduced sexual functioning, and increased fat mass, are similar to changes associated with testosterone deficiency in young men. These similarities suggest that testosterone supplementation may prevent or reverse the effects of aging. A MEDLINE search was performed to identify studies of testosterone supplementation therapy in older men. A structured, qualitative review was performed of placebo-controlled trials that included men aged 60 and older and evaluated one or more physical, cognitive, affective, functional, or quality-of-life outcomes. Studies focusing on patients with severe systemic diseases and hormone deficiencies related to specific diseases were excluded. In healthy older men with low-normal to mildly decreased testosterone levels, testosterone supplementation increased lean body mass and decreased fat mass. Upper and lower body strength, functional performance, sexual functioning, and mood were improved or unchanged with testosterone replacement. Variable effects on cognitive function were reported, with improvements in some cognitive domains (e.g., spatial, working, and verbal memory). Testosterone supplementation improved exercise-induced coronary ischemia in men with coronary heart disease, whereas angina pectoris was improved or unchanged. In a few studies, men with low testosterone levels were more likely to experience improvements in lumbar bone mineral density, self-perceived functional status, libido, erectile function, and exercise-induced coronary ischemia with testosterone replacement than men with less marked testosterone deficiency. No major unfavorable effects on lipids were reported, but hematocrit and prostate specific antigen levels often increased. Based on these results, testosterone supplementation cannot be recommended at this time for older men with normal or low-normal testosterone levels and no clinical manifestations of hypogonadism. However, testosterone replacement may be warranted in older men with markedly decreased testosterone levels, regardless of symptoms, and in men with mildly decreased testosterone levels and symptoms or signs suggesting hypogonadism. The long-term safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation remain uncertain. Establishment of evidence-based indications will depend on further demonstrations of favorable clinical outcomes and symptomatic, functional, and quality-of-life benefits in carefully performed, long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mixed milk feeding is defined as providing formula and/or animal milk along with breast milk to infants under six months old which is prevalent in many countries. However, this practice is generally not recommended as it can reduce the intake of breast milk, depriving the infant of its optimal nutritional and immunological benefits. Unlike formula, breast milk contains complex bioactive constituents that promote intestinal and pancreatic growth and develop mucosal defenses. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution and predictors of MMF practices in Ethiopia.\nMETHODS: This study utilized data from the 2019 Mini-Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (MiniEDHS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted from March to June 2019. The total weighted sample size derived from the data examined in this study amounted to 524 infants. The data analysis used Global Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation and the Getis-Ord Gi\u2009* statistic for local cluster analysis to assess the spatial distribution of mixed milk feeding prevalence across Ethiopia's administrative regions and cities. Empirical Bayesian Kriging was used for spatial interpolation to estimate mixed milk feeding prevalence in unsampled areas. The analysis utilized a maximum spatial cluster size threshold of 50% of the population to detect clusters of varying sizes. Ordinary least squares regression analysis identified significant spatial predictors. In geographically weighted regression analysis, the effect of predictor variables on the spatial variation of mixed milk feeding was detected using local coefficients.\nRESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence of Mixed Milk Feeding (MMF) in Ethiopia was 10.12% (95% CI: 7.8, 13.01). This prevalence shows significant regional variations across the country emphasizing regional disparities in prevalence and distribution. The Global Moran's I statistic was 0.14, with a Z-score of 3.18 and a p-value of <\u20090.001, indicating a significant spatial clustering of MMF prevalence. Hotspots of mixed milk feeding were identified in Somali, Dire Dawa, and Afar, while cold spots were observed in Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz, SNNPR, and parts of Oromia. Household wealth (middle wealth index) and lack of baby postnatal checkups emerged as key influencers of mixed milk feeding practices.\nCONCLUSION: The study found significant regional variations in mixed milk feeding practices in Ethiopia. Households with middle wealth index and baby without postnatal check were significant spatial predictors of mixed milk feeding. To reduce mixed milk feeding prevalence, targeted interventions should engage community leaders, enhance breastfeeding education in maternal health services, and integrate counseling into routine healthcare to support informed maternal choices and improve child health outcomes nationwide."

However, the potential advantages of breastfeeding extend well beyond initial months. Breast milk adapts to the evolving needs of the growing infant, and its immunological, microbiological, and biochemical properties have been associated with enhanced protection against infections and chronic diseases, improved growth and development, and lower rates of hospitalization and mortality. This review explores the evidence supporting the continuation of breastfeeding beyond six months. More meticulous studies employing consistent methodologies and addressing confounders are essential.

            "abstract": "Breastfeeding provides important immunological benefits to the neonate, but how the different immunoactive components in breastmilk contribute to immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized human breastmilk T cells using single-cell RNA-Seq and flow cytometry. Breastmilk contained predominantly memory T cells, with expression of immune signaling genes, high proliferation, and an effector Th1/cytotoxic profile with high cytokine production capacities. Elevated activation was balanced by an enriched Treg population and immune regulatory markers in conventional memory T cells. Gene and surface expression of tissue-residency markers indicate that breastmilk T cells represented tissue-adapted rather than circulatory T cells. In addition, breastmilk T cells had a broad homing profile and higher activation markers in these migratory subsets. The partly overlapping transcriptome profile between breastmilk and breast tissue T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells, might support a role in local immune defense in the mammary gland. However, unique features of breastmilk, such as Tregs, might imply an additional role in neonatal immune support. We found some correlations between the breastmilk T cell profile and clinical parameters, most notably with maternal and household factors. Together, our data suggest that breastmilk contains an adapted T cell population that exerts their function in specific tissue sites."

Weight and length were measured from 0 to 12 months of age. Using generalised linear models, we estimated effects of DP vs. SP on gravidity-stratified mean length-for-age (LAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ). We investigated mediation by placental malaria, gestational weight change, maternal anaemia, maternal inflammation-related proteins, preterm birth, birth length, and birth weight. Mediation models adjusted for infant sex, gravidity, gestational age at enrolment, maternal age, maternal parasitaemia at enrolment, education, and wealth.\nFINDINGS: SP increased mean LAZ by 0.18-0.28 Z from birth through age 4 months compared to DP, while DP increased mean WLZ by 0.11-0.28 Z from 2 to 8 months compared to SP among infants of multigravidae; at these ages, confidence intervals for mean differences excluded 0. We did not observe differences among primigravida. Mediators of SP included birth weight, birth length, maternal stem cell factor, and DNER. Mediators of DP included placental malaria and birth length, maternal IL-18, CDCP1, and CD6 at delivery.\nINTERPRETATION: In high malaria transmission settings, this exploratory study suggests different IPTp regimens may influence infant growth among multigravidae, potentially through distinct pathways, in the exclusive breastfeeding period, when few other interventions are available.\nFUNDING: Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."

The objective of the study was to expand knowledge about breastfeeding and the degree of contribution of breast milk to the feeding of infants with IEM before and after the introduction of expanded newborn screening. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on 127 infants born between 1997 and 2020: 66 with phenylketonuria (PKU), 45 with other IEM (non-PKU), all diagnosed through newborn screening (NBS), and 16 non-PKU diagnosed through selective screening (SS). The time of initiation of dietary treatment and the proportion of breast milk in the diet, both expressed and breastfed, with or without intake control, were analysed at 1, 3, and 6 months after birth. For 47% of the newborns in Groups 1 and 2, the dietary treatment was started before the 10th day of life; in Group 3, the dietary treatment was started after the 10th day of life for all children. During the first month of life, the proportion of infants receiving breast milk was higher in the NBS-PKU (74%) and the NBS non-PKU (80%) groups, compared with 38% in the SS non-PKU infants. In the subsequent months of life, the proportion of infants receiving human milk (either from the breast or a bottle) declined in all groups. This decline occurred more in bottle-fed rather than directly breast-fed infants. Our observations indicate that the model of feeding from a bottle with expressed milk may have had an adverse effect on maintaining lactation and may have contributed to a faster transition to formula milk. Maintaining lactation and extending the period of feeding the infant with human milk in the first 6 months of life is possible by breastfeeding on demand, under regular biochemical monitoring: preferably weekly in PKU infants, and at least every 2-4 weeks in infants with other IEM."

The study was composed of two groups; the sepsis group involved full-term neonates appropriate for gestational age with sepsis-related clinical signs. The control group included newborns with no signs of clinical/laboratory infection within 72\u00a0h of life. Blood samples were collected on admission during the first three days of life in both groups for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, Complete Blood Count (CBC), C reactive protein (CRP), and blood culture.\nRESULTS: Forty-five newborns with clinical and laboratory findings of early-onset neonatal sepsis within 72\u00a0h of life were enrolled, and the control group included forty-five newborns with no evidence of sepsis. Vitamin D levels in the sepsis group were significantly lower than in the control group.

The complement components in breast milk were shown to directly lyse specific members of gram-positive gut commensal microbiota via a C1-dependent, antibody-independent mechanism, resulting in the deposition of the membrane attack complex and subsequent bacterial lysis.

            "abstract": "The value of breastfeeding surpasses its utilitarian role in nourishing, encompassing profound psychological advantages for mothers and children. The orchestration of emotional bonds relies on the interplay of oxytocin and prolactin, fundamental hormones that underpin maternal attachment, mitigate postpartum depression, and cultivate self-confidence. Simultaneously, breastfeeding promotes infant development by fostering robust brain growth, bolstering immune defenses, and nurturing cognitive and emotional maturation - all of which are nurtured through maternal interactions. We must respond to the call for heightened advocacy of breastfeeding. This entails delivering education, easily accessible support, and creating an environment where breastfeeding is normalized. By dispelling misconceptions and eradicating stigmatization associated with breastfeeding, we can amplify awareness and empower mothers to make well-informed decisions for their newborns. These implications reverberate extensively. Enhanced maternal mental well-being and self-assurance form the bedrock of healthier family dynamics. At the same time, the dividends of cognitive, emotional, and immunological enrichment in children represent a more promising future. At a societal level, the embrace and promotion of breastfeeding cultivate an environment that places immense value on the health and happiness of both mothers and children. This journey is more profound than mere sustenance; it signifies a complex web of advantages. Elevating awareness and support for breastfeeding solidifies the global commitment to comprehensive maternal and child welfare and the flourishing of meaningful relationships."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many infants in low-resourced settings at high risk of infectious disease morbidity and death are deprived of the immunological and nutritional benefits of breast milk, through an attenuated duration of breast milk exposure. South Africa has one of the lowest exclusive breastfeeding rates in Africa, with 8% of infants under 6\u00a0months of age. We assume that breastfeeding is sustained among women living with HIV receiving weekly text messages and motivational interviewing and that this contributes to improved infant health outcomes.\nOBJECTIVES: (1) To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention of mobile phone text messaging and motivational interviewing in promoting (a) exclusive breastfeeding and (b) any form of breastfeeding, until 6\u00a0months of child age, compared to usual care, among mothers living with HIV. (2) To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention on (a) reduction in all-cause hospitalization and mortality rates and (b) improvements in infant linear growth, compared to usual care, among HIV-exposed infants aged 0-6\u00a0months.\nMETHODS: We are conducting a clinical trial to determine whether text messaging plus motivational interviewing prolongs breastfeeding and improves infant health outcomes. We are recruiting 275 women living with HIV and their HIV-exposed infants at birth and randomly assign study interventions for 6\u00a0months.\nSTATISTICAL METHODS: Breastfeeding rates are compared between the study groups using a standard proportion test and binomial regression. Survival endpoints are presented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared between the study groups using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. The count endpoint is analysed using the Poisson random-effects model and mean cumulative function. We use mixed linear regression models to assess the evolution of infant growth over time. The maximum likelihood method will be used to handle missing data.\nDISCUSSION: The study findings may facilitate decision-making on (1) whether implementation of the breastfeeding policy achieved the desired outcomes, (2) interventions needed to sustain breastfeeding, and (3) whether the interventions do have an impact on child health.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05063240.

            "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has notably impacted healthcare systems and everyday life worldwide. Regulatory authorities have approved the emergency use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to the rapid spread of the virus. However, during vaccination testing, pregnant and breastfeeding women were initially excluded, leading to a lack of evidence-based recommendations. When taking the COVID-19 pandemic into account, breastfeeding has emerged as a potential defense mechanism against this infection due to its numerous benefits for newborns. Human breast milk contains immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), lactoferrin, and various cells\u00a0that play an inevitable role in the newborn's protection against respiratory infections and immune system development. Various studies have highlighted that the onset and severity of respiratory infections in infants can be reduced through breastfeeding, and the effects are noticeable during the first six months of life and that breast milk also has the potential to enhance mucosal immunity and promote a diverse microbiome, reducing the risk of asthma, allergies, and enteric diseases through the provision of specific antibodies and immunological factors. Researchers have indicated that breastfeeding mothers who contracted and recovered from COVID-19 or received vaccination passed protective antibodies to their infants through breast milk. Although rare cases of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk have been reported, the virus has not been cultured from these samples, suggesting a low risk of transmission to the breastfed baby. However, further research is essential to understand the extent of protection provided by breast milk against COVID-19 and the potential effect of distinct phases of lactation. Nonetheless, the current evidence supports the benefits and safety of breastfeeding during the pandemic. With appropriate safety measures, promoting breastfeeding can contribute to the overall health and well-being of infants during the phase of COVID-19."

            "abstract": "Since ancient times, breastfeeding has been the fundamental way of nurturing the newborn. The benefits of breast milk are widely known, as it is a source of essential nutrients and provides immunological protection, as well as developmental benefits, among others. However, when breastfeeding is not possible, infant formula is the most appropriate alternative. Its composition meets the nutritional requirements of the infant, and its quality is subject to strict control by the authorities. Nonetheless, the presence of different pollutants has been detected in both matrices. Thus, the aim of the present review is to make a comparison between the findings in both breast milk and infant formula in terms of contaminants in the last decade, in order to choose the most convenient option depending on the environmental conditions. For that, the emerging pollutants including metals, chemical compounds derived from heat treatment, pharmaceutical drugs, mycotoxins, pesticides, packaging materials, and other contaminants were described. While in breast milk the most concerning contaminants found were metals and pesticides, in infant formula pollutants such as metals, mycotoxins, and packaging materials were the most outstanding. In conclusion, the convenience of using a feeding diet based on breast milk or either infant formula depends on the maternal environmental circumstances. However, it is important to take into account the immunological benefits of the breast milk compared to the infant formula, and the possibility of using breast milk in combination with infant formula when the nutritional requirements are not fulfilled only with the intake of breast milk. Therefore, more attention should be paid in terms of analyzing these conditions in each case to be able to make a proper decision, as it will vary depending on the maternal and newborn environment."

However, mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) must express their milk (pump-dependent) and often struggle with milk production.\nPURPOSE: To examine the state of the science on nonpharmacologic modifiable expression factors that may influence milk production in pump-dependent mothers of critically ill infants admitted to the NICU.\nDATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases from 2005 to 2020.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: Guided by the lactation conceptual model, the authors searched for peer-reviewed studies with terms related to milk volume, pump dependency, critically ill infants, and modifiable factors, which may influence milk volume and assessed 46 eligible studies.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 3 reviewers with a systematic staged review approach.\nRESULTS: Evidence from 26 articles found expressed milk volume may be influenced by multiple potentially modifiable factors. Simultaneous expression with a hospital-grade electric pump at least 5 times per day beginning 3 to 6 hours after delivery, and adding complementary techniques including hand expression, hands-on-pumping, music, breast massage, warm compresses, skin-to-skin care, and the mother expressing near her infant may promote increased milk volume.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Healthcare providers should assist pump-dependent mothers with early initiation and frequent milk removal with a hospital-grade breast pump. Further research is needed to explore optimal frequency of expressions, dose and timing of skin-to-skin care, and other targeted strategies to improve expressed milk volume."

            "abstract": "Infancy has been proven as the best time to improve health outcomes for the later stage of life. The composition of human breast milk has evolved over millennia to support and maintain the infant's life during the early years of life. To achieve life-sustaining effects, human breast milk is packed with fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and a wide range of bioactive compounds such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and cytokines. The immunological compounds in breast milk have been shown to curtail gastrointestinal tract infections, respiratory tract infections, hospital admissions, acute otitis media, allergic reactions, and urinary tract infections. Although breastfeeding causes newborns to gain less weight at the beginning of their lives\u00a0than formula milk does, breast milk improves body composition by low adiposity. A higher adipose deposition in infants is linked with an increased risk of child obesity in the future. Due to significant health benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends initiating breastfeeding within one hour after birth and continuing for at least six months. Breastfeeding has emerged as a superior source of nutrition that can promote healthy physiological and cognitive development and protect against disease challenges in low birthweight infants. This review summarizes potential evidence that highlights the potential health impact of breast milk in low birthweight infants."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) are not recommended during pregnancy, and discouraged while breastfeeding. However, discontinuation of some DMTs before pregnancy can leave women vulnerable to MS relapses. Although available data on ocrelizumab suggest no increased risk in terms of pregnancy or neonatal outcomes, it is unknown whether ocrelizumab transfers across the placenta or is absorbed through breastmilk; and if so, whether infant B cell development, immune responses or growth and development are affected. This manuscript describes two studies designed to address these uncertainties.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: MINORE and SOPRANINO are multicentre open-label studies. MINORE, which addresses placental transfer, will recruit 44 women with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) exposed to ocrelizumab between 6\u00a0months before the last menstrual period (LMP) to the end of the first trimester. It will evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of potential in utero exposure through the proportion of infants with B cell numbers below lower limit of normal (LLN) at week 6 of life (primary endpoint); as well as through vaccine-induced antibody responses (reflecting B cell function) during the first year of life. Placental transfer will be assessed through measurement of ocrelizumab concentrations in paired samples at delivery (maternal blood as well as umbilical cord blood), and infant serum at week 6 of life. SOPRANINO, which evaluates breastmilk transfer, will recruit 20 women with MS or CIS who resume or initiate ocrelizumab treatment while breastfeeding. The effect of potential exposure through breastmilk will be assessed through the proportion of infants with B cell levels below LLN at 30 days after the mother's first post-partum ocrelizumab infusion (co-primary endpoint). Infant exposure via breastmilk will be assessed through ocrelizumab average daily infant dose in breastmilk over 60\u00a0days after the same infusion (co-primary endpoint). Vaccine-induced responses will be measured as in MINORE. Both studies will also measure infant growth and development over the first year of life and safety outcomes in both mothers and infants. All analyses will be descriptive, under an estimand framework.\nDISCUSSION: Both studies are designed to mimic real-world clinical practice. Treatment decisions for ocrelizumab are independent from study participation; as such, these studies will recruit women who decide, along with their physicians, to continue their pregnancies despite potential in utero exposure (for MINORE); or to breastfeed while under ocrelizumab treatment (for SOPRANINO). MINORE is the first prospective study to measure placental transfer of any DMT in MS, and to perform comprehensive assessments in infants and mothers. Results may inform the optimal contraception period for women treated with ocrelizumab who are planning a pregnancy. Similarly, SOPRANINO is the first prospective study to measure pharmacodynamic effects of ocrelizumab in breastfed infants in addition to pharmacokinetic parameters in breastmilk. SOPRANINO may establish whether breastfeeding is safe for infants whose mothers received treatment with ocrelizumab.\nCONCLUSION: By collecting detailed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety information, MINORE and SOPRANINO will contribute to understanding the risk/benefit of ocrelizumab in pregnant and lactating women with MS."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the past decade, various breastfeeding policies were implemented in Hong Kong, including changes in perinatal guidelines in public hospitals, adoption of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), provision of guidelines for the marketing of formula milk, penalisation of discrimination towards breastfeeding, and extension of the statutory maternity leave. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges and opportunities to breastfeeding practices. Infection control measures in public hospitals included the cancellation of antenatal classes, hospital tours, and postnatal classes; suspension of perinatal visiting periods; and compulsory separation of COVID-19 positive mothers from newborns. In addition, work-from-home policies were widely implemented. This study aimed to identify the associated factors of six-month predominant breastfeeding (PBF), and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding practice.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted from 1 March 2021 to 7 April 2021 using a mixed-methods approach. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to members of breastfeeding or parenting groups who have had breastfeeding experience in the past 10 yrs. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with six-month PBF both in general and during the pandemic period. A qualitative content analysis was conducted using an inductive approach.\nRESULTS: The study included 793 participants. Giving birth in a public hospital (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.46, 3.34) and breastfeeding support from family and friends (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.05, 1.57) were significantly associated with six-month PBF, even during COVID-19. Factors associated with the self-rated impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding include working from home, the perceived immunological benefits of breastfeeding, and the wish to avoid breastfeeding or expressing breast milk in public premises. Furthermore, breastfeeding practice in public hospitals was more likely to be affected by the busyness of staff, while private hospitals had worse rooming-in practices and staff who had inadequate breastfeeding knowledge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Giving birth in a public hospital and having breastfeeding support from family and friends were associated with six-month PBF. Furthermore, COVID-19 in Hong Kong had an overall positive impact on six-month PBF. Further studies should investigate the impact of hospital practices and the COVID-19 pandemic on breastfeeding behaviours."

Evidence from other vaccine-preventable diseases suggests that maternal immunization can provide protection to infants, especially during the high-risk first 6 months of life, through passive transplacental antibody transfer (2). Recent studies of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy suggest the possibility of transplacental transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies that might provide protection to infants (3-5); however, no epidemiologic evidence currently exists for the protective benefits of maternal immunization during pregnancy against COVID-19 in infants. The Overcoming COVID-19 network conducted a test-negative, case-control study at 20 pediatric hospitals in 17 states during July 1, 2021-January 17, 2022, to assess effectiveness of maternal completion of a 2-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy against COVID-19 hospitalization in infants. Among 379 hospitalized infants aged &lt;6 months (176 with COVID-19 [case-infants] and 203 without COVID-19 [control-infants]), the median age was 2 months, 21% had at least one underlying medical condition, and 22% of case- and control-infants were born premature (&lt;37 weeks gestation). Effectiveness of maternal vaccination during pregnancy against COVID-19 hospitalization in infants aged &lt;6 months was 61% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a031%-78%).

Milk and breast swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and milk was tested for anti-RBD IgA.\nRESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any milk sample or on 71% of breast swabs. Twenty-seven out of 29 (93%) breast swabs collected after breast washing tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the breast was associated with maternal coughing and other household COVID-19. Most (75%; 95% CI, 70-79%; n=316) milk samples contained anti-RBD IgA, and concentrations increased (P=.02) during the first two weeks following onset of COVID-19 symptoms or positive test. Milk-borne anti-RBD IgA persisted for at least two months in 77% of women.\nCONCLUSION: Milk produced by women with COVID-19 does not contain SARS-CoV-2 and is likely a lasting source of passive immunity via anti-RBD IgA. These results support recommendations encouraging lactating women to continue breastfeeding during and after COVID-19 illness."

Ethnopharmacological research has relevance to global priorities on maternal and child health, to understanding origins and determinants of human self-medication, and for reconciling traditional postpartum practices and mainstream healthcare.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: Present emerging evidence, within evolutionary and socio-cultural contexts, on the role of maternal consumption on transfer of phytochemicals into breast milk with impacts on maternal and child health, and on infant development. Establish current state of knowledge and an ethnopharmacological research agenda that is attentive to cross-cultural and regional differences in postpartum plant use.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive literature review using Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science focused on traditional and contemporary use and socio-cultural context, as well as physiological, pharmacological, toxicological, and behavioral activities of plants used medicinally by women during postpartum recovery and lactation.\nRESULTS: The most widely reported postpartum plants show antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunological, and neurophysiological activities, with low toxicity. Phytochemicals transfer from maternal consumption into breast milk in physiological concentrations, while animal studies demonstrate immunomodulation and other actions of medicinal plants during lactation. Reporting on the use and diverse traditional knowledge of women about plants during the postpartum period is obscured by the marginal place of obstetric issues and by gender biases in ethnobotanical research. In many contemporary contexts use is prejudiced by precautionary risk warnings in health literature and practice that confound lactation with pregnancy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although systematic investigation of postpartum plant use is lacking, known pharmacological activities support potential benefits on infant development and maternal health with immediate and long-term consequences in relation to allergic, inflammatory, autoimmune, and other diseases. An ethnopharmacological agenda focused on the perinatal period requires directed methodologies and a regional approach in relation to culturally-specific knowledge and practices, traditional plant use, and local health needs. Testing the hypothesis that phytochemicals transferred from medicinal plants into breast milk impact the human immune system and other aspects of infant development requires extended analysis of phytochemicals in human milk and infant lumen and plasma, as well as effects on gastrointestinal and milk microbiome."

We enrolled 24 infants who were either exclusively breastfed or supplemented with formula by the age of one month. We collected diet information, stool samples for evaluation of microbiotas by 16S rRNA sequencing, and blood samples for assessment of immune development by flow cytometry from birth to 6 months of age. We further typed the Bifidobacterium strains in stool samples whose 16S rRNA sequencing showed the presence of Bifidobacteriaceae. Supplementation with formula during breastfeeding transiently changed the composition of the gut microbiome, but the impact dissipated by six months of age. For example, Bifidobacterium longum, a bacterial species highly correlated with human milk consumption, was found to be significantly different only at 1 month of age but not at later time points. No immunologic differences were found to be associated with supplementation, including the development of T-cell subsets, B cells, or monocytes. These data suggest that early formula supplementation, given in addition to breast milk, has minimal lasting impact on the gut microbiome or immunity."

Using RT-qPCR, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample (n\u2009=\u200937) collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis. Although we detected evidence of viral RNA on 8 out of 70 breast skin swabs, only one was considered a conclusive positive result. In contrast, 76% of the milk samples collected from women with COVID-19 contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, and 80% had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG. In addition, 62% of the milk samples were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro, whereas milk samples collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were unable to do so. Taken together, our data do not support mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a beneficial source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.IMPORTANCE Results from prior studies assaying human milk for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, have suggested milk may act as a potential vehicle for mother-to-child transmission. Most previous studies are limited because they followed only a few participants, were cross-sectional, and/or failed to report how milk was collected and/or analyzed. As such, considerable uncertainty remains regarding whether human milk is capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child. Here, we report that repeated milk samples collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis did not contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, we found that milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity.

We used flow cytometry to study the immune phenotype in neonatal and maternal blood samples and mixed lymphocyte reactions to establish the proliferation response of neonatal versus maternal lymphocytes and vice versa. The microbiome of neonatal stool samples was also investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing.\nRESULTS: We show that the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) increases in this period and is nearly twofold higher in exclusively breastfed neonates compared with those who received formula milk only. Moreover, breastfed neonates show a specific and Treg-dependent reduction in proliferative T-cell responses to non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA), associated with a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production. We also observed the enrichment of short chain fatty acid producing taxa (Veillonella and Gemella) in stool samples of exclusively breastfed neonates.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that exposure of the neonate to maternal cells through breastfeeding acts to drive the maturation of Tregs and 'tolerizes' the neonate towards NIMA."

Despite these widely recognized properties, breast-feeding represents an important mother-to-child transmission route of some viral infections. Different studies show that some flaviviruses can occasionally be detected in breast milk, but their transmission to the newborn is still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the antiviral activity of human milk (HM) in its different stages of maturation against two emerging flaviviruses, namely Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV) and to verify whether HM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) contribute to the milk protective effect. Colostrum, transitional and mature milk samples were collected from 39 healthy donors. The aqueous fractions were tested in vitro with specific antiviral assays and EVs and GAGs were derived and characterized. HM showed antiviral activity against ZIKV and USUV at all the stages of lactation with no significant differences in the activity of colostrum, transitional or mature milk. Mechanism of action studies demonstrated that colostrum does not inactivate viral particles, but it hampers the binding of both flaviviruses to cells. We also demonstrated that HM-EVs and HM-GAGs contribute, at least in part, to the anti-ZIKV and anti-USUV action of HM. This study discloses the intrinsic antiviral activity of HM against ZIKV and USUV and demonstrates the contribution of two bioactive components in mediating its protective effect. Since the potential infectivity of HM during ZIKV and USUV infection is still unclear, these data support the World Health Organization recommendations about breast-feeding during ZIKV infection and could contribute to producing new guidelines for a possible USUV epidemic."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to infant during breastfeeding, and if so whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk. This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.\nMETHODS: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.\nRESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness."

Understanding factors associated with timely initiation of breastfeeding is crucial for healthcare providers and policy-makers. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with early initiation of breastfeeding among mothers with children <\u200924\u2009months of age in the Kilimanjaro region, Northern Tanzania.\nMETHODS: This study utilized secondary data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in April 2016 and April 2017 in the Kilimanjaro region. A multistage sampling technique was used to select study participants and interviewed using a questionnaire. A total of 1644 women with children aged <\u200924\u2009months were analyzed. Modified Poisson regression models were used to determine factors independently associated with early initiation of breastfeeding, within first hour of life.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding in the Kilimanjaro region was 70%, ranging from 64% in Same to 80% in Siha districts. The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding was lower among women who initiated prelacteal feeding compared to their counterparts (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.42; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.34, 0.53). Likewise, women living in Same and Hai district had lower prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding compared to women in Rombo (PR 0.8; 95% CI 0.76, 0.93) and (PR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80, 0.98) respectively. Higher prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding was found in women with primary education compared to those with secondary education (PR 1.09; 95% CI 1.003, 1.18), and among women with two children compared to one child (PR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03, 1.26).\nCONCLUSIONS: Early initiation of breastfeeding practice was suboptimal in this study. To improve early initiation of breastfeeding, healthcare providers at reproductive and child health clinics and labour wards should discourage women from prelacteal feeding, give more support to women with one child and those with secondary level of education and above. Furthermore, a qualitative study is crucial to understand the reasons for low prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding in Same and Hai districts."

            "abstract": "Allergic disorders, characterized by Th2 immune responses to environmental substances, are increasingly common in children in Western societies. Multiple studies indicate that breastfeeding, early complementary introduction of food allergens, and antibiotic avoidance in the first year of life reduces allergic outcomes in at-risk children. Why the benefit of these practices is restricted to early life is largely unknown. We identified a preweaning interval during which dietary antigens are assimilated by the colonic immune system. This interval is under maternal control via temporal changes in breast milk, coincides with an influx of naive T cells into the colon, and is followed by the development of a long-lived population of colonic peripherally derived Tregs (pTregs) that can be specific for dietary antigens encountered during this interval. Desynchronization of mothers and offspring produced durable deficits in these pTregs, impaired tolerance to dietary antigens introduced during and after this preweaning interval, and resulted in spontaneous Th2 responses. These effects could be rescued by pTregs from the periweaning colon or by Tregs generated in vitro using periweaning colonic antigen-presenting cells. These findings demonstrate that mothers and their offspring are synchronized for the development of a balanced immune system."

Besides nutrition, it provides protection during the newborn's adaption to the extrauterine environment and reduces the morbidity and mortality caused by both infectious and noninfectious diseases. Its components act directly against infectious agents, but they also accelerate the newborn's immune system development, increasing its capacity for defense and reducing the risk of allergy and other immune-related diseases. Cytokines show the most refined immunomodulatory effects, but oligosaccharides, hormones, and other components affect the newborn's immunity as well. Furthermore, milk components substantially affect the microbial colonization of infant mucosa, which substantially influences the development of all parts of the immune system. All these components act primarily locally, on the mucosal membranes, preventing the penetration of microbes and other antigenic components into the circulation thus ensuring effective defense without the damaging inflammation. Human lacteal secretions contain a number of live cells. Although there are no major differences in the cytokine production between allergic and healthy mothers, they are able to respond to multiple stimuli. By increasing happiness, boosting protective immunity, and decreasing the risk of breast cancer, breastfeeding may have multiple benefits for the mother as well."

Our goal was to determine whether breastfeeding truly provides protection against APNs, while investigating the effects of other factors such as sex, age, mode of delivery, and birth weight on APN.\nMETHODS: A total of 62 infants under 6 months of age who had both microbiologically and radiologically-confirmed APN were enrolled in the case group. Healthy infants (n = 178) who visited the hospital for scheduled vaccinations were enrolled in the control group. The following participant characteristics were compared between the case and control groups: age, sex, birth order among siblings, feeding methods, weight percentile by month, birth weight percentile by gestational age, gestational age at birth, and mode of delivery.\nRESULTS: Babies exclusively fed with manufactured infant formulae before 6 months of age had significantly higher risk for APN than breastfed or mixed-fed infants (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.687-7.031; P = 0.001). Firstborn babies had lower risk for APN than 2nd- or 3rd-born babies (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.210-0.919). Other factors that increased the risk for APN were low birth weight percentiles (OR, 8.33; 95% CI, 2.300-30.166) and birth via caesarean section (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.097-4.887). There were more preterm births in the case group (10.9% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.002), but this did not increase the risk for APN (OR, 4.47; P = 0.063).\nCONCLUSION: Feeding exclusively with formula before 6 months of age was related to higher risk for APN, which demonstrates that breastfeeding has a protective effect against APN. The other risk factors for APN were birth order (\u2265 2nd-born), low birth weight, and birth via caesarean section."

First-line conservative treatment consists of a chest tube drainage and a fat-free and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-enriched diet. This typically leads to a discontinuity of breast milk feeding due to high content of long-chain triglycerides within the breast milk. Modified breast milk with low fat content (LFBM) could provide numerous benefits like immunological properties of breast milk even for patients with chylothorax. This study was conducted at Herzzentrum Leipzig comparing clinical and growth outcomes between infants with chylothorax after surgery for congenital heart disease treated with LFBM (n\u2009=\u200913) versus MCT-Formula (n\u2009=\u200910). LFBM was prepared by centrifugation of native breast milk added with MCT-oil and fortifier. There were no differences in volume and duration of chest tube drainage between LFBM and MCT-formula treatment groups. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences with regard to weight and length gains could be observed between both feeding groups. LFBM is an efficient and unharmful treatment for chylothorax following cardiac surgery in young children."

Serial breast milk samples were collected before infusion and at 8 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 18-21 days after rituximab infusion in 4 patients. Five additional patients provided 1-2 samples at various times after rituximab infusion.\nRESULTS: The median average rituximab concentration in mature breast milk was low at 0.063 \u03bcg/mL (range 0.046-0.097) in the 4 patients with serial breast milk collection, with an estimated median absolute infant dose of 0.0094 mg/kg/d and a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.08% (range 0.06%-0.10%). Most patients had a maximum concentration at 1-7 days after infusion. The maximum concentration occurred in a woman with a single breast milk sample and was 0.29 \u03bcg/mL at 11 days postinfusion, which corresponds with an estimated RID of 0.33%. Rituximab concentration in milk was virtually undetectable by 90 days postinfusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: We determined minimal transfer of rituximab into mature breast milk. The RID for rituximab was less than 0.4% and well below theoretically acceptable levels of less than 10%. Low oral bioavailability would probably also limit the absorption of rituximab by the newborn. In women with serious autoimmune neurologic conditions, monoclonal antibody therapy may afford an acceptable benefit to risk ratio, supporting both maternal treatment and breastfeeding."

We assessed general stress, postpartum-specific stress, negative affectivity, salivary cortisol of mother, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) levels of breast milk 4-6 weeks after delivery. Controlling for the effects of women's age, weight, number, and duration of feedings, postpartum-specific stress was related to reduced sIgA concentration (R2 = .206, beta = -.275, p = .020). This study suggests that the established link between psychological stress and immunity may also extend to the immunity of the newborn by reducing the immunological benefits of breast milk. It also suggests that breastfeeding might be a potential mechanism of the relationship between maternal stress and the health of the offspring. Findings highlight the need for interventions addressing women during the postpartum period, in order to ensure the mother's well-being and the infant's optimal development."

Although the influence of breast feeding on motor development during childhood has been studied, the findings are inconsistent, and some studies have even reported no effect. This manuscript presents a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis, with the aim of reviewing the relationship between breast feeding and motor skill development in children in terms of duration, exclusivity or non-exclusivity of breast feeding.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The search will be conducted using Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2019. Observational studies (cross-sectional and follow-up studies) written in English or Spanish that investigate the association between breast feeding and motor development in children will be included. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. The Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies and The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for longitudinal studies will be used to assess the quality of included studies. The effect of breast feeding on motor skill development will be calculated as the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses will be carried out based on the characteristics of motor skill development and the population included.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because the data used will be obtained from published studies, and there will be no concerns about privacy. The findings from this study will be relevant information regarding the association of breast feeding with motor development in children and could be used encourage to improve breastfeeding rates. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018093706."

            "abstract": "Introduction: Congenital chylothorax (CC) is a rare and life-threating condition. Since its treatment is founded on the elimination of long-chain fatty acids from the diet, breastfeeding has been traditionally contraindicated. However, breast milk could be very beneficial due to its immunological and nutritional benefits. Only limited research has been published about the usage of modified-fat breast milk (MBM) in chylothorax treatment. Methods and Results: Systematic review methods were used by two independent reviewers. Only a few case report studies (quality assessment on the domains of the GRADE approach), two small controlled studies, a retrospective study, and some test-tube-based laboratory research met the inclusion criteria. Despite this, we have observed a widespread clinical adoption of this novel treatment in health institutions. Data suggest that modified-fat breast milk does facilitate the resolution of chylothoraces. Refrigerated centrifuge (2\u00b0C, 3,000\u2009rpm for 15 minutes) and syringe fat removal methods were the most efficient options in terms of fat reduction. Conclusions: Feeding of human milk is advisable in CC and feasible by means of a simple milk defatting procedure. Open questions remain, related to length and degree of fat restriction and need for individualized fortification of defatted breast milk."

We explored (a) impact of formula supplementation on the likelihood of developing cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) and (b) current practice of formula supplementation (<24\u00a0hours) among mothers intending to breastfeed.\nMETHOD: Fifty-five CMPA-diagnosed children, fed at <24\u00a0hours of age (breast only, formula only or breast with formula supplementation), were recruited, and 55 milk-tolerant age- and sex-matched controls were identified retrospectively in Cork University Maternity Hospital. Two logistic regressions (LoR) examined neonatal feed types on likelihood of developing CMPA while controlling for parental atopy and infant sex. Formula supplementation was then prospectively measured among a separate group of 179 breastfeeding mothers. Linear regression (LiR) analysis was used to examine the subjective and objective reasons for formula supplementation, in addition to examining pre-existing factors.\nRESULTS: Two LoR examined the infant groups: exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or breastfed with formula supplementation. The first LoR model which showed only formula supplementation was significant in prediction of development of CMPA (\u03c72 (3)\u00a0=\u00a025.74, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05), with 74% diagnostic accuracy when parental atopy and infant sex were controlled for. Breastfed infants given formula supplements were 7.03 (95% CI, 1.82-27.25) times more likely to exhibit CMPA than those who were exclusively breastfed. Formula supplementation was significant (OR 16.62, 95% CI 3.89-71.11), indicating that breastfed infants who were given formula supplements were 16 times more likely to exhibit CMPA than those who were exclusively bottle-fed. Exclusively formula-fed infants (odds ratio 0.42, 95% CI, 0.16-1.07) were not significantly more likely to exhibit CMPA than those who were exclusively breastfed in either model (P\u00a0&gt;\u00a0.05). About 45.8% of breastfed infants (&lt;24\u00a0hours) received supplemental formula. LiR investigated importance of the subjective and objective reasons, in predicting formula supplementation. This model was significant F(8,170)\u00a0=\u00a066.95, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05) explaining 75% of total variance. The subjective factors 'no latch' and 'mum unwell' were the strongest predictors (\u03b2\u00a0&gt;\u00a0.45). Objective factors and pre-existing factors had lower \u00df values with only mode of delivery and infant hypoglycaemia being significant.\nCONCLUSION: Breastfed babies are still being put at significantly increased risk of CMPA by receiving supplemental formula in the first 24\u00a0hours of life, despite the major predictors of supplementation being subjective and remediable in other ways. Mothers and healthcare providers should be better educated on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and resourced adequately to avoid unnecessary formula supplementation to reduce risk of development of CMPA."

Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first six months of life, but this recommendation is poorly adhered to in many parts of the world, including the Middle-East region, putting infants at risk of developing allergic sensitization and disorders. When breastfeeding is not possible or not adequate, a partially hydrolyzed whey formula (pHF-W) has shown proven benefits of preventing allergy, mainly atopic eczema, in children with a genetic risk. Therefore, besides stimulating breastfeeding, early identification of infants at risk for developing atopic disease and replacing commonly used formula based on intact cow milk protein (CMP) with a clinically proven pHF-W formula is of paramount importance for allergy prevention. If the child is affected by cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), expert guidelines recommend extensively hydrolyzed formula (eHF), or an amino acid formula (AAF) in case of severe symptoms. The Middle-East region has a unique practice of utilizing pHF-W as a step-down between eHF or AAF and intact CMP, which could be of benefit. The region is very heterogeneous with different levels of clinical practice, and as allergic disorders may be seen by healthcare professionals of different specialties with different levels of expertise, there is a great variability in preventive and treatment approaches within the region itself. During a consensus meeting, a new approach was discussed and unanimously approved by all participants, introducing the use of pHF-W in the therapeutic management of CMPA. This novel approach could be of worldwide benefit."

Amidst a myriad of contextual factors, current breastfeeding rates are below globally targeted goals. For premature and/or critically ill infants, the importance of receiving breast milk is often encouraged based on its immunological and nutritive benefits as opposed to the entirety of the breastfeeding interaction, underscoring the influence of dualism in the NICU.\nDESIGN: The impact of Cartesian dualism and other sociocultural underpinnings of breastfeeding focused within the NICU environment are illustrated through a critical, philosophical discussion.\nMETHODS: Relevant historical context is provided followed by an overview of the realities of contemporary breastfeeding. These are presented as a frame of reference for the NICU breastfeeding experiences currently encountered by many mothers of preterm and critically ill neonates, further illustrated using a clinical exemplar as well as the author's own observations from neonatal nursing practice.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Shifting away from a dualistic approach requires rethinking breastfeeding support interactions between NICU nurses and mothers. To address the disembodied and often mechanistic approach to care inherent in the dominant Western medical model, a relational approach to breastfeeding support in the NICU is suggested and discussed.\nCONCLUSION: Future research from a more critical lens is needed to examine the complex dynamics involved when nurses and mothers are negotiating decisions and processes related to infant feeding. In focusing on the relational dimensions of the breastfeeding experience, nurses can resist the dualistic influence and dominant discourses impacting infant feeding and motherhood in the 21st century."

It is characterized by an allergic reaction to one or more cow's milk proteins. There are not pathog nomonic clinical symptoms, and these will depend on the type of immune reaction involved. A good diagnostic approach avoids under and over diagnosis and, therefore, under and over treatment. The CMPA treatment is the elimination of cow's milk protein from the diet. A restricted diet in a child does not require it or who has developed tolerance can alter growth, quality of life, including unne cessary costs. The objective of this review is to present the different milk formulas available in Chile to treat CMPA in those cases where breastfeeding with exclusion diet is not possible. For this purpose, nutritional composition, ingredients and other relevant characteristics of all the milk formulas and juices marketed in Chile as CMPA treatment were reviewed. The information was obtained from the official distributors or sellers or failing that, from the official websites. There are multiple milk formulas and beverages used for the treatment of CMPA, and not all of them are nutritionally or immunologically secure.

New mother have been encouraged to exclusively breastfeed by health care professionals and consumer-advocacy forums for years, citing \"breast milk is the perfect food\". The benefits are numerous and include psychological, convenience, economical, ecological and nutritionally superior. Human milk is a composite of nutritional choices of the mother, commencing in the pre-conceptual era. Events influencing the eventual nutritional profile of breast milk for the neonate start with pre-conceptual dietary habits through pregnancy and finally to postpartum. Food choices do affect the nutritional profile of human breast milk. It is not known who coined the phrase \"breast milk is the perfect food\" but it is widely prevalent in the literature. While breast milk is highly nutritive, containing important immunological and growth factors, scientific investigation reveals a few short-falls. Overall, human breast milk has been found to be low in certain nutrients in developed countries: vitamin D, iodine, iron, and vitamin K. Additional nutrient deficiencies have been documented in resource-poor countries: vitamin A, vitamin B 12, zinc, and vitamin B 1/thiamin. Given these findings, isn't it more accurate to describe breast milk as \"conditionally perfect\"? Correcting the impression that breast milk is an inherently, automatically comprehensive enriched product would encourage women who plan to breastfeed an opportunity to concentrate on dietary improvement to optimizes nutrient benefits ultimately to the neonate. The more immediate result would improve pre-conceptual nutritional status. Here, we explore the nutritional status of groups of young women; some of whom will become pregnant and eventually produce breast milk. We will review the available literature profiling vitamin, mineral, protein and caloric content of breast milk. We highlight pre-existing situations needing correction to optimize conception and fetal development. While alternative forms of infant nutrition carry standard product labels of nutrient adequacy, this information does not apply universally to all breast milk. Infant formulas are fortified with various amounts of vitamins, minerals, supplemental protein concentrates, nucleic factors, omega 3 fatty acids and any important new nutritional finding. Infant formulas are manufactured to be consistent in composition and are monitored closely for quality. Not true for human breast milk. Any nutrient deficiency existing in pregnancy will ultimately be carried forward via lactation. It is a biological impossibility for a lactating woman to transfer nutrients via breast milk she does not have!"

            "abstract": "Initiating breastfeeding within the first hour of life confers an important benefit in terms of child mortality and severe morbidity. Intestinal permeability to ingested macromolecules and immunoglobulins is limited to the first days of human life. These exchanges cease in the very early post-partum period but may increase beyond the neonatal period in response to local inflammation or introduction of a weaning food. From animal- and limited human-based observations, compelling evidence points out to breastmilk cells also trafficking from mother to infant mucosal tissues and participating to the maternal microchimerism. The precise nature of breastmilk cells that are involved is presently not known but likely includes progenitor/stem cells-representing up to 6% of breastmilk cells-with possible contribution of mature immune cells. Stem cell microchimerism may induce tolerance to non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMAs), breastfeeding generating regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub> ) that suppress antimaternal immunity. Therefore, in complement to pregnancy-induced microchimerism, breastfeeding-induced microchimerism may be pivotal in infant immune development, intestinal tissue repair/growth and protection against infectious diseases. As a continuum of the gestational period, the neonatal gut may be considered as a temporary, but important developmental extension of the role played by the placenta during intrauterine life; breastmilk playing the role of maternal blood by delivering maternal soluble factors (macromolecules, Ig, cytokines) and immunologically active milk cells. A better understanding of breastfeeding-induced maternal microchimerism would provide further evidence in support of public health messages that reinforce the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding."

            "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of childhood asthma has been increasing considerably, and the protection afforded by breastfeeding in its development has been the subject of controversy for more than 80 years. Previous systematic reviews have generally found a protective effect of breastfeeding on allergic outcomes, although many studies have methodological limitations. Although breastfeeding is protective against lower respiratory tract infection during infancy, such protection has not been demonstrated for asthma in all studies. Breastfeeding has health benefits for the mother and child. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of an infant's life, with continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or longer, is recognized as the \"gold\" standard for infant feeding because human milk is uniquely suited to the human infant, and its nutritional content and bioactivity promote a healthy development. There is increasing concern that the practice of delaying complementary foods until 6 months may exacerbate the risk of allergic disease. Breast milk contains immunological components that protect against infections and allergic disease in infancy. The composition of human breast milk is complex, containing factors that interact with the infant immune system and intestinal milieu including allergens, cytokines, immunoglobulins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and chemokines. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 is a cytokine in human milk involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, inflammation regulation, and oral tolerance development. Modern day society, with increased standards of hygiene, has changed the gut flora of Western infants, potentially impacting the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases including allergic disease and asthma. Microbial diversity is intrinsic to healthy immune maturation and function. Compared to breastfed infants, formula-fed infants had lower bacterial diversity and an altered intestinal microbiota in the first few weeks of life associated with an increased risk of eczema and asthma. Favorable gut colonization through continued breastfeeding may promote tolerance as well as protection when complementary feeding is initiated."

Human milk provides a variety of immune protective and immune maturation factors that are beneficial to the preterm infant's poorly developed immune system. The most studied immune components in human milk include antimicrobial proteins, maternal leukocytes, immunoglobulins, cytokines and chemokines, oligosaccharides, gangliosides, nucleotides, and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. There is growing evidence that these components contribute to the lower incidence of immune-related conditions in the preterm infant. Therefore, provision of these components in human milk, donor milk, or formula may provide immunologic benefits."

The pregnant woman has an altered immune response and, for some pathologies, is at increased risk of infection and of developing complications and serious outcomes. In addition, maternal infections can result in congenital anomalies, malformations or severe neonatal diseases. Vaccination of pregnant women can therefore have a double goal: to protect the mother from diseases that could have an impact on her health and to avoid infection/disease transmission to the fetus or the newborn. Despite the potential benefits of immunization in pregnant women, it is still evident reluctance and/or refusal of vaccinations by health professionals as well as by pregnant women, who are wary of the real advantages linked to vaccines. For these reasons a group of experts has evaluated the latest scientific evidence reported in the international literature on this relevant topic."

Young children (before the age of six months) are the demographic group most exposed to recommended/mandatory vaccines preserved with Thimerosal and its metabolite ethylmercury (EtHg). Particularly in the less-developed countries, newborns, neonates, and young children are exposed to EtHg because it is still in several of their pediatric vaccines and mothers are often immunized with Thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) during pregnancy. While the immunogenic component of the product has undergone more rigorous testing, Thimerosal, known to have neurotoxic effects even at low doses, has not been scrutinized for the limit of tolerance alone or in combination with adjuvant-Al during immaturity or developmental periods (pregnant women, newborns, infants, and young children). Scientific evidence has shown the potential hazards of Thimerosal in experiments that modeled vaccine-EtHg concentrations. Observational population studies have revealed uncertainties related to neurological effects. However, consistently, they showed a link of EtHg with risk of certain neurodevelopment disorders, such as tic disorder, while clearly revealing the benefits of removing Thimerosal from children's vaccines (associated with immunological reactions) in developed countries. So far, only rich countries have benefited from withdrawing the risk of exposing young children to EtHg. Regarding Thimerosal administered to the very young, we have sufficient studies that characterize a state of uncertainty: the collective evidence strongly suggests that Thimerosal exposure is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is claimed that the continued use of Thimerosal in the less-developed countries is due to the cost to change to another preservative, such as 2-phenoxyethanol. However, the estimated cost increase per child in the first year of life is lower than estimated lifetime cost of caring for a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder, such tic disorder. The evidence indicates that Thimerosal-free vaccine options should be made available in developing countries."

            "abstract": "Own mother's milk is the first choice in feeding preterm infants and provides multiple short- and long-term benefits. When it is unavailable, donor human milk is recommended as the first alternative. Donor milk undergoes processing (i.e. pasteurization) to reduce bacteriological and viral contaminants but influences its bioactive properties with potentially fewer benefits than raw milk. However, there is no clinical evidence of health benefit of raw compared to pasteurized human milk, and donor milk maintains documented advantages compared to formula. Nutrient content of donor and own mother's milk fails to meet the requirements of preterm infants. Adequate fortification is necessary to provide optimal growth. There are significant challenges in providing donor milk for premature infants; therefore, specific clinical guidelines for human milk banks and donor milk use in the neonatal intensive care unit should be applied and research should focus on innovative solutions to process human milk while preserving its immunological and nutritional components. In addition, milk banks are not the only instrument to collect, process and store donor milk but represent an excellent tool for breastfeeding promotion."

Breastmilk samples were collected at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of lactation for the measurement of ovalbumin. The permeability of the mammary epithelium was assessed by measuring the breastmilk sodium : potassium ratio. Egg-specific IgE and IgG4 were measured in infant plasma at 6 weeks, and prior to the introduction of egg in solids at 16 weeks.\nRESULTS: Average maternal egg ingestion was associated with breastmilk ovalbumin concentration. Specifically, for each additional egg ingested per week, there was an average 25% increase in ovalbumin concentration (95% CI: 5-48%, P = 0.01). Breastmilk ovalbumin concentrations were significantly higher in the 'high-egg' group (> 4 eggs per week) compared with the 'egg-free' group (P = 0.04). However, one-third of women had no breastmilk ovalbumin detected. No detectable associations were found between mammary epithelium permeability and breastmilk ovalbumin concentrations. Infant plasma egg-specific IgG4 levels were also positively associated with maternal egg ingestion, with an average 22% (95% CI: 3-45%) increase in infant egg-specific IgG4 levels per additional egg consumed per week (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased maternal egg ingestion is associated with increased breastmilk ovalbumin, and markers of immune tolerance in infants. These results highlight the potential for maternal diet to benefit infant oral tolerance development during lactation."

We propose that maternal milk composition has not adapted to the needs of allergy prevention because of the recent and rapid increase of allergy. Modulation of breast milk composition may be the best strategy to counteract allergy development. We will review recent advances in understanding of allergy physiopathology and how breast milk factors may be specifically appropriate to interfere with allergy development in early life.\nRECENT FINDINGS: There is strong evidence both from rodent and human studies that breast milk factors may impact on parameters which are now recognized to be essential for allergy physiopathology: infant gut barrier function, microbiota metabolites production, and oral tolerance induction. Data from human cohorts support the possibility to modify breast milk composition by selected interventions and to impact health outcomes in offspring.\nSUMMARY: Nutritional intervention in lactating mothers should endow breast milk with the capacity to combat allergy epidemics in addition to infectious disease."

Limited immunological functions of newborns are supported and altered by the immunological elements of mother milk. Chemokines are of importance among these immune factors. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been demonstrated in mother's milk, and its receptors, CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR)-1 and CXCR-2, were detected on cells, responsible for immunological reactions and mammary glandular cells. The soluble forms of these receptors are yet to be described in human milk. In this study, it was aimed to assess the IL-8 levels and the concentrations of its receptors in colostrum and mature mother's milk in regard to preterm and term delivery. The results of this study indicated a decline in IL-8 levels with the lactation stage, but no difference was observed between term and preterm mother's milk. Regarding the CXCR-1 and CXCR-2, the concentrations of these receptors were similar in both colostrum and mature milk. Furthermore, there was not any significant difference between term and preterm mother's milk. In conclusion, this is the first study to investigate the concentrations of CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 with the levels of IL-8 in colostrum and mature human milk of term and preterm newborns. The alterations in IL-8 levels were similar in some of the studies reported. CXCR-1 and CXCR-2 levels did not demonstrate any significant difference. Further studies are required to investigate the soluble forms of these receptors and their relation to IL-8 with larger cohort."

Of the 735 mother-infant pairs, a total of 310 (42.2%) reported early initiation. Mothers who were assisted by traditional attendants during childbirth, delivered by caesarean section, from ethnically disadvantaged families and had delivered low birth weight infants, were less likely to initiate breastfeeding early whereas the mothers who were from the poorest families and did not introduce prelacteal feeds to their infants were more likely to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour.

Colostrum samples were obtained from 98 lactating mothers. Stool samples were collected from 108 infants within 5 days after birth and at 2 and 4 months of age. We compared concentrations of sIgA, IL-8, and sCD14 in colostrum between mothers with and without a history of allergic disease and allergic sensitization. We also compared fecal sIgA levels between breastfed and formula-fed infants and between infants with allergic and nonallergic mothers.\nRESULTS: The sIgA concentrations were significantly higher in colostrum from allergic mothers than from nonallergic mothers (P = .01) and from allergic mothers who were immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitized compared to nonallergic mothers who were not IgE sensitized (P = .023). Breastfed infants had significantly higher fecal sIgA levels as compared to formula-fed infants, regardless of whether their lactating mothers had an allergy (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: We found that breastfeeding is associated with increased infants' fecal sIgA levels and may have potential protective effects to the infants during the first 4 months of life, regardless of whether their lactating mothers have allergies."

In the first 5 years post-treatment, routine history and physical and computed tomography (CT) imaging (more frequent in the first 2 years) are generally appropriate. However, there are limited data to support the role of positron emission tomography scanning as routine follow-up. Beyond 5 years post-treatment, annual history and physical is appropriate, although there is no longer a role for routine imaging for recurrences. Women irradiated to the chest area at a young age (<35) would benefit from annual mammogram screening given the increased breast cancer risk. Magnetic resonance imaging can be considered, although there is a lack of data supporting its role in this population. Low-dose chest CT for lung cancer screening in patients with history of mediastinal irradiation and/or alkylating chemotherapy exposures and a smoking history can be considered, although data on its utility is lacking. Cardiac screening with echocardiogram and exercise tolerance tests in patients with history of mediastinal irradiation and/or adriamycin exposure may be appropriate, although the optimal screening interval would depend on mediastinal dose, adriamycin dose, presence of other cardiac risk factors and findings at the baseline screening.

DESIGN: Three-arm parallel-group randomized experiment. METHODS: We recruited people with acute LBP (pain for \u22646 weeks) to participate in an online experiment. Participants were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: guideline advice alone or guideline advice with the addition of brief pain science or ergonomics messages. The intervention was delivered via prerecorded videos in all 3 groups. Coprimary outcomes were reassurance that (1) no serious condition is causing LBP and (2) continuing with daily activities is safe. Secondary outcomes were perceived risk of developing chronic pain, management intentions (bed rest, see a health professional, see a specialist, and imaging), credibility, and relevance of the advice in addressing the participant's concerns. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred ninety-seven responses (99.3% of 2,313 randomized) were analyzed. Adding brief pain science or ergonomics messages to guideline advice did not change reassurance that LBP was not caused by serious disease. The addition of ergonomics advice provided worse reassurance that it is safe to continue with daily activities compared to guideline advice (mean difference [MD], -0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.53).

The challenge is to improve low back pain and activities of daily living performance earlier and prevent post-infection sequelae, and conservative treatment with antibiotics is the mainstay of treatment.\nMETHODS: In the present study, patients who were unable to walk following lumbar pyogenic spondylitis even in the subacute phase after successful infection control, showing bone defects expanding from endplate to vertebral body in CT, were treated with posterior percutaneous short-range instrumentation and anterior autogenous bone grafting (group S, n = 10) or with conservative treatment alone (group C, n = 10). Acute cases of absolute surgical indication with paralytic symptoms and mild cases who could walk by antibiotics administration were excluded. The two groups were compared regarding the post-treatment change in C-reactive protein level, duration of bed rest, and post-infection local spinal deformities (local scoliosis angle in the coronal plane and local kyphosis angle in the sagittal plane).\nRESULTS: Compared with group C, group S took a significantly shorter time for the C-reactive protein level to return to normal and required a significantly shorter duration of bed rest. Furthermore, surgery prevented the formation of kyphosis and scoliosis, while group C developed local kyphosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive surgical method of posterior percutaneous short-range instrumentation and anterior autogenous bone grafting effectively enables early control of pain and maintenance of locomotive function and prevents spinal deformity in patients with lumbar pyogenic spondylitis in the subacute phase with advanced vertebral bone destruction."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Back pain has many causes. In Germany, about 70% of adults have at least one episode of back pain per year.\nMETHODS: This review is based on a selective literature search and on the German National Disease Management Guideline for Low Back Pain.\nRESULTS: The physician taking the history from a patient with back pain should ask about the nature, onset, course, localization, and radiation of the pain and its dependence on physical activity and/or emotional stress. In the differential diagnosis, neurologic deficits and any \"red flags\" suggesting dangerous conditions such as spinal fracture, bacterial infection, and tumors must be ruled out. If no specific cause of the pain can be identified, no imaging studies are indicated on initial presentation. The treatment of acute, nonspecific low back pain focuses on pain relief and functional improvement. Adequate patient education and counseling are essential. Exercise therapy is no more effective than the continuation of normal daily activities. Restriction of activity, including bed rest, is of no benefit and merely prolongs recovery and the resumption of normal activity. Further diagnostic testing is indicated if there is any suspicion of a fracture, infection, or tumor.\nCONCLUSION: After dangerous conditions have been ruled out, low back pain can be pragmatically classified as either nonspecific or specific. More research is needed so that the diagnostic assessment and individualized treatment of acute lower back pain can be further refined."

Data on pain, activity/participation and adverse events were extracted. Methodological quality and quality of evidence were assessed with the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale (score range 0-10) and the GRADE criteria, respectively.\nRESULTS: Five RCTs (total n = 350) were identified including one placebo-controlled and four controlled trials examining analgesics (2 studies) and orthoses (3). PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 7. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to low. In two trials, spinal orthoses provided significantly higher medium-term pain relief [pooled standardized mean differences (SMD): -1.47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) -1.82, -1.13; I (2) = 0 %] and disability reduction (pooled SMD: -1.73, 95 % CI -2.09, -1.37; I (2) = 0 %) than no intervention. Immediate- and short-term pain effects of diclofenac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and tramadol (a strong opioid) were demonstrated when compared to a Chinese medicine, whereas non-significant effects were found for oxycodone and tapentadol (strong opioids) in a placebo-controlled trial. Low/insufficient statistical power, co-interventions and potential conflict of interest might have influenced the results.\nCONCLUSIONS: At present, there is insufficient evidence to inform conservative care for acute pain related to VCF. Large, multinational, placebo/sham-controlled trials to address this gap in evidence are needed."

            "abstract": "Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal symptom in pregnancy that can present as lumbar pain or pelvic girdle pain, with significant physical and psychosocial implications. Pelvic girdle pain is more prevalent and results in greater disability than lumbar pain. It is possible to distinguish between these two conditions from a detailed history based on the site of the pain, its intensity, disability and pain provocation tests. Management of low back pain in pregnancy is conservative, with physical exercise for lumbar pain and minimising activities that exacerbate pain, analgesics and bed rest for pelvic girdle pain, as well as avoiding abduction beyond the pain-free zone in labour. There is evidence that stabilising exercises in patients with pelvic girdle pain postpartum have a beneficial effect. Other treatment modalities that have been shown to be safe and effective include pelvic belts, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, spinal manipulative therapy, acupuncture and complementary therapy with yoga. Other orthopaedic complications in pregnancy such as carpal tunnel syndrome, pubic symphysis rupture, transient osteoporosis and osteonecrosis are usually self-limiting with a satisfactory outcome. However, a lack of awareness and failure to recognise these complications can result in long-term morbidity. Knowledge of the preoperative diagnostic investigations, surgical approaches and intraoperative positioning of the mother to avoid gravid uterus compression is vital in orthopaedic emergencies such as lumbar disc herniation, cauda equina syndrome, fractures and acute compartment syndrome of the lower limb to ensure a safe maternal and fetal outcome and to prevent serious disability. Pregnancy is not contraindicated in women with pre-existing orthopaedic complications such as kyphoscoliosis and total hip arthroplasty as there is no evidence to suggest increased maternal or fetal risks."

Searches were conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, AMED, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO for eligible randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome measure was pain. Eligible controls included placebo, no treatment, or usual care. Two reviewers extracted data and rated study quality. A random effects model was used to pool trial effects with the overall strength of evidence described using the GRADE criteria. Thirteen randomized controlled trials (2,847 participants) evaluating advice, bed rest, simple analgesics (paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), heat application, and a topical rubefacient were included. There was low-quality evidence that bed rest is ineffective and very-low-quality evidence that advice is ineffective in the short, intermediate, and long terms. There was very-low-quality evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and diclofenac \"when required\" dosing) provide an immediate analgesic effect (mean differences -10.9 [95% confidence interval = -17.6 to -4.2] and -11.3 [95% confidence interval = -17.8 to -4.9], respectively). There is very-low-quality evidence that heat wrap and a capsicum-based rubefacient provide an immediate analgesic effect (mean differences -13.5 [95% confidence interval = -21.3 to -5.7] and 17.5, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, respectively), but there was no information on longer-term outcomes.\nPERSPECTIVE: There is limited evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, heat wrap, and rubefacients provide immediate pain relief for acute back pain and that bed rest and advice are both ineffective.

Comparison treatments were classified into the following seven categories: sham, conventional general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, back school, or a collection of therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful (traction, corset, bed rest, home care, topical gel, no treatment, diathermy, and minimal massage).\nMAIN RESULTS: Thirty-nine RCTs were identified. Meta-regression models were developed for acute or chronic pain and short-term and long-term pain and function. For patients with acute low-back pain, spinal manipulative therapy was superior only to sham therapy (10-mm difference [95% CI, 2 to 17 mm] on a 100-mm visual analogue scale) or therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful. Spinal manipulative therapy had no statistically or clinically significant advantage over general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, or back school.

            "abstract": "Acute low back pain is one of the most common reasons for adults to see a family physician. Although most patients recover quickly with minimal treatment, proper evaluation is imperative to identify rare cases of serious underlying pathology. Certain red flags should prompt aggressive treatment or referral to a spine specialist, whereas others are less concerning. Serious red flags include significant trauma related to age (i.e., injury related to a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash in a young patient, or from a minor fall or heavy lifting in a patient with osteoporosis or possible osteoporosis), major or progressive motor or sensory deficit, new-onset bowel or bladder incontinence or urinary retention, loss of anal sphincter tone, saddle anesthesia, history of cancer metastatic to bone, and suspected spinal infection. Without clinical signs of serious pathology, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing often are not required. Although there are numerous treatments for nonspecific acute low back pain, most have little evidence of benefit. Patient education and medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants are beneficial. Bed rest should be avoided if possible. Exercises directed by a physical therapist, such as the McKenzie method and spine stabilization exercises, may decrease recurrent pain and need for health care services. Spinal manipulation and chiropractic techniques are no more effective than established medical treatments, and adding them to established treatments does not improve outcomes. No substantial benefit has been shown with oral steroids, acupuncture, massage, traction, lumbar supports, or regular exercise programs."

Acute low back pain can be self-limiting; however, 1 year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute low back pain has a high recurrence rate; 75% of those with a first episode have a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time.\nMETHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments for acute low back pain?

            "abstract": "Vertebral compression fractures represent a frequent pathology among elderly population, with potentially devastating consequences. More than 20\u00a0years have passed since percutaneous vertebroplasty was initially used in the treatment of angiomas, representing nowadays a widely used treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The authors present a retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients (in total 94 fractured levels) that underwent polymethylmethacrylate percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to senile or secondary osteoporosis. All fractures were free from neurologic involvement and were classified as A1 type according to Magerl classification. All of patients were initially treated conservatively, by application of orthosis that allows immediate deambulation. At control, patients who complained of pain and limitation of daily activities underwent MRI. If presence of marrow signal changes, especially hypertense signal in T2-weighted images was confirmed, percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure was performed (we could call it \"sub-acute\" procedure). A limited group of patients that did not tolerate brace and had an insufficient pain control underwent vertebroplasty \"in acute\", few days after fracture. Immediate post-operative pain reduction and follow-up clinical outcome (estimating quality of life and residual back pain) were evaluated by means of Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index. In the immediate post-operative course a significant pain relief was found in 39 patients (66.1%), moderate pain relief in 17 (28.8%), while 3 (5.1%) did not achieve relevant pain improvement. Pain intensity and life quality was maintained within satisfactory limits after a mean follow-up of 16\u00a0months. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective and safe procedure for treating vertebral compression fractures in the elderly. It provides immediate pain relief and allows early mobilization, thus avoiding potentially severe complications related to persistent back pain and prolonged bed rest. When performed by experienced surgeon complication rate is low, representing a safe procedure, able to provide a satisfactory outcome."

Furthermore, higher levels of physical activity in critically ill patients have been assumed to be impractical or not feasible. Bed rest has been prescribed in the past for several other clinical conditions including acute flares of rheumatoid arthritis, cavitary tuberculosis, acute myocardial infarction, and acute low back pain. However, randomized, controlled, clinical trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of bed rest in most of these conditions. Bed rest can cause several complications that may delay or prevent recovery from critical illnesses including disuse muscle atrophy, joint contractures, thromboembolic disease, and insulin resistance. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility and safety of physical medicine programs in critically ill patients including those with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Other physical medicine tools, such as neuromuscular electrical stimulation and passive stretching of muscles, may also reduce some complications of bed rest."

Consider McKenzie exercises, which are helpful for pain radiating below the knee. Recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if medication is necessary. COX-2 inhibitors, muscle relaxants, and opiate analgesics have not been shown to be more effective than NSAIDs for acute low back pain. Consider imaging if patients have no improvement after 6 weeks, although diagnostic tests or imaging is not usually required. GRADE B RECOMMENDATIONS (based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence): Reassure patients that 90% of episodes resolve within 6 weeks-regardless of treatment. Advise patients that minor flares-ups may occur in the subsequent year. Consider a plain lumbosacral spine x-ray if there is suspicion of spinal fracture or compression. Consider a bone scan after 10 days, if fracture is still suspected or the patient has multiple sites of pain. Suspect cauda equina syndrome or severe or progressive neurological deficit if red flags are present. Obtain complete blood count, urinalysis, and sedimentation rate if cancer or infection are possibilities. If still suspicious, consider referral or perform other studies. Remember that a negative plain film x-ray does not rule out disease. GRADE C RECOMMENDATIONS (based on consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, or case series): Recommend ice for painful areas and stretching exercises. Discuss the use of proper body mechanics and safe back exercises for injury prevention. Refer for goal-directed manual physical therapy if there is no improvement in 1 to 2 weeks, not modalities such as heat, traction, ultrasound, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Do not refer for surgery in the absence of red flags."

In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the pain to improve. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physical therapy, and advice to stay active. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments. Evidence for the benefit of acupuncture is conflicting, with higher-quality trials showing no benefit. Patient education should focus on the natural history of the back pain, its overall good prognosis, and recommendations for effective treatments."

We elicited knowledge and attitudes about back pain by asking respondents to indicate their level of agreement with a set of statements. We also elicited their likely management by presenting 2 hypothetical scenarios.\nRESULTS: A total of 635 Victorian and 511 NSW GPs completed the latest survey. There were sustained improvements over time in Victorian physicians' beliefs about back pain and their stated behavior: e.g., at Survey 3, compared with baseline, Victorian physicians were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.0) times as likely as their NSW counterparts to know that patients with low back pain need not wait to be almost pain free to return to work; 1.78 (95% CI, 1.27-2.49) times as likely not to order tests for acute low back pain and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.33-0.69) times as likely to order lumbosacral radiographs. They were also 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34-0.73) times as likely to prescribe bed rest and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.19-2.22) times as likely to advise work modification.\nCONCLUSIONS: A population-based strategy to shift societal views about back pain has had a sustained effect on GP beliefs and stated behavior 4.5 years after its cessation."

            "abstract": "At present, there is an increasing international trend towards evidence-based health care. The field of low back pain (LBP) research in primary care is an excellent example of evidence-based health care because there is a huge body of evidence from randomized trials. These trials have been summarized in a large number of systematic reviews. This paper summarizes the best available evidence from systematic reviews conducted within the framework of the Cochrane Back Review Group on non-invasive treatments for non-specific LBP. Data were gathered from the latest Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2. The Cochrane reviews were updated with additional trials, if available. Traditional NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and advice to stay active are effective for short-term pain relief in acute LBP. Advice to stay active is also effective for long-term improvement of function in acute LBP. In chronic LBP, various interventions are effective for short-term pain relief, i.e. antidepressants, COX2 inhibitors, back schools, progressive relaxation, cognitive-respondent treatment, exercise therapy, and intensive multidisciplinary treatment. Several treatments are also effective for short-term improvement of function in chronic LBP, namely COX2 inhibitors, back schools, progressive relaxation, exercise therapy, and multidisciplinary treatment. There is no evidence that any of these interventions provides long-term effects on pain and function. Also, many trials showed methodological weaknesses, effects are compared to placebo, no treatment or waiting list controls, and effect sizes are small. Future trials should meet current quality standards and have adequate sample size."

So-called 'red flags' are used to identify physical disorders. To obtain insight into psychosocial factors, 'yellow flags' are used. Acute low-back pain (0-12 weeks) is treated in a time-contingent manner. Staying active is better than bed rest. If chronicity threatens, exercise therapy can be advised. As part of an activating management, manipulation can be used. For pain relief, paracetamol is the drug of choice. The treatment of chronic low-back pain is aimed at the optimisation of the patients' functionality. Staying active is preferred here as well. Varied exercise therapy is advised. Back training may be considered. Manipulation can be used as part of an activating management. Paracetamol is preferred for pain relief. There is a limited role for percutaneous lumbar facet denervation. Behaviour therapy can be employed and there is a place for multidisciplinary programmes if other methods of treatment have proved insufficiently effective."

The effectiveness of each of these treatments is controversial. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of exercise therapy with normal activity in the treatment of employed adults with acute low back pain through an integrative synthesis and meta-analysis of published research. The integrative synthesis and meta-analytical results support the hypothesis that employed adults diagnosed with acute low back pain will have fewer number of days absent from work after exercise therapy when compared to number of days absent from work after normal activity. This study's weighted P is 0.0000003109. The weighted effect size D is 0.4785 and this is a strong effect of exercise on number of days absent from work. This study concluded that exercise therapy should be prescribed for the treatment of adults with acute low back pain to expedite recovery.

Especially the latter can be highlighted on the basis of a large number of systematic reviews.\nRESULTS: Bed rest is no longer regarded as an effective treatment for episodes of acute LBP, except when the patient has evident clinical signs of nerve root compression. Exercise therapy comprises a wide range of concepts and underlying physiological principles. Different concepts are discussed. Evidence suggests no specific effects of exercise therapy in acute LBP. In chronic LBP, exercise as well as combined treatment with several modalities appear to be superior to conventional medical care. In the past decade, reconditioning of the paraspinal muscles is being given increasing importance in research. Several studies indicate the effectiveness of vigorous strengthening of paraspinal and trunk muscles on pain and even disc surgery. Different underlying pathologies seem to respond equally well to this concept. Back school concepts are not proven to have long-term effects on LBP. The literature on electrotherapy and massage in LBP is generally sparse. Nevertheless, some studies suggest the effectiveness of electrotherapy on pain reduction at least in the short term. Spinal mobilization seems to be effective in reducing pain.\nCONCLUSION: Based on these evidence-based conclusions, the patient's medical history, the investigation and the diagnosis the clinician has to devise an individual treatment plan that takes the deficiencies and requirements of the patient into account."

However, these lack consistency in some areas and valid data in others.

The guidelines have been reviewed to assess whether their recommendations remain supportable.\nCONCLUSIONS: Recent research appears to support current clinical guidelines, i.e. exercise may have a positive effect while bed rest is ineffective and may be harmful, simple analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have short-term benefits, and spinal manipulation may be effective in the first four weeks; no evidence was found for traction or back schools. However, we need more randomized controlled trials of treatments shown to be successful with the chronic population, e.g. focused on understanding psychological determinants, and using a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach. In the future this may help us to prevent acute low back progressing to the chronic state."

The purpose of this study was to examine physical therapists' reported management of acute and subacute lumbar impairment.\nSUBJECTS: One in 10 registered physical therapists who were randomly selected from southern Ontario, Canada, (n=454) and all registered physical therapists from northern Ontario (n=331) were surveyed.\nMETHODS: In the questionnaire, case scenarios covered 3 areas related to the management of lumbar impairment: (1) physical examination, (2) treatment and recommendations, and (3) therapists' beliefs regarding its management.\nRESULTS: Five hundred sixty-nine questionnaires were returned (response rate=72.5%). Only data obtained for therapists (n=274) whose weekly workload included more than 10% of people with lumbar impairment were used in the analysis. Overall, patient education, exercise, and electrotherapeutic and thermal modalities were the preferred interventions for acute lumbar impairment (symptom onset of less than 5 weeks) with or without sciatica, whereas exercise and work modification were preferred for subacute lumbar impairment (symptom onset of 5 weeks or longer). There was a trend of using electrotherapeutic and thermal modalities with uncertain effectiveness. Only 46.3% of the therapists agreed or strongly agreed that practice guidelines were useful for managing lumbar impairment.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although the physical therapists surveyed, in general, followed the guidelines in managing acute lumbar impairment, they felt uncertain regarding the value of practice guidelines.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common reason for consulting a general practitioner, and advice on daily activities constitutes an important part in the primary care management of low back pain.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of bed rest for patients with acute low back pain or sciatica.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group trial register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Sport, Scisearch, and reference lists of relevant articles. We also contacted authors of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: December 1998.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised studies or quasi randomised studies where at least one comparison group of adult patients with acute low back pain with or without radiation of pain below the knee was advised to rest in bed for at least two days and one group was not, or where comparison groups were advised to stay in bed for different lengths of time. The main outcomes of interest were pain, functional status, recovery and return to work.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.\nMAIN RESULTS: Nine trials with a total of 1435 patients were included. Five trials met all four validity criteria and were assessed to have low risk of bias, while four trials were assessed to have moderate to high risk of bias. Four trials compared bed rest with advice to stay active, and overall the results were heterogeneous. Overall results from two high quality studies indicate no difference in pain intensity at three weeks follow-up [Standardized Mean Difference 0.0 (95%CI: -0.3, 0.2)], and a small difference in functional status in favour of staying active [Weighted Mean Difference 3.2 (on a 0-100 scale) (95%CI 0.6, 5.8)]. Two high quality trials reported no differences in pain intensity between two to three days of bed rest and seven days of bed rest. Another two high-quality trials found no differences between bed rest and exercises in pain intensity or functional status.\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Bed rest compared to acvice to stay active will at best have small effects, and at worst might have small harmful effects on acute LBP. Differences in effects of advice to stay in bed compared with advice to stay active are small for patients with low back pain with or without sciatica. There is not an important difference in the effects of bed rest compared with exercises in the treatment of acute low back pain, or seven days compared with two to three days of bed rest in patients with low back pain of different duration with and without radiating pain."

A 29-year-old woman with low back pain was prescribed more than 2 weeks of bed rest, during which she developed progressive bilateral lower extremity complaints that were ascribed to nerve root irritation. Her symptoms were initially treated with physical therapy and epidural steroid injections. A Doppler examination and ventilation-perfusion scan revealed extensive deep venous thromboses and mismatches consistent with pulmonary embolism. This case illustrates an unusual extraspinal source of lower extremity symptoms associated with low back pain and further supports the role of early mobilization in the treatment of back pain."

The treatment recommendations are based on orthopaedic teaching, but the current management is causing increasing dissatisfaction. Many general practitioners (GPs) are confused about what constitutes effective advice.\nAIM: To review all randomized controlled trials of bed rest and of medical advice to stay active for acute back pain.\nMETHOD: A systematic review based on a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 to April 1996 with complete citation tracking for randomized controlled trials of bed rest or medical advice to stay active and continue ordinary daily activities. The inclusion criteria were: primary care setting, patients with low back pain of up to 3 months duration, and patient-centred outcomes (rate of recovery from the acute attack, relief of pain, restoration of function, satisfaction with treatment, days off work and return to work, development of chronic pain and disability, recurrent attacks, and further health care use).\nRESULTS: Ten trials of bed rest and eight trials of advice to stay active were identified. Consistent findings showed that bed rest is not an effective treatment for acute low back pain but may delay recovery. Advice to stay active and to continue ordinary activities results in a faster return to work, less chronic disability, and fewer recurrent problems.\nCONCLUSION: A simple but fundamental change from the traditional prescription of bed rest to positive advice about staying active could improve clinical outcomes and reduce the personal and social impact of back pain."

            "abstract": "Aging is typically accompanied by gradual but progressive physiological changes and an increased prevalence of acute and chronic illness in any organs. Musculoskeltal system is one of the most involved organs in geriatric patients. Appropriate roles in geriatric rehabilitation for musculoskeltal disorders should be emphasized not only to treat the disorders, but also to prevent many complications cause by specific disease or injury. Representative management methods in geriatric rehabilitation are introduced in this section. Rest is often effective, especially in the acute phase of illness or injury. However, cautions should be paid in disuse syndrome which may be produced by prolonged bed rest. Major manifestations in this syndrome includes muscle weakness and atrophy, joint contracture, decubitus, osteoporosis, ectopic ossification, cardiovascular impairment, pneumonia, urological and mental problems. Physical agents such as heat, cold, light and pressure have been used as therapeutic agents. Electrical stimulation is often effective in the treatment of low-back pain syndrome. Traction is the act of drawing, or a pulling force. Its mechanism to relieve pain seems to immobilize the injured parts, to increase peripheral circulation by massage effect and to improve muscle spasm. Brace is very effective to control acute pain in musculoskeltal system. However, long-term wear of brace should be avoided to prevent the disuse syndrome. Exercise is one of the most important rehabilitation modalities. This includes stretching and muscle strengthening programs. Education of body mechanism in activity of daily living is essential in rehabilitation of geriatric patients."

Epidural administration of corticosteroids with longterm effect and bupivacaine by a translumbar approach in patients suffering from acute low back pain and sciatica causes an immediate, persistent pain relief and a more prompt regression of nerve root compression compared to patients just treated by bed rest and analgesics. The state of the art is based on recent meta-analyses and the understanding of the pathophysiology of discal hernia which includes inflammation. Contemporary concepts and data from recent reviews are summarized to elucidate current recommendations and suggestions for the management of patients with acute sciatica. The postulate of an application performed by an experienced anaesthesiologist is stressed. Advantages of this invasive form of therapy include reduction of addictive analgesic drugs, decreased time of absolute immobilisation, respectively strict bed rest, and of hospitalisation."

Unfortunately, truly objective information is lacking. The purpose of this and two subsequent review articles was to perform thorough scrutiny and methodologic comparison among all obtainable, published randomized and controlled studies on low back pain (LBP) interventions leading to return to work. The study was confined to English language articles published from 1975 through 1993. Of more than 4,000 LBP citations, more than 500 were chosen for review. Of that number, 35 articles met the selection criteria of randomization, reasonable controls, and work return comparisons. This paper focuses on the 10 articles relating to interventions for acute (less than 4 weeks) LBP, and considers bed rest, exercise, spinal manipulation, back school, and case management. A 26-point quality system was used to compare the methodologic rigor of each article.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bed rest is a traditional treatment for back pain, yet only in recent years has the therapeutic benefit of this been questioned.\nAIM: The aim of this pilot study was to ascertain whether or not 48 hours' bed rest had an effect on the outcome of acute low back pain.\nMETHOD: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial to compare a prescription of 48 hours' strict bed rest with controls; the control subjects were encouraged to remain mobile and to have no daytime rest. Nine general practitioners from practices in the West Midlands recruited patients in the age range 16-60 years who presented with low back pain of less than seven days' duration, with or without pain radiation. The outcome measures assessed were: change in straight leg raise and lumbar flexion after seven days, Oswestry and Roland-Morris disability scores after seven days and 28 days, and time taken from work.\nRESULTS: Forty two patients were recruited: 20 were allocated to bed rest and 22 as controls. Compared with the bed rest group the control group had statistically better Roland-Morris scores at day seven (P < 0.05) but not at day 28. At day seven, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in straight leg raise or lumbar flexion measurements although the control group had a better mean lumbar flexion than the bed rest group. The improvement in disability scores at day seven compared with day one was similar for the two groups but more of the control group had fully recovered (defined as scores of one or zero on the Roland-Morris disability scale and five or less on the Oswestry disability scale) by day seven. Remaining mobile did not appear to cause any adverse effects. The number of days lost from work in both groups was equal. A large number of self-remedies and physical therapies were recorded by subjects from both groups.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study did not indicate whether bed rest or remaining mobile was superior for the treatment of acute low back pain; however, the study sample was small. Subjects in the control group possibly fared better as they appeared to have better lumbar flexion at day seven. It appears that 48 hours' bed rest cannot be recommended for the treatment of acute low back pain on the basis of this small study. Large-scale definitive trials are required to detect clinically significant differences."

The patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: bed rest for two days (67 patients), back-mobilizing exercises (52 patients), or the continuation of ordinary activities as tolerated (the control group; 67 patients). Outcomes and costs were assessed after 3 and 12 weeks.\nRESULTS: After 3 and 12 weeks, the patients in the control group had better recovery than those prescribed either bed rest or exercises. There were statistically significant differences favoring the control group in the duration of pain, pain intensity, lumbar flexion, ability to work as measured subjectively, the Oswestry back-disability index, and number of days absent from work. Recovery was slowest among the patients assigned to bed rest. The overall costs of care did not differ significantly among the three groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute low back pain, continuing ordinary activities within the limits permitted by the pain leads to more rapid recovery than either bed rest or back-mobilizing exercises."

Responses were compared with guidelines suggested by the Quebec Task Force on Spinal Disorders.\nRESULTS: Almost 1200 physicians responded. More than 80% of these physicians believed physical therapy is effective, but this consensus was lacking for other treatments. Fewer than half of the physicians believed that spinal manipulation is effective for acute or chronic back pain or that epidural steroid injections, traction, and corsets are effective for acute back pain. Bed rest and narcotic analgesics were recommended by substantial minorities of physicians for patients with chronic pain. The Quebec Task Force found little scientific support for the effectiveness of most of the treatments found to be in common use.\nCONCLUSIONS: The lack of consensus among physicians could be attributable to the absence of clear evidence-based clinical guidelines, ignorance or rejection of existing scientific evidence, excessive commitment to a particular mode of therapy, or a tendency to discount the efficacy of competing treatments."

Risk factors for the onset of acute pain identified at the workplace refer to mechanical and psychomental strain. Vibration as well as lifting and carrying of heavy loads, especially if combined with a twisting of the trunk, are the most prominent mechanical risks, whereas dissatisfaction with the job or the working conditions, especially if there is a lack of social support either at the workplace or at home by the family or the spouse, increase the risk on a psychosocial level. Although these risks continue to be effective in the process of chronicity, other risks pertaining to behavioral and emotional reactions to the acute pain episode gain in importance. At the acute level, avoidance of physical and social activities are often encouraged by physicians who prescribe bed rest or give advice to regulate the active reinvolvement in daily life by assessing pain levels ('let the pain guide'). On the other hand, with regard to the prevention of chronicity, a strategy of graded early activation aiming at a reinforcement of healthy behaviors has more beneficial effects. After a short period of bed rest, no longer than two days, if at all necessary, patients are taught to maintain their daily activities and to practice specified exercises, while receiving time-contingent pain medication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

For these reasons, it is important that the risk factors that correlate with the development of chronic pain be considered at the early stage of acute low-back pain (ALBP) in order to implement early treatment to prevent the condition from becoming chronic. Although most of the studies in this field suffer from methodological problems, it appears that the ALBP patients who carry the highest risk of becoming chronic are those who report previous pain episodes, who describe their pain as extending over a wide area of their body and as deep and central, who display no objective findings, who suffer from anxiety and depression, and who \"always feel sick.\" The risk in these patients is further increased when they have a lower educational level and are physically inactive. The recommended early treatment includes shorter periods of bed rest, time-contingent rather than pain-contingent medication, aerobic exericises, education in body mechanics, and behavioural training. In light of the need to contain costs, a program for the prevention of chronic back pain can only be provided for those ALBP patients with an increased risk of having CLBP. Further research on the prevention on CLBP is needed."

Short-term outcome was measured by the number of days lost from work and longer term outcome was measured by disability at the six-week follow-up. Unlike other published work, this study did not find obesity or a history of previous back problems to be related to a poorer outcome from acute episodes of low back pain. Among those patients not involved in manual labor, a history of anxiety or depression was a significant predictor of both greater work loss and longer term disability. Among this same group, cigarette smoking was also found to be related to greater long-term disability from acute low back pain. Further study of this relationship is needed. The number of hours of manual labor performed daily was a strong predictor of poor outcome (both short- and long-term) of acute episodes of low back pain. Among both manual laborers and professional-technical workers, the number of days off work (at bed rest) prescribed by the physician was significantly related to greater absenteeism from work; the physician's diagnosis of an actual or possible disc problem was also related (P less than .05) to greater work loss among manual laborers. Neither of these factors, however, was related to longer term disability."

Both groups were treated effectively, but earlier improvement occurred in patients given tizanidine/ibuprofen, particularly regarding pain at night and at rest. Doctors assessed the helpfulness of treatment: tizanidine/ibuprofen was significantly better than placebo/ibuprofen at day 3 (P = 0.05). Significant differences between treatments in favour of tizanidine/ibuprofen occurred in patients with moderate and severe pain at night (P less than 0.05), at rest (P less than 0.05) and those with moderate or severe sciatica (P less than 0.05). Significantly more patients given placebo/ibuprofen had gastro-intestinal side-effects compared with tizanidine/ibuprofen (P = 0.002).

Symptoms were assessed by the patient and doctor before treatment, and after 3 and 7 days. Patients recorded pain and aspirin consumption in a daily diary. Both treatments were effective. In patients who had taken no medication prior to entry, aspirin consumption was almost halved in the first 3 days of taking tizanidine compared with placebo (P = 0.037). Results for pain at rest, pain at night, restriction of movement and pain on movement suggest that tizanidine may give greater improvement, earlier. No serious drug-related adverse events or abnormal biochemistry or haematology were observed in either group. Drowsiness occurred in 22% of patients taking tizanidine although, in patients with severe acute low-back pain, sedation, analgesia and bed rest might be beneficial and desired.

Factors associated with cough duration and clinical decisions were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of the 125 enrolled patients, 118 (94%) received an antibiotic, 97 (78%) a cough suppressant, 87 (70%) a systemic corticosteroid, and 39 (31%) a chest X-ray (CXR). Longer duration of cough was associated with the presence of self-reported wheezing or noises (adjusted odds ratio 6.29, 95% CI 1.36-29.16) while the presence of both wheezing and crackles on a clinician chest exam was associated with shorter duration (aOR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.27).

However, this practice is seldom used because uncertainty about diagnosis, and fear of consequences of discontinuing antibiotic therapy, as well as perceived pressure to continue prescribing antibiotics and potential conflict with patients are more of a concern for GPs than antibiotic resistance. The main objective of this study is to determine whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy when a GP no longer considers it necessary has any impact on the number of days with severe symptoms.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial. The study was conducted in 10 primary care centres in Spain. We included patients from 18 to 75 years of age with uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infections-acute rhinosinusitis, acute sore throat, influenza or acute bronchitis-who had previously taken any dose of antibiotic for <3 days, which physicians no longer considered necessary. The patients were randomly assigned to the usual strategy of continuing antibiotic treatment or to discontinuing antibiotic therapy. A sample size of 240 patients per group was calculated on the basis of a reduction of 1\u2009day in the duration of severe symptoms being a clinically relevant outcome. The primary outcome was the duration of severe symptoms, that is, symptoms scored 5 or 6 by means of validated symptom diaries. Secondary outcomes included antibiotics taken, adverse events, patient satisfaction and complications within the first 3 months.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethical Board of Fundaci\u00f3 Jordi Gol i Gurina (reference number: 16/093).

Acute bronchitis is a common reason for consultations with general medical practitioners, and antibiotics are often prescribed even though guidelines recommend not prescribing them for uncomplicated acute bronchitis.\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the antibiotic prescription patterns of South African (SA) general medical practitioners in the treatment of acute bronchitis.\nMETHODS: The 2013 claims for members of 11 health insurance schemes were analysed to assess antibiotic prescription patterns for patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The patterns were assessed by type of bronchitis, chronic health status of the patients, sex and age group. The types of antibiotic prescribed were also analysed.\nRESULTS: Of 166 821 events analysed, an antibiotic was prescribed in more than half (52.9%). There were significant differences by type of bronchitis and chronic health status. Patients with viral bronchitis were more likely to be prescribed an antibiotic than those with bacterial bronchitis (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 - 1.26).

Fragile patients are at heightened risk for ischemic and bleeding events.\nOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban 2.5\u00a0mg in fragile patients from VOYAGER PAD.\nMETHODS: Patients were categorized as fragile based on prespecified criteria (age &gt;75 years, weight\u00a0\u226450\u00a0kg, or baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate\u00a0&lt;50\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular etiology, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death. The principal safety outcome was TIMI major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of 6,564 randomized patients, a total of 1,674 subjects were categorized as fragile at baseline. In the placebo arm, fragile patients were at higher risk of the primary outcome (HR: 1.34; 95%\u00a0CI: 1.12-1.61) and TIMI major bleeding (HR: 1.57; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.83-2.96), compared with nonfragile patients. The effect of rivaroxaban on the primary endpoint was not modified by frailty status (fragile HR: 0.93; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.75-1.15; nonfragile HR: 0.83; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.72-0.97; P\u00a0interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.37). Rivaroxaban increased TIMI major bleeding in fragile (HR: 1.54; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.82-2.91) and nonfragile patients (HR: 1.37; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.84-2.23; P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.65).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD after lower extremity revascularization meeting fragile criteria are at higher risk of ischemic complications and bleeding. Rivaroxaban reduces ischemic risk and increases bleeding regardless of frailty status. These data may assist in personalization of antithrombotic therapy in fragile population."

            "abstract": "Building on seminal studies of the last 20 years, genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has become a clinical reality in the form of targeted exonic sequencing of known disease-causing genes. This has been driven primarily by the decreasing cost of sequencing, but the high profile of genome-wide association studies, the launch of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, and new legislative protection have also played important roles. In the clinical management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, genetic testing is primarily used for family screening. An increasing role is recognized, however, in diagnostic settings: in the differential diagnosis of HCM; in the differentiation of HCM from hypertensive or athlete's heart; and more rarely in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Aside from diagnostic clarification and family screening, use of the genetic test for guiding therapy remains controversial, with data currently too limited to derive a reliable mutation risk prediction from within the phenotypic noise of different modifying genomes. Meanwhile, the power of genetic testing derives from the confidence with which a mutation can be called present or absent in a given individual. This confidence contrasts with our more limited ability to judge the significance of mutations for which co-segregation has not been demonstrated. These variants of \"unknown\" significance represent the greatest challenge to the wider adoption of genetic testing in HCM. Looking forward, next-generation sequencing technologies promise to revolutionize the current approach as whole genome sequencing will soon be available for the cost of today's targeted panel. In summary, our future will be characterized not by lack of genetic information but by our ability to effectively parse it."

It has been described as a source of overdiagnosis and off-label treatment. This review aims to describe the diagnostic errors and adverse events associated with the diagnosis and treatment of PTLDS.\nMETHODS: systematic review of the literature in the Medline and Cochrane Library databases, according to PRISMA criteria, including randomized clinical trials (RCT), observational studies, and case reports addressing diagnostic errors and adverse events published between January 2010 and November 2020 in English or French. Selection used a quadruple reading process on the basis of the titles and abstracts of the different articles, followed by a full reading.\nRESULTS: 17 studies were included: 1 RCT, 6 observational studies and 10 case reports. In the 6 observational studies, overdiagnosis rates were very high, ranging from 80 to 100%. The new diagnoses were often psychiatric, rheumatological and neurological. Disorders with somatic symptoms were often cited. Diagnostic delays were identified for cancers and frontoparietal dementia. In the RCT and observational studies, prolonged anti-infective treatments were also responsible for adverse events, with emergency room visits and/or hospitalization. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, sometimes with Clostridium difficile colitis, electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis, bacterial and fungal infections, and anaphylactic reactions.\nCONCLUSION: This review highlights the risks of prolonged anti-infective treatments that have not been proven to be beneficial in PTLDS. It emphasizes the ethical imperative of the \"primum non nocere\" principle, which underscores the importance of not causing harm to patients. Physicians should exercise caution in diagnosing PTLDS and consider the potential risks associated with off-label treatments."

            "abstract": "Lyme disease, a tick-borne multisystem disease, is caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato). It is a common illness in temperate countries, especially the United States, but the incidence is increasing across continents due to increasing reforestation, travel and adventure tourism, increased intrusion in the vector habitat, and changing habitat of the vector. Transmission primarily occurs via bite of an infected tick (Ixodes spp.). The appearance of an erythema migrans rash following a tick bite is diagnostic of early Lyme disease even without laboratory evidence. Borrelia lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans along with multisystem involvement occur in late disseminated and chronic stages. A two-step serologic testing protocol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by confirmation of positive and equivocal results by Western immunoblot is recommended for the diagnosis. Transplacental transmission to infant occurs in the first trimester with possible congenital Lyme disease making treatment imperative during antenatal period. The treatment is most effective in the early stages of the disease, whereas rheumatological, neurological, or other late manifestations remain difficult to treat with antibiotics alone. Treatment with oral doxycycline is preferred for its additional activity against other tick-borne illnesses which may occur concurrently in 10%-15% of cases. New-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin are alternative options in patients with doxycycline contraindications. No vaccine is available and one episode of the disease will not confer life-long immunity; thus, preventive measures remain a priority. The concept of post-Lyme disease syndrome versus chronic Lyme disease remains contested for want of robust evidence favoring benefits of prolonged antibiotic therapy."

Currently, little is known about the cause or epidemiology of PTLDS.\nMETHODS: We conducted a data-driven study with a large nationwide administrative dataset, which consists of more than 98 billion billing and 1.4 billion prescription records between 2008 and 2016, to identify unique aspects of PTLDS that could have diagnostic and etiologic values. We defined PTLDS based on its symptomatology and compared the demographic, longitudinal changes of comorbidity, and antibiotic prescriptions between patients who have Lyme with absence of prolonged symptoms (APS) and PTLDS.\nFINDINGS: The age and temporal distributions were similar between Lyme APS and PTLDS. The PTLDS-to-Lyme APS case ratio was 3.42%. The co-occurrence of 3 out of 19 chronic conditions were significantly higher in PTLDS versus Lyme APS-odds ratio and 95% CI for anemia, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthrosis were 1.46 (1.11-1.92), 1.39 (1.15-1.68), and 1.62 (1.23-2.12) respectively.

Their underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is unclear. However, there is no evidence for microbiological persistence in these cases and attempts to resolve the symptoms by repeated or prolonged antibiotic treatment have not been convincingly successful, but they may rather be harmful. To narrow down the controversially handled entity of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, case definitions have been proposed, acknowledging PTLDS as a complex of nonspecific, subjective symptoms, which are neither caused by ongoing infection nor by any other identifiable disease.

Ixodes ricinus is present throughout metropolitan France, except for the Mediterranean region. The debate revolves around whether or not a chronic form of Lyme disease exists. This controversy is not limited to France but has been reported worldwide. In France, in 2019, 24 scientific societies representing the medical disciplines most involved in Lyme disease, including the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Rhumatologie (French Rheumatology Society [SFR]) and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pathologie Infectieuse de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise (French Infectious Disease Society-SPILF), published recommendations on the management of Lyme borreliosis following a submission to the Director General of Health. These recommendations conflict with those of the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS), a multi-specialties independent group of physician, on a key point: whether to add a new nosological entity labeled as \"persistent polymorphous signs and symptoms (or syndrome) possibly due to tick bite.\" The creation of this new syndrome risks should increase anchoring bias, leading to the attribution of all symptoms to a possible tick bite, without considering differential diagnoses. Lyme disease has been extensively studied. Erythema migrans is the primary clinical manifestation. In the presence of nonmetabolic, nonseptic monoarthritis involving the knee or radiculitis of a lower limb during the summer, Lyme disease should be suspected. Serologic testing for Lyme disease is reliable in the case of late forms such as chronic arthritis, while the detection of Borrelia DNA in synovial fluid by PCR is inconsistent. Sometimes, the serology can be misleading in early forms such as radiculitis. Treatment is based on doxycycline for 14 days in early forms (radiculitis), or 28 days in late forms (arthritis). Arthritis can persist or recur after antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of a diffuse polyalgia syndrome (fibromyalgia) following Lyme disease does not seem to differ much from that in the general population. It is not improved by prolonged antibiotic therapy, which is therefore not recommended."

Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, complemented by serological confirmation of infection once an antibody response has been mounted. Manifestations usually respond to appropriate antibiotic regimens, but the disease can be followed by sequelae, such as immune arthritis or residual damage to affected tissues. A subset of individuals reports persistent symptoms, including fatigue, pain, arthralgia, and neurocognitive symptoms, which in some people are severe enough to fulfil the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of such persistent symptoms following antimicrobial treatment varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Persistent active infection in humans has not been identified as a cause of this syndrome, and randomized treatment trials have invariably failed to show any benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment.

The features that complicate the diagnosis of PS within chronic borreliosis were: the absence of erythema migrans in the history of 80% of patients and in more than half of the cases of the acute period of the disease, the presence in most patients (60%) of asymmetric onset of the PS with rest tremor in 40% cases and a significant reduction in the severity of PS as a result of therapy with levodopa. The onset of complete regression of the clinical manifestations of PS and reduction of the titer of antibodies and obtaining the negative results during dynamic serological study in response to prolonged antibiotic therapy provided a basis to verify the diagnosis of borreliosis with PS in these patients."

            "abstract": "Although most patients with Lyme disease can be cured with a 2-4 week antibiotic therapy, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer prolonged persistent symptoms, a condition called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The cause for PTLDS is unclear and hotly debated. Borrelia burgdorferi develops morphological variants under stress conditions but their significance is not clear. Here we isolated the biofilm-like microcolony (MC) and planktonic (spirochetal form and round body) (SP) variant forms from the stationary phase culture of B. burgdorferi and showed that the MC and SP variant forms were not only more tolerant to the current Lyme antibiotics but also caused more severe arthritis in mice than the log phase spirochete form (LOG). We propose to divide the persistent Lyme disease into two categories: (1) early development of persistent disease from inoculation with persister/biofilm at the beginning of infection introduced by tick bites, or Type I persistent disease (i.e., PTLDS); and (2) late development of persistent disease due to initial infection not being diagnosed or treated in time such that the infection develops into late persistent disease, or Type II persistent disease. Importantly, we show that the murine infection caused by LOG could be eradicated by ceftriaxone whereas the persistent infection established with MC could not be eradicated by doxycycline (Doxy), ceftriaxone (CefT), or vancomycin (Van), or Doxy+CefT or Van+CefT, but could only be eradicated by the persister drug combination daptomycin+doxycycline+ceftriaxone. We conclude that varying levels of persistence and pathologies of Borrelia infection and the corresponding different treatment responses are mostly dictated by the heterogeneous B. burgdorferi variant forms inoculated at the time of tick bites. These findings may have broad implications for understanding pathogenesis and treatment of not only persistent Lyme disease but also other persistent infections in general and call for studies to evaluate if treatment of persistent infections with persister drug combination regimens is more effective than the current mostly single-antibiotic monotherapy."

We have carefully considered the points raised by these groups, along with our own critical review of the treatment trials.

Forces motivating this movement are explored, as are tactics used to advance non-scientific ideas that have included legal action and garnering legislative endorsement.

            "abstract": "Following antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, some patients report persistent or relapsing symptoms of pain, fatigue, and/or cognitive deficits. Factors other than active infection, including immune abnormalities, have been suggested, but few clues regarding mechanism have emerged. Furthermore, the effect of antibiotic treatment on immune response in affected individuals remains unknown. In this study, a longitudinal analysis of specific immune markers of interest was carried out in patients with a history of Lyme disease and persistent objective memory impairment, prior to and following treatment with either ceftriaxone or placebo. IFN\u03b1 activity was measured by detection of serum-induced changes in specific target genes, using a functional cell-based assay and quantitative real-time PCR. Level and pattern of antibody reactivity to brain antigens and to Borrelia burgdorferi proteins were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblotting. Sera from the patient cohort induced significantly higher expression of IFIT1 and IFI44 target genes than those from healthy controls, indicating increased IFN\u03b1 activity. Antibody reactivity to specific brain and borrelial proteins was significantly elevated in affected patients. IFN\u03b1 activity and antibody profile did not change significantly in response to ceftriaxone. The heightened antibody response implies enhanced immune stimulation, possibly due to prolonged exposure to the organism prior to the initial diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. The increase in IFN\u03b1 activity is suggestive of a mechanism contributing to the ongoing neuropsychiatric symptoms."

            "abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. Transmission occurs primarily through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Identification of an erythema migrans rash following a tick bite is the only clinical manifestation sufficient to make the diagnosis of Lyme disease in the absence of laboratory confirmation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a two-tier serologic testing protocol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay initially, followed by the more specific Western blot to confirm the diagnosis when the assay samples are positive or equivocal. The treatment of Lyme disease is determined mainly by the clinical manifestations of the disease. Doxycycline is often the preferred agent for oral treatment because of its activity against other tick-borne illnesses. Preventive measures include avoiding areas with high tick burdens, wearing protective clothing, using tick repellants (e.g., diethyltoluamide [DEET]), performing frequent body checks and bathing following outdoor activities, and instituting environmental landscape modifications (e.g., grass mowing, deer exclusion fencing) to reduce the tick burden. Although there is controversy regarding treatment of post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease, there is no biologic or clinical trial evidence indicating that prolonged antibiotic therapy is of benefit."

An accumulating body of evidence suggests that Lyme disease is the appropriate diagnosis for only a minority of patients in whom it is suspected. In prospective studies of Lyme disease, very few patients go on to have a chronic syndrome dominated by subjective complaints. There is no systematic evidence that Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiology of Lyme disease, can be identified in patients with chronic symptoms following treated Lyme disease. Multiple prospective trials have revealed that prolonged courses of antibiotics neither prevent nor alleviate such post-Lyme syndromes. Extended courses of intravenous antibiotics have resulted in severe adverse events, which in light of their lack of efficacy, make them contraindicated."

A 15-year-old boy presented at the age of 9 with recurrent rather painless swelling of the right knee. Altogether four episodes lasting for 1-2 weeks each occurred over a period of 18 months before medical advice was sought. Physical examination revealed only a slightly limited range of motion. Living in an endemic area of borreliosis, he reported a tick bite 6 months prior to onset of his symptoms with erythema migrans and was treated for 10 days with amoxicillin. Serology revealed two positive unspecific bands in IgG immunoblot (p41 and 66) with slight positivity for ELISA. Ultrasound revealed synovial thickening and increased fluid. Despite the weak positive serology a diagnosis of lyme arthritis could not be excluded and intravenous antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was started. After two further relapses antiinflammatory therapy including intraarticular steroids were introduced with no long lasting effect. A chronical disease developed with alternate periods of swelling and almost complete remission. Ultrasound as well as MRI demonstrated ongoing signs of synovitis, therefore after further progression, a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed showing an inconspicuous knee joint. A second MRI showed focal suprapatellar enhancement and was followed by open arthrotomy revealing a histopathological proven synovial cavernous juxtaarticular hemangioma. To our knowledge, the differential diagnosis of lyme arthritis and synovial hemangioma has not yet been reported despite obvious clinical similarities. In conclusion, in children and adolescents synovial hemangioma has to be considered in differential diagnosis of recurrent knee swelling. Early diagnosis is important to prevent prolonged suffering from chronic joint swelling with probable joint damages, unnecessary treatment procedures and as well school and sports absenteeism."

The pathophysiological mechanisms which underlie this syndrome of post-treatment chronic systemic illness remain unclear. For some physicians post-treatment symptoms indicate a persistent infection requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy. For others, there is no benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The difficulty of assessment encountered in studies is significant because many symptoms are subjective.

Patients with persistent symptoms after standard (2-4-week) antibiotic therapy for this tickborne illness have been denied further antibiotic treatment as a result of the perception that long-term infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and associated tickborne pathogens is rare or nonexistent.\nMETHODS: I review the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi infection and the peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic Lyme disease testing, standard treatment results, and coinfection with tickborne agents, such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species. I also examine uncontrolled and controlled trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease.\nRESULTS: The complex \"stealth\" pathology of B. burgdorferi allows the spirochete to invade diverse tissues, elude the immune response, and establish long-term infection. Commercial testing for Lyme disease is highly specific but relatively insensitive, especially during the later stages of disease. Numerous studies have documented the failure of standard antibiotic therapy in patients with Lyme disease. Previous uncontrolled trials and recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that prolonged antibiotic therapy (duration, >4 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms. Tickborne coinfections may increase the severity and duration of infection with B. burgdorferi.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be useful and justifiable in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease and coinfection with tickborne agents."

However, well-performed prospective studies have found neither evidence of chronic infection nor a benefit worthy of long-term antibiotic therapy for these patients. Such extended antibiotic therapy poses hazards and cannot be viewed as acceptable. The term \"chronic Lyme disease\" should be discarded as misleading; rather, the term \"post-Lyme disease syndrome\" better reflects the postinfectious nature of this condition.

Although most studies have used parenteral regimens for neuroborreliosis, several European studies support use of oral doxycycline in adults with meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis (Level B), reserving parenteral regimens for patients with parenchymal CNS involvement, other severe neurologic symptomatology, or failure to respond to oral regimens. The number of children (> or =8 years of age) enrolled in rigorous studies of oral vs parenteral regimens has been smaller, making conclusions less statistically compelling.

From a pathophysiologic standpoint, the affinity of Borrelia burgdorferi for multiple cell types and the presence of nonreplicating forms of the Lyme disease spirochete have contributed to persistent infection and failure of simple antibiotic regimens. Newer approaches to the treatment of Lyme disease should take into account its clinical complexity in coinfected patients and the possible need for prolonged combination therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of this potentially debilitating illness.

In European endemic areas like northeast France, articular manifestations are, after neuroborreliosis, the most frequent extra-cutaneous features observed. Among the pathogenic species of Borrelia, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most frequently identified during Lyme arthritis, but others species also seem to be involved.\nCURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The diagnosis of Lyme arthritis is usually based on combined clinical data and serological laboratory tests. In atypical forms, detection of bacterial DNA could be useful. While mechanisms involved in acute Lyme arthritis are beginning to be better understood, the pathogenesis of chronic arthritis, which concerns about 10% of the patients, remains unknown. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the prolonged evolution of the articular disease: a chronic persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi, which evades the host immune system within the joint and/or an autoimmune mechanism by molecular mimicry. The antibiotic therapy is codified in acute arthritis, but is not really adapted in chronic Lyme arthritis or post-Lyme syndrome.\nFUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: To prevent the disease, the vaccine available in the United States does not offer complete protection and is not useful in Europe since the species heterogeneity is important for the outer surface protein A. A better understanding of Lyme disease pathogenesis can subsequently lead to new therapeutic or preventive approaches."

The patients received either intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g daily for 30 days, followed by oral doxycycline, 200 mg daily for 60 days, or matching intravenous and oral placebos. Each patient had well-documented, previously treated Lyme disease but had persistent musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms, or dysesthesia, often associated with fatigue. The primary outcome measures were improvement on the physical- and mental-health-component summary scales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36)--a scale measuring the health-related quality of life--on day 180 of the study.\nRESULTS: After a planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the studies be discontinued because data from the first 107 patients indicated that it was highly unlikely that a significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups would be observed with the planned full enrollment of 260 patients. Base-line assessments documented severe impairment in the patients' health-related quality of life. In intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences in the outcomes with prolonged antibiotic treatment as compared with placebo. Among the seropositive patients who were treated with antibiotics, there was improvement in the score on the physical-component summary scale of the SF-36, the mental-component summary scale, or both in 37 percent, no change in 29 percent, and worsening in 34 percent; among seropositive patients receiving placebo, there was improvement in 40 percent, no change in 26 percent, and worsening in 34 percent (P=0.96 for the comparison between treatment groups). The results were similar for the seronegative patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is considerable impairment of health-related quality of life among patients with persistent symptoms despite previous antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease.

Soon after the tick bite which transmits the infection, the pathognomonic skin rash erythema chronicum migrans occurs in 50 to 70% of patients, often with associated symptoms resembling a 'summer cold' or viral infection. Therapy for this stage of disease consists of 3 to 4 weeks of oral therapy. The agents currently used are: amoxicillin (500 mg 3 or 4 times daily) with or without probenecid 500 mg 3 times daily, doxycycline (100 mg twice daily), or tetracycline (500 mg 4 times daily). Longer duration therapy has never been evaluated and therefore is not currently indicated. Even patients with severe early manifestations of Lyme disease should be treated orally. Later features of Lyme disease include carditis and neurological disease, which can occur days to approximately 9 months after the onset of illness, and arthritis and neurological disease which can occur weeks to years after the onset of the illness. Treatment at this stage is with 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, currently cefotaxime (3 g every 12 hours), ceftriaxone (1 g every 12 hours or 2 g every day) and benzylpenicillin (14 g in divided doses). There is no evidence that longer duration therapy is indicated or more efficacious. The exception to this suggestion is the patient with isolated facial seventh cranial nerve palsy; if such a patient has no other signs or symptoms to suggest Lyme disease and has normal spinal fluid, oral therapy is usually sufficient, although some physicians will give concomitant corticosteroids to hasten the resolution of the palsy. Of major consequence to the practitioner and patient is the possibility that persistent symptoms (e.g. fibromyalgia) may be caused by a process which is no longer antibiotic-sensitive. Special care in the management of so-called 'chronic Lyme disease' is crucial lest the clinician prescribes prolonged or unending courses of antibiotics for such noninfectious problems."

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of insomnia and its associated risk factors during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic among Singapore residents.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study conducted online and in person, from May 2020 to June 2021, recruited Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 years and above, fluent in English, Chinese or Malay language. Respondents answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire, including Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), stress scale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS), chronic conditions checklist and COVID-19 related stressors (exposure to COVID-19, current and future perceived risk of infection). Chi-squared test followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine factors associated with insomnia.\nRESULTS: The study recruited 1129 respondents. Prevalence of insomnia was noted to be 7.4% in the sample. Insomnia was significantly associated with psychological distress- depression (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and anxiety (p\u2009<\u20090.001), financial loss as a source of stress (p\u2009<\u20090.012), ever been diagnosed with asthma (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and backache (p\u2009<\u20090.002).\nCONCLUSION: Insomnia was prevalent and associated with higher level of psychological distress among Singapore residents. These findings can be utilised to design effective targeted interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy, therapist assisted relaxation and meditation programs to improve sleep and reduce psychological distress. Interventions like these can be delivered via smartphone applications enabling easy access, delivery, and utilization by the vulnerable groups. Overall, these strategies would not only help people maintain better mental health and sleep quality during a pandemic but also build resilience, enhancing society's ability to cope with future crises."

            "abstract": "Mindfulness catalyzes health behavior change. Yet, interoception is dysregulated in depression, potentially impairing behavioral activation. We examined the mediating role of interoceptive appreciation, as measured by how much one trusts and listens to internal bodily signals, on behavior change. Primary care patients with depression, anxiety, or stress disorders related to chronic illness were randomized to Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC) using the Mindful Behavior Change curriculum or a low-dose mindfulness comparator. Participants (N = 274) completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) at 0 and 8 weeks. At week 7, participants chose a health behavior action plan. During weeks 8-10, participants reported their action plan initiation (API) level. We investigated the effect of MTPC on API level (MTPC-API), the mediating role of interoceptive appreciation (Body Listening [MAIA-BL] + Trusting [MAIA-T]), and baseline depression severity as a moderator. MTPC had a significant direct effect on API. Interoceptive appreciation (MAIA-BL + MAIA-T) had a significant indirect effect on API (CI=0.15-0.56). Without depression (n = 76), MAIA-BL partially mediated MTPC-API (CI=0.02-0.87). With moderate-to-severe depression (n = 132), MAIA-T partially mediated MTPC-API (CI=0.01-0.85). Interoceptive appreciation helps people listen to motivating bodily signals. In depression, regaining body trust may be an important step on a mindful path towards change."

The study was conducted between August 2019 and July 2023.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 8 different groups as determined by 3 two-level intervention component combinations: intervention introduction method (mobile app vs therapist call), mindfulness meditation dose (once daily vs twice daily), and management of increasing symptoms (mobile app vs therapist call).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale score (range, 0-27) at 1 month. Secondary outcomes included anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and posttraumatic stress disorder (Posttraumatic Stress Scale) symptoms at 1 and 3 months, adherence, and feasibility. General linear models were used to compare main effects and interactions of the components among intervention groups. A formal decisional framework was used to determine an optimized intervention version.\nRESULTS: A total of 247 participants (mean [SD] age, 50.2 [15.4] years; 104 [42.1%] women) were randomized. Twice-daily meditation compared with once-daily meditation was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI, 0.04-2.4)-unit lower mean estimated PHQ-9 score at 1 month and a 1.5 (95% CI, 0.1-2.8)-unit lower estimated mean score at 3 months.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interventions incorporating meditation to address stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve self-management, are becoming popular for many health conditions. Stress is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and clusters with other modifiable behavioural risk factors, such as smoking. Meditation may therefore be a useful CVD prevention strategy.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of meditation, primarily mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and transcendental meditation (TM), for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers on 14 November 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 12 weeks or more in adults at high risk of CVD and those with established CVD. We explored four comparisons: MBIs versus active comparators (alternative interventions); MBIs versus non-active comparators (no intervention, wait list, usual care); TM versus active comparators; TM versus non-active comparators.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were CVD clinical events (e.g. cardiovascular mortality), blood pressure, measures of psychological distress and well-being, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included other CVD risk factors (e.g. blood lipid levels), quality of life, and coping abilities. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 81 RCTs (6971 participants), with most studies at unclear risk of bias. MBIs versus active comparators (29 RCTs, 2883 participants) Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were reported in six trials (388 participants) where heterogeneity was considerable (SBP: MD -6.08 mmHg, 95% CI -12.79 to 0.63, I2 = 88%; DBP: MD -5.18 mmHg, 95% CI -10.65 to 0.29, I2 = 91%; both outcomes based on low-certainty evidence). There was little or no effect of MBIs on anxiety (SMD -0.06 units, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.13; I2 = 0%; 9 trials, 438 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or depression (SMD 0.08 units, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.24; I2 = 0%; 11 trials, 595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Perceived stress was reduced with MBIs (SMD -0.24 units, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.03; I2 = 0%; P = 0.03; 6 trials, 357 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on well-being (SMD -0.18 units, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.32; 1 trial, 63 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on smoking cessation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.68; I2 = 79%; 6 trials, 1087 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported CVD clinical events or adverse events. MBIs versus non-active comparators (38 RCTs, 2905 participants) Clinical events were reported in one trial (110 participants), providing very low-certainty evidence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.42). SBP and DBP were reduced in nine trials (379 participants) but heterogeneity was substantial (SBP: MD -6.62 mmHg, 95% CI -13.15 to -0.1, I2 = 87%; DBP: MD -3.35 mmHg, 95% CI -5.86 to -0.85, I2 = 61%; both outcomes based on low-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence of reductions in anxiety (SMD -0.78 units, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.41; I2 = 61%; 9 trials, 533 participants; low-certainty evidence), depression (SMD -0.66 units, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.41; I2 = 67%; 15 trials, 912 participants; low-certainty evidence) and perceived stress (SMD -0.59 units, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.29; I2 = 70%; 11 trials, 708 participants; low-certainty evidence) but heterogeneity was substantial. Well-being increased (SMD 0.5 units, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.91; I2 = 47%; 2 trials, 198 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on smoking cessation (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.13; I2 = 0%; 2 trials, 453 participants; low-certainty evidence). One small study (18 participants) reported two adverse events in the MBI group, which were not regarded as serious by the study investigators (RR 5.0, 95% CI 0.27 to 91.52; low-certainty evidence). No subgroup effects were seen for SBP, DBP, anxiety, depression, or perceived stress by primary and secondary prevention. TM versus active comparators (8 RCTs, 830 participants) Clinical events were reported in one trial (201 participants) based on low-certainty evidence (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.49). SBP was reduced (MD -2.33 mmHg, 95% CI -3.99 to -0.68; I2 = 2%; 8 trials, 774 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), with an uncertain effect on DBP (MD -1.15 mmHg, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.55; I2 = 53%; low-certainty evidence). There was little or no effect on anxiety (SMD 0.06 units, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.33; I2 = 0%; 3 trials, 200 participants; low-certainty evidence), depression (SMD -0.12 units, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.07; I2 = 0%; 5 trials, 421 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or perceived stress (SMD 0.04 units, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.57; I2 = 70%; 3 trials, 194 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported adverse events or smoking rates. No subgroup effects were seen for SBP or DBP by primary and secondary prevention. TM versus non-active comparators (2 RCTs, 186 participants) Two trials (139 participants) reported blood pressure, where reductions were seen in SBP (MD -6.34 mmHg, 95% CI -9.86 to -2.81; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence) and DBP (MD -5.13 mmHg, 95% CI -9.07 to -1.19; I2 = 18%; very low-certainty evidence). One trial (112 participants) reported anxiety and depression and found reductions in both (anxiety SMD -0.71 units, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.32; depression SMD -0.48 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.11; low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported CVD clinical events, adverse events, or smoking rates.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large number of studies included in the review, heterogeneity was substantial for many of the outcomes, which reduced the certainty of our findings. We attempted to address this by presenting four main comparisons of MBIs or TM versus active or inactive comparators, and by subgroup analyses according to primary or secondary prevention, where there were sufficient studies. The majority of studies were small and there was unclear risk of bias for most domains. Overall, we found very little information on the effects of meditation on CVD clinical endpoints, and limited information on blood pressure and psychological outcomes, for people at risk of or with established CVD. This is a very active area of research as shown by the large number of ongoing studies, with some having been completed at the time of writing this review. The status of all ongoing studies will be formally assessed and incorporated in further updates."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Training outcomes of mindfulness interventions for anxiety have been extensively researched. Less is known about the acute effects of mindfulness induction and associated mechanisms. This systematic review aimed to identify 1) the effect of mindfulness induction on pre-post measures of state anxiety and attention among adults experiencing high levels of anxiety; and 2) the impact of predictors, mediators and moderators on post-induction changes in anxiety and attention. State distress and mindfulness were included as secondary outcomes.\nMETHODS: A systematic search was conducted in November 2021 in electronic databases using relevant search terms. Five studies (four randomised controlled trials and one non-randomised controlled trial) were included, comprising a total of 277 participants with elevated trait/generalised anxiety. Each study used a brief audio-based mindfulness induction exercise.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated mindfulness induction had medium and large effects on state anxiety (k\u00a0=\u00a03, n\u00a0=\u00a0100, g\u00a0=\u00a0-0.60, 95%CI [-1.04, -0.16]; p\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and state mindfulness (k\u00a0=\u00a02, n\u00a0=\u00a0110, g\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95%CI [0.52, 1.30], p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), respectively, when compared with non-therapeutic control conditions. Furthermore, two studies showed small and moderate effects of mindfulness on state anxiety when compared to therapeutic active controls, but were not pooled in a meta-analysis. While results could not be pooled for attention, there was limited evidence of behavioural improvements on tasks measuring aspects of attention following mindfulness induction. However, one study found an increase in Low Beta to High Beta ratio and a reduction in Beta activity in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex following mindfulness induction. Moreover, another study found aspects of state mindfulness mediated reductions in state anxiety.\nLIMITATIONS: A small number of studies were included in the review, with high risk of bias and low certainty of evidence present.\nCONCLUSION: The findings support the use of mindfulness induction to reduce state anxiety in anxious individuals but suggest gains in state mindfulness may be a more realistic expected outcome. Further controlled trials are needed to delineate the relative effects of objectively assessed anxiety outcomes from mindfulness induction in clinically defined samples."

            "abstract": "The development of objective methods for assessing stress levels is an important task of applied neuroscience. Analysis of EEG recorded as part of a behavioral self-control program can serve as the basis for the development of test methods that allow classifying people by stress level. It is well known that participation in meditation practices leads to the development of skills of voluntary self-control over the individual's mental state due to an increased concentration of attention to themselves. As a consequence of meditation practices, participants can reduce overall anxiety and stress levels. The aim of our study was to develop, train and test a convolutional neural network capable of classifying individuals into groups of practitioners and non-practitioners of meditation by analysis of eventrelated brain potentials recorded during stop-signal paradigm. Four non-deep convolutional network architectures were developed, trained and tested on samples of 100 people (51 meditators and 49 non-meditators). Subsequently, all structures were additionally tested on an independent sample of 25 people. It was found that a structure using a one-dimensional convolutional layer combining the layer and a two-layer fully connected network showed the best performance in simulation tests. However, this model was often subject to overfitting due to the limitation of the display size of the data set. The phenomenon of overfitting was mitigated by changing the structure and scale of the model, initialization network parameters, regularization, random deactivation (dropout) and hyperparameters of cross-validation screening. The resulting model showed 82 % accuracy in classifying people into subgroups. The use of such models can be expected to be effective in assessing stress levels and inclination to anxiety and depression disorders in other groups of subjects."

Due to this a drastic change ensued in lifestyle with many succumbing to various kinds of stresses and psychological problems. This study aims to study the changing sleep patterns and level of anxiety among the working population due to the COVID-19 Pandemic lockdown.\nMETHODOLOGY: An online survey was conducted using a cloud-based website. The sleep patterns both prior to and during the lockdown period of the pandemic were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The level of anxiety during both these periods (before and during lockdown) amongst the working population was also assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scores (GADS).\nRESULTS: A total of 224 individuals participated in the study of which 52.7% were males and 47.3% were females. On analysis, the lifestyle and sleep deprivation scores showed that before the lockdown only 2.7% reported a low score out of total participants. However, this number was raised to 13.4% during the lockdown. The percentage of people reporting deteriorated sleep quality gradually increased with females reporting moderate to severe category of Generalized Anxiety Disorder scores as compared to Males.\nCONCLUSION: The study suggests that there has been a significant change in the sleep quality of the study participants due to Covid enforced lockdown which if unnoticed might lead to significant health problems. The effective use of programs like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises, if followed timely could reduce psychological distress to some extent."

COVID-19 pandemic led to a paradigm shift in delivery of health interventions from on-site to online/ tele-intervention mode. Focus shifted to tele-yoga as a reasonable and feasible alternative to in-person yoga. Studies have evaluated its effect among patients suffering from various disorders, their care givers, healthcare workers, and the general public. We have assessed the effect of tele- Yoga, including its appropriateness, acceptability, and benefits, via this narrative review.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed data base using predefined keywords. Inclusion criteria included controlled trials and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) which are completed and published in English language up to February 2022 with tele-yoga/online yoga as part of intervention. Exclusion criteria included articles in other language or articles whose full text is unavailable.\nRESULTS: After removing duplications and reviewing articles based on title, abstracts, and available full texts, seven studies with 391 participants were included. Majority of the trials took place in United States, with United Kingdom, Canada, and India following closely behind. Yoga can be safely administered via various online /tele interventions in both diseased and healthy individuls. Tele yoga or modules incorporating tele-yoga has been shown to improve symptoms like dyspnea, psychiatric/psychological burden including stress, anxiety and depression levels and may promote positive effects like spirituality.\nCONCLUSION: Tele-yoga is feasible and beneficial in healthy and diseased individuals. Larger well-designed RCTs comparing in-person yoga with tele-yoga are needed to ascertain their full benefits."

Data regarding pessimism, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality and all-cause mortality remained inconclusive. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide an overview of the association between pessimism, CVD outcomes and mortality. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception through July 2022 for studies evaluating pessimism and adverse outcomes. A total of 17 studies published between 1966 and July 2022 met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 232,533 individuals. Pooled hazard ratios were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses. Based on pooled analysis of adjusted HRs, pessimism was associated with adjusted HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.07-1.19) for all-cause mortality with minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 28.5%). Based on pooled analysis of adjusted HRs, pessimism was associated with adjusted HR of 1.30 (95% CI 0.43-3.95) for CHD mortality, adjusted HR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.05-1.91) for CVD mortality, and adjusted HR of 1.43 (95% CI 0.64-3.16) for stroke. In conclusion, pessimism seems to be significantly associated with a higher risk for and poorer outcomes from CVD events than optimistic styles. There are genetic and other bases for these life approaches, but behavioral, cognitive and meditative interventions can modify patients' level of pessimism, hopefully leading to better medical outcomes. Testing this theory would yield highly useful and practical data for clinical care."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Anxiety disorders are common, highly distressing, and impairing conditions. Effective treatments exist, but many patients do not access or respond to them. Mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are popular and can decrease anxiety, but it is unknown how they compare to standard first-line treatments.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether MBSR is noninferior to escitalopram, a commonly used first-line psychopharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial (Treatments for Anxiety: Meditation and Escitalopram [TAME]) included a noninferiority design with a prespecified noninferiority margin. Patients were recruited between June 2018 and February 2020. The outcome assessments were performed by blinded clinical interviewer at baseline, week 8 end point, and follow-up visits at 12 and 24 weeks. Of 430 individuals assessed for inclusion, 276 adults with a diagnosed anxiety disorder from 3 urban academic medical centers in the US were recruited for the trial, and 208 completed the trial.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were 1:1 randomized to 8 weeks of the weekly MBSR course or the antidepressant escitalopram, flexibly dosed from 10 to 20 mg.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was anxiety levels as assessed with the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale (CGI-S), with a predetermined noninferiority margin of -0.495 points.\nRESULTS: The primary noninferiority sample consisted of 208 patients (102 in MBSR and 106 in escitalopram), with a mean (SD) age of 33 (13) years; 156 participants (75%) were female; 32 participants (15%) were African American, 41 (20%) were Asian, 18 (9%) were Hispanic/Latino, 122 (59%) were White, and 13 (6%) were of another race or ethnicity (including Native American or Alaska Native, more than one race, or other, consolidated owing to low numbers). Baseline mean (SD) CGI-S score was 4.44 (0.79) for the MBSR group and 4.51 (0.78) for the escitalopram group in the per-protocol sample and 4.49 (0.77) vs 4.54 (0.83), respectively, in the randomized sample. At end point, the mean (SD) CGI-S score was reduced by 1.35 (1.06) for MBSR and 1.43 (1.17) for escitalopram. The difference between groups was -0.07 (0.16; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.23; P\u2009=\u2009.65), where the lower bound of the interval fell within the predefined noninferiority margin of -0.495, indicating noninferiority of MBSR compared with escitalopram. Secondary intent-to-treat analyses using imputed data also showed the noninferiority of MBSR compared with escitalopram based on the improvement in CGI-S score. Of patients who started treatment, 10 (8%) dropped out of the escitalopram group and none from the MBSR group due to adverse events. At least 1 study-related adverse event occurred for 110 participants randomized to escitalopram (78.6%) and 21 participants randomized to MBSR (15.4%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results from this randomized clinical trial comparing a standardized evidence-based mindfulness-based intervention with pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders found that MBSR was noninferior to escitalopram.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03522844."

            "abstract": "Latinx youth with mental health disorders have worse outcomes when compared to their White (non-Hispanic) counterparts. Latinx youth also have less access to and lower utilization of mental health services. Emerging research supports the psychological and physical benefits of engaging in yoga and yoga may function as a complimentary treatment option for patients with mental health challenges. However, research assessing the efficacy of yoga and mindfulness is particularly sparse among Latinx youth, who may particularly benefit from mind body awareness activities given barriers to more traditional health approaches. The objective of this quasi-experimental study was to examine the effects of a 12-week Vinyasa flow-based yoga group intervention on anxiety, depression, empathy, and life satisfaction among adolescents receiving outpatient mental health treatment. Adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a0186; 12-17\u00a0years old) were recruited to an active intervention condition (Yoga); a subsequent group of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a091) were recruited in the same manner to an assessment-only comparison control condition (Comparison). The Yoga group participated in culturally and developmentally tailored group yoga classes for 12\u00a0weeks. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the main effect intervention response between participants in the two conditions. At the post-intervention assessment, after controlling for baseline levels of outcome variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, empathy, and life satisfaction), on average participants in the yoga condition reported: less depression symptoms (B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), less anxiety symptoms (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), greater empathy (B\u00a0=\u00a01.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and greater life satisfaction (B\u00a0=\u00a00.30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) as compared to the Comparison condition.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify and map the evidence on nonpharmacological interventions for acute pain management in patients with opioid tolerance or opioid abuse.\nINTRODUCTION: Opioid therapy is the mainstay of pain management for adults experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain. However, considering the known risks of opioid use and the growing number of patients with opioid tolerance or opioid abuse, nonpharmacological pain management interventions are of increasing interest to health care providers. Nonpharmacological techniques have shown potential in reducing postoperative pain, opioid consumption, stress, and anxiety.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible studies included participants in either inpatient or outpatient health care settings who were experiencing acute pain and a tolerance to opioid medications or opioid abuse. Studies that examined nonpharmacological interventions for treating acute pain in these patients were considered. Nonpharmacological interventions included, but were not limited to, acupuncture, electroacupuncture, massage, mindfulness, electroanalgesia, low-level light therapy, meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and relaxation techniques.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the US National Library of Medicine ( https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ ) were searched, as were sources of unpublished studies on December 30, 2020. Only studies published in English were included, and there was no limit on date of publication. After screening the titles and abstracts of identified citations, 2 independent reviewers retrieved potentially relevant full-text studies and extracted data. Data are presented in diagrammatic format, and accompany the narrative synthesis.\nRESULTS: Fourteen articles were included in the study, including 10 expert opinion papers or chapters, 3 case reports, and 1 implementation report. The most common setting was the perioperative setting, specifically orthopedic surgery. Nonpharmacological pain interventions identified in the literature included physical interventions such as acupuncture, physical therapy, therapeutic exercise, yoga, bracing, heat, cold, elevation, compression, chiropractic interventions, massage, manual therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy. Behavioral and psychological modalities included positive affirmations, cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness, distraction, guided imagery, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation, hypnosis, breathing exercises, and energy healing. Many expert opinions included only brief mentions or recommendations for nonpharmacological interventions without full explanations, evidence from the literature, or discussion of the level of support for the recommendation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review indicate that nonpharmacological interventions for patients with opioid tolerance or dependence include physical, psychological, and multimodal approaches. Nonpharmacological interventions in this scoping review were often presented as combined with opioid or non-opioid medications for a pain management regimen that is opioid-sparing, opioid-free, or drug-free. More primary research is needed on the nonpharmacological acute pain management of patients with opioid dependence or opioid tolerance."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This review assesses interventions and their effectiveness in mitigating psychological consequences from pandemic.\nMETHOD: Published English literatures were searched from four databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO) from January 2020 and September 2021. A total of 27 papers with 29 studies (one paper reported three studies) met inclusion criteria. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool is applied to assess the quality of all randomised controlled trials (RCT).\nRESULTS: All studies were recently conducted in 2020. Publications were from high-income (13, 44.8%), upper middle-income (12, 41.4%) and lower middle-income countries (3, 10.3%) and global (1, 3.5%). Half of the studies conducted for general population (51.7%). One-third of studies (8, 27.6%) provided interventions to patients with COVID-19 and 20.7% to healthcare workers. Of the 29 studies, 14 (48.3%) were RCT. All RCTs were assessed for risk of biases; five studies (15, 35.7%) had low risk as measured against all six dimensions reflecting high-quality study.Of these 29 studies, 26 diagnostic or screening measures were applied; 8 (30.9%) for anxiety, 7 (26.9%) for depression, 5 (19.2%) for stress, 5 (19.2%) for insomnia and 1 (3.8%) for suicide. Measures used to assess the baseline and outcomes of interventions were standardised and widely applied by other studies with high level of reliability and validity. Of 11 RCT studies, 10 (90.9%) showed that anxiety interventions significantly lowered anxiety in intervention groups. Five of the six RCT studies (83.3%) had significantly reduced the level of depression. Most interventions for anxiety and stress were mindfulness and meditation based.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results from RCT studies (11%, 78.6%) were effective in mitigating psychological consequences from COVID-19 pandemic when applied to healthcare workers, patients with COVID-19 and general population. These effective interventions can be applied and scaled up in other country settings through adaptation of modes of delivery suitable to country resources, pandemic and health system context."

Limited data have been reported regarding the psychological status of these medical staff members. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the mental health status of medical staff and the efficacy of brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) in improving their mental health.\nMETHODS: A survey was conducted between April 18 and May 3, 2020. Upon completing the pre-test, participants in the treatment group received a 15-min BMM intervention every day at 8 p.m. Post-test questionnaires were completed after 16 days of therapy. The questionnaire comprised demographic data and psychological measurement scales. The levels of pre and post-test depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Athens Insomnia Scale, respectively.\nRESULTS: A total of 134 completed questionnaires were received. Of the medical staff, 6.7%, 1.5%, and 26.7% reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. Public officials from military hospitals reported experiencing greater pressure than private officials (t\u00a0=\u00a02.39, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018, d\u00a0=\u00a00.50). Additionally, BMM treatment appeared to effectively alleviate insomnia (t\u00a0=\u00a02.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027, d\u00a0=\u00a00.28).\nCONCLUSIONS: The medical staff suffered negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. BMM interventions are advantageous in supporting the mental health of medical staff."

The intervention consisted of 1-h weekly classes of mindfulness informed yoga. Acceptability was measured by uptake, attendance and participants' satisfaction. Safety was measured by incidence of physical injury, participants' level of comfort, distress and anxiety during the sessions, and the following mental health outcomes: positive and negative psychotic, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, sleep quality and functioning.\nRESULTS: Of those who consented to the study, 80% (12) participated and on average attended 4.4 yoga classes. There were no physical injuries and participants reported minimal distress and anxiety. Post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improvement in function.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based yoga interventions are both acceptable and safe as an intervention for youth with early psychosis. Though numbers were small, the study shows promise for yoga as a potentially useful intervention. Importantly, there was no deterioration in mental health outcomes. A larger trial evaluating clinical effectiveness is now timely."

            "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are thought to help patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) via distinct emotion-regulation mechanisms. However, no study has compared the effects of CBGT and MBSR on brain and negative emotion indicators of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance in patients with SAD.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of CBGT and MBSR on reappraisal and acceptance in patients with SAD and to test whether treatment-associated brain changes are associated with social anxiety symptoms 1 year posttreatment.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized clinical trial, a total of 108 unmedicated adults diagnosed with generalized SAD were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of CBGT, MBSR, or waitlist. The final sample included 31 patients receiving CBGT, 32 patients receiving MBSR, and 32 waitlist patients. Data were collected at the psychology department at Stanford University from September 2012 to December 2014. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to December 2020.\nINTERVENTIONS: CBGT and MBSR.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in self-reported negative emotion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal within an a priori-defined brain search region mask derived from a meta-analysis of cognitive reappraisal and attention regulation 1 year posttreatment.\nRESULTS: Of 108 participants, 60 (56%) were female. The mean (SD) age was 32.7 (8.0) years. Self-reported race and ethnicity data were collected to inform the generalizability of the study to the wider population and to satisfy the requirements of the National Institutes of Health. From the categories provided by the National Institutes of Health, 47 participants selected White (43.5%), 42 selected Asian (38.9%) 10 selected Latinx (9.3%), 1 selected Black (1%), 1 selected Native American (1%), and 7 selected more than 1 race (6.5%). CBGT and MBSR were associated with a significant decrease in negative emotion (partial \u03b72 range, 0.38 to 0.53) with no significant between-group differences when reacting (\u03b2, -0.04; SE, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.08; t92\u2009=\u2009-0.37; P\u2009=\u2009.71), reappraising (\u03b2, -0.15; SE, 0.09; 95% CI, -0.32 to 0.03; t92\u2009=\u2009-1.67; P\u2009=\u2009.10), or accepting (\u03b2, -0.05; SE, 0.08; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.11; t92\u2009=\u2009-0.59; P\u2009=\u2009.56). There was a significant increase in BOLD percentage signal change in cognitive and attention-regulation regions when reappraising (CBGT\u2009=\u20090.031; MBSR\u2009=\u20090.037) and accepting (CBGT\u2009=\u20090.012; MBSR\u2009=\u20090.077) negative self-beliefs. CBGT and MBSR did not differ in decreased negative emotion and increased reappraisal and acceptance BOLD responses. Reappraisal-associated MBSR (vs CBGT) negative emotions and CBGT (vs MBSR) brain responses were associated with social anxiety symptoms 1 year posttreatment.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that CBGT and MBSR may be effective treatments with long-term benefits for patients with SAD that recruit cognitive and attention-regulation brain networks. Despite contrasting models of therapeutic change, CBT and MBSR may both enhance reappraisal and acceptance emotion regulation strategies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02036658."

            "abstract": "Culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy (CA-CBT) is a well-evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees that uses psychoeducation, meditation, and stretching exercises. In the current study, we added problem-solving training to CA-CBT and evaluated this treatment (i.e., CA-CBT+) in a randomized controlled pilot trial with a sample of Farsi-speaking refugees. Participants (N = 24) were male refugees diagnosed with DSM-5 PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders who were randomly assigned to either a treatment or waitlist control (WLC) condition. Treatment components were adapted both to the specific cultural background and the current social problems of asylum seekers. Assessments were performed pretreatment, 12-weeks posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. The primary treatment outcome was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28); secondary outcome measures included the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life, and Emotion Regulation Scale. Eleven of 12 participants were randomized to CA-CBT+ completed treatment. Based on intent-to-treat data, large between-group effect sizes were seen at posttreatment in the GHQ-28, d = 3.0, and for most secondary outcome measures. Improvements for individuals in the treatment group decreased at 1-year follow-up, but effect sizes demonstrated continued large improvements on all measures as compared to pretreatment levels. In summary, CA-CBT+ led to large improvements in general psychopathological distress and quality of life, which were maintained in the long term. In addition, the dropout rate was very low, with delivery in group format. Thus, problem-solving training appears to be a promising addition to CA-CBT."

            "abstract": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2, capable of high human transmission. To protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization proposed intervening guidance that included movement restrictions, isolation, restriction of national and international travel or movement, and full or partial closure of organizations and institutions. Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24\u00a0h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation."

            "abstract": "Test anxiety has been a growing problem in school-aged children, especially for students in East-Asian countries where the pressure for academic achievement is high. These students are more vulnerable to academic stress, which could further lead to anxiety disorders. For this reason, this study examined the feasibility of virtual reality (VR) test anxiety program in managing anxiety in students. A total of 22 typically developing children with varying levels of test anxiety and no history of psychiatric illnesses participated in the study (mean age\u2009=\u200911.6 and standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u20091.84). A self-reported questionnaire measuring test anxiety, state-trait anxiety, and depression was administered. Heart rate (HR) variability and subjective anxiety were also measured to examine the changes during each of the anxiety-inducing (Exam 1 and Exam 2) and meditation (Med 1 and Med 2) sessions in the program. There was a significant difference in self-perceived anxiety during the program (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), as well as a significant main effect of time on the standard deviation of R-R interval (p\u2009=\u20090.002). In addition, a significant relationship between changes in HR and perceived anxiety during Exam 1 (p\u2009=\u20090.003), Med 1 (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), and Med 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.011) was found. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the feasibility of the virtual environment to induce different levels of anxiety and explores the potential use of VR program as a viable method to manage the negative emotion in students. This work shows the potential of technology-enhanced tools in addressing psychological problems in school-aged children.

            "abstract": "Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a detrimental noncommunicable disease, which is increasing due to sedentary lifestyle and urbanization in the young population. It is further elevated with risk factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, an increase in triglycerides, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and so on, which manifests as atherosclerotic disease. Yoga-based lifestyle intervention is a noninvasive effective treatment method to control and prevent cardiac risk factors in CAD patients. Yoga has been used in India as a therapeutic method to manage hypertension and other chronic disorders and is fast gaining popularity as an effective means for the alleviation of stress, improvement of fitness, and enhancement of well-being. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of introducing the integrated approach of yoga therapy (IAYT) in a cardiac rehabilitation center in India and understand its usefulness in improving the cardiac function and managing the cardiac risk factors in acute myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Methods and Design: Cardiac patients were randomized to a yoga-practicing group (n\u2009=\u200933) and a control group (n\u2009=\u200933). The yoga-practicing group was instructed to attend three supervised IAYT classes 3 days per week for 12 weeks at the hospital yoga center. The control group received standard care that included pharmacologic treatment and the instructions of the cardiologist. The outcome measures were assessed at baseline (T1\u2009=\u20090) and completion (T2\u2009=\u20093 months). The primary outcome measure was the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Results: There was no statistically significant difference in LVEF (U\u2009=\u2009420.500, p value\u2009=\u20090.218) between the two groups. However, the yoga-practicing group showed significant reduction in depression (Cardiac Depression Scale [CDS], U\u2009=\u200971, p value\u2009=\u20090.0), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], U\u2009=\u2009128, p value\u2009=\u20090.0), and a significant increase in quality of life (QOL) scores (Duke Activity Status Index [DASI], U\u2009=\u2009146, p value\u2009=\u20090.0; and metabolic equivalents (METs), U\u2009=\u2009136, p value\u2009=\u20090.0) at 3 months compared to control. Overall, the CAD patients practicing yoga showed a favorable profile compared to control individuals on CDS, HAM-A, DASI, and MET outcomes. Control and yoga practicing groups did not differ significantly in the lipid levels. Conclusion: This study indicated that the integration of yoga practice in a cardiac rehabilitation program is feasible and has no added benefit in improving the cardiac function. However, the addition of yoga to cardiac rehabilitation may be beneficial in reducing depression and anxiety and improving QOL in patients."

Insomnia can lead to increased inflammatory markers associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are more easily delivered within the community than cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) which was recommended as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, are effective in insomnia treatment and can reduce inflammatory markers level in older individuals with insomnia. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of an MBI to CBT-I in young and middle-aged individuals with insomnia disorder and explore its effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in inflammation.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This report describes a protocol for a randomised controlled trial. Seventy eligible participants will be assigned to mindfulness-based joyful sleep or CBT-I for 2-hour sessions weekly for 8 weeks. The primary outcome is sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, severity of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and sleep parameters recorded using sleep diary and polysomnography. Secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety and depression. The exploratory outcome is serum level of NF-\u03baB. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the ntervention period and at a 3\u2009month follow-up. Data will be analysed using general linear models, specifically analysis of covariance and analysis of variance will be used.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Full ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China (2018-S236). If Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep is proven effective, its dissemination will help bridge the gap between the unmet need and the demand for insomnia interventions in China.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03268629; Pre-results."

However, few reviews have synthesised the current evidence base regarding the effectiveness of these interventions and provided guidance to improve future intervention efforts.\nSTUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors conducted a systematic review to identify studies of any design reporting the effectiveness of any universal intervention to address these outcomes in medical students. Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from their respective start dates until 1 December 2017.\nFINDINGS: Data from 39 studies were included. Most investigated the effectiveness of relatively brief interventions designed to reduce stress; most commonly using mindfulness-based or guided meditation approaches. Only one implemented an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal ideation; none investigated the effectiveness of an intervention specifically designed to address suicidal behaviour. Five investigated the effects of curriculum-level changes. Overall, there was limited evidence of an effect for these programmes at both the postintervention and longest follow-up assessment on depression, anxiety and stress.\nCONCLUSIONS: Relatively brief, individually focused, mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in reducing levels of anxiety, depression and stress in medical students in the short term. Effects on suicidal ideation and behaviour, however, remain to be determined. There has been a significant lack of attention on organisational-level stressors associated with medical education and training."

There is some limited evidence that LY reduces depressive symptoms over the short term. However, the quality of previous LY studies is poor and none involved working-aged people with a clinical diagnosis of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility and potential efficacy of LY for improving residual mood, anxiety and stress symptoms in adults diagnosed with depression.\nMETHODS: Fifty participants were randomised to the group LY intervention (n\u202f=\u202f23) consisting of eight sessions over four weeks, or treatment-as-usual (n\u202f=\u202f27). Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and the Short Form 12 item Health Survey at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2). LY participants also completed a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ8) at T1 and eleven participated in individual qualitative interviews at T2.\nRESULTS: The LY group had statistically greater decreases in depression and improvements in mental health related quality of life compared to the control group from T0 to T1. The CSQ8 scores indicated a favourable level of satisfaction with the LY intervention. The qualitative interviews highlighted aspects of the intervention that were effective and those requiring modification.\nLIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size and treatment-as-usual control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: A full scale RCT of LY could be feasible if some modifications were made to the protocol/intervention. The intervention may be effective to improve depression and mental health related quality of life immediately post intervention."

Mind-body interventions such as Hatha Yoga and seated meditation have been used as a form of self-help therapy and it is especially useful for challenging occupations such as teachers and professors.\nAIMS: In this investigation, we aimed at observing the impact of Yoga Nidra and seated meditation on the anxiety and depression levels of college professors.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty college professors, men and women, aged between 30 and 55 years were randomly allocated in one of the three experimental groups: Yoga Nidra, seated meditation, and control group. Professors were evaluated two times throughout the 3-month study period. Psychological variables included anxiety, stress, and depression.\nRESULTS: Data analysis showed that the relaxation group presented better intragroup results in the anxiety levels. Meditation group presented better intragroup results only in the anxiety variable (physical component). Intergroup analysis showed that, except for the depression levels, both intervention groups presented better results than the control group in all other variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prepost results indicate that both interventions represent an effective therapeutic approach in reducing anxiety and stress levels. However, there was a tendency toward a greater effectiveness of the Yoga Nidra intervention regarding anxiety, which might represent an effective tool in reducing both cognitive and physiological symptoms of anxiety."

Studies were included if they had a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, included a non-active form of meditation and exercise as intervention arms, and evaluated physical or psychosocial outcomes. The quality of included RCTs was rated using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The total sample size across all studies was N\u00a0=\u00a0325. Of the main outcomes assessed across the five studies, meditation was shown to be more effective than the exercise comparison arm when evaluating the psychosocial outcomes of anxiety, altruism, and life changes. Additionally, meditation was more effective at reducing chronic neck pain at rest and pain-related bothersomeness. Exercise, however, was more effective in improving physical health-related quality of life, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose levels. The interventions were found to be comparable when evaluating the outcomes of well-being, ethanol consumption, and perceived stress levels. Four of the evaluated studies were determined to have an overall 'unclear' risk of bias and one study was found to have a 'high' risk of bias. Exercise and non-active meditation may uniquely influence various health-related outcomes. A continued exploration of the effects of exercise and non-active meditation in controlled trials may yield a better understanding of their benefits."

Fifty-one participants were recruited and randomized into the experimental and control groups, which underwent 4\u00a0days of Intensive Meditation (Templestay program, n\u00a0=\u00a033) and Relaxation (Control, n\u00a0=\u00a018), respectively. The self-report measures of Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised (CAMS) and the modified Korean version of the Resilience Quotient Test (RQT) were administered pre-, post- and 3\u00a0months after the intervention to measure participants' levels of mindfulness and resilience. Participants in both the Templestay program and Control groups showed significant increases in their scores on CAMS and RQT after completing the program. During the 3-month follow-up, a significant interaction effect of the intervention method and time was revealed for the\u00a0individuals' CAMS and RQT\u00a0scores. Our findings support the hypothesis that while relaxation practices may have certain stress reduction effects, the effects are predominantly mediated by the mindfulness meditation practice. Furthermore, the long-term benefits of increased resilience observed in the Templestay program group suggest that the practice may be a possible treatment strategy in clinical populations, such as patients with depression and anxiety."

            "abstract": "Arch et al. (2014) demonstrated that brief self-compassion meditation training (SCT) dampened sympathetic (salivary alpha-amylase) and subjective anxiety responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), relative to attention and no-instruction control conditions. The present study examined baseline predictors and moderators of these SCT intervention effects. Baseline characteristics included two stress vulnerability traits (social anxiety and rumination) and two potential resiliency traits (non-attachment and self-compassion). We investigated how these traits moderated the effects of SCT on response to the TSST, relative to the control conditions. We also tested how these individual differences predicted TSST responses across conditions in order to uncover characteristics that confer increased vulnerability and resiliency to social stressors. Trait non-attachment, rumination (for sympathetic TSST response only), and social anxiety (for subjective TSST response only) interacted with training condition to moderate TSST responses such that following SCT, lower attachment and lower social anxiety predicted lower TSST stress responses, relative to those scoring higher on these traits. In contrast, trait self-compassion neither moderated nor predicted responses to the TSST. Thus, although SCT had robust effects on buffering stress across individuals with varying levels of trait self-compassion, other psychological traits enhanced or dampened the effect of SCT on TSST responses. These findings support the importance of examining the role of relevant baseline psychological traits to predict sympathetic and subjective responses to social evaluative threat, particularly in the context of resiliency training."

            "title": "The effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospital settings: a systematic review of quantitative evidence protocol.",
            "abstract": "REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospitalized patient care settings.\nBACKGROUND: Nursing professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. Many of these stressors have always been inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses have been experiencing increased stress related to other factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically attention and memory, and this increases the already high stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very difficult situations that require accurate, timely decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are factors that create scenarios for risk of patient harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses: burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state that nurses experience considerable job stress which has been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this opinion and state that work related stress is largely contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report that work stress leads to a much higher turnover, especially during the first year after graduation, lowering retention rates in general.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43% of the nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11% of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital's staffing level increased burnout by 23%.Depression can be defined as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1% of the nurses' counterparts who do not work in healthcare. High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38%) and Taiwanese nurses (27.7%). In the Taiwanese study the occurrence of depression was significantly and positively correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses (p<0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression, Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80% more likely to have suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A further finding in this study revealed that 75% of the participants also suffered from at least one chronic disease revealing a strong association between depression and other major health issues.A stressful working environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses as \"non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences\". Nurse-to-nurse lateral violence leads to negative workplace relationships and disrupts team performance, creating an environment where poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence. According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI) developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI model has been widely used in occupational health settings based on its predictive power for adverse health and well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma & Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model, occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by Reineck & Furino indicated that registered nurses had a very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their profession but that they identified workplace relationships and stress issues as some of the most important contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge, Skogstad & Einarsen state that work-related stress further increases the potential for lateral violence as it creates a negative environment for both the target and the perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as \"paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment\". The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment awareness. The program has proven to be effective in reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from the general public, the reviewers reported a significant reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups were compared. However, there have been limited studies to date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based interventions can also enhance nurses' capacity for focused attention and concentration by increasing present moment awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in everyday situations as well as stressful situations. According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences people differently based on their viewpoint and their interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective on the connectivity of all things and not operate on automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the best research evidence available pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although CBT is efficacious for a wide variety of psychiatric conditions, relatively fewer GAD patients achieve high endstate functioning as compared to patients receiving CBTs for other disorders. Moreover, GAD trials that utilized patient samples without prominent depression have tended to report that effect sizes for depressive outcomes were small or diminished to pretreatment levels in the follow-up period. Emotion regulation therapy (ERT) integrates principles from traditional and contemporary cognitive behavioral treatments with basic and translational findings from affect science to offer a blueprint for improving intervention by focusing on motivational, regulatory, and contextual learning mechanisms.\nMETHOD: The purpose of this investigation was to provide initial support for the efficacy of ERT in an open trial of patients with GAD and cooccurring depressive symptoms. Twenty-one patients received a 20-session version of ERT delivered in weekly individual sessions. Standardized clinician ratings and self-report measures were assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment as well as at three- and nine-month follow-ups. Intent-to-treat analyzes were utilized.\nRESULTS: GAD patients, half with comorbid major depression, evidenced statistically, and clinically meaningful improvements in symptom severity, impairment, quality of life, and in model-related outcomes including emotional/motivational intensity, mindful attending/acceptance, decentering, and cognitive reappraisal. Patients maintained gains across the three and nine month follow-up periods.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings, although preliminary, provide additional evidence for the role of emotion dysregulation in the onset, maintenance, and now treatment of conditions such as GAD and cooccurring depressive symptoms."

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The literature data show that relaxation practice is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms. Different techniques such as progressive muscular relaxation, autogenic training, applied relaxation and meditation have been evaluated independently for anxiety disorders. The question is to know whether the combination of various techniques may be of interest in the transdiagnostic treatment of anxiety disorders.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: The present study assessed the short-term efficacy of a 10-week integrative and transdiagnostic relaxation program for anxiety disorders in outpatients of an anxiety disorders unit.\nMETHODS: The diagnoses were made according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998) and completed with an assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms using: the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y, -S and -T), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Four techniques were integrated into the structured 10-week protocol: breathing control, muscular relaxation, meditation and mental visualization.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (12 men and 16 women), mean age (S.D.)=38.82 years (11.57), were included in the study. All the included patients fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for a current diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (n=13) or Panic Disorder (n=15) with or without agoraphobia. At the end of the 10 sessions, we found a significant reduction in mean scores (S.D.) on the STAI-T from 53.179 (6.037) to 49.821 (8.028) (P<0.02), the BDI-II 20.964 (13.167) to 15.429 (11.341) (d=0.6543) and the QIPS 55.071 (10.677) to 49.679 (11.7) (d=0.5938). The observed reduction in the STAI-S (d=0.2776) was not significant.\nDISCUSSION: The results of this open study showed that this program significantly decreases the level of trait anxiety, depression and worry. The integrative and transdiagnostic relaxation program could represent an accessible and effective treatment to reduce anxious and depressive symptoms in various anxiety disorders. Future research should address the development of controlled trials assessing the impact of the different dimensions of anxiety and the long-term effects of this protocol."

We assessed the feasibility of Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy for Caregivers (CMIT-C), a novel 8-week group meditation and guided imagery group therapy program, for dementia caregivers reporting stress because of caregiving responsibilities.\nMETHODS: Twelve family dementia caregivers enrolled in CMIT-C. Primary outcomes included depression and anxiety, and secondary outcomes included insomnia, quality of life, and mindfulness. Changes over the study and 3\u2009month follow-up were analyzed with non-parametric related samples tests. Correlations of feeling state changes from meditation diaries at 1\u2009week were made with symptom changes post meditation training.\nRESULTS: Ten participants completed the study. Completers came to an average of 7\u2009\u00b1\u20091 sessions out of a possible 8 sessions, and turned in home practice logs of 90\u2009\u00b1\u200910% of the time. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms decreased, and mindfulness ratings improved with large effects (all p\u2009<\u20090.05 and Cohen's d\u2009\u2265\u20090.7). Gains were stable at 3\u2009months. Early response during the first week of meditation practice was associated with subsequent home meditation practice, anxiety change at 8\u2009weeks, and endpoint satisfaction with CMIT-C.\nCONCLUSIONS: Central Meditation and Imagery Therapy for Caregivers is a feasible intervention for dementia caregivers. Results suggest that this therapeutic technique can reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and increase levels of mindfulness. Early response to meditation practice predicted those with the greatest short-term benefits, and this may inform future studies of meditation. Larger controlled efficacy studies of CMIT-C for dementia caregivers are warranted."

In this study, we further investigated the effects of MBCT in bipolar disorder, in a controlled fMRI study.\nMETHOD: Twenty three patients with bipolar disorder underwent neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. Sixteen of these patients were tested before and after an eight-week MBCT intervention, and seven were wait listed for training and tested at the same intervals. The results were compared with 10 healthy controls.\nRESULTS: Prior to MBCT, bipolar patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and symptoms of stress, scored significantly lower on a test of working memory, and showed significant BOLD signal decrease in the medial PFC during a mindfulness task, compared to healthy controls. Following MBCT, there were significant improvements in the bipolar treatment group, in measures of mindfulness, anxiety and emotion regulation, and in tests of working memory, spatial memory and verbal fluency compared to the bipolar wait list group. BOLD signal increases were noted in the medial PFC and posterior parietal lobe, in a repeat mindfulness task. A region of interest analysis revealed strong correlation between signal changes in medial PFC and increases in mindfulness.\nLIMITATIONS: The small control group is a limitation in the study.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that MBCT improves mindfulness and emotion regulation and reduces anxiety in bipolar disorder, corresponding to increased activations in the medial PFC, a region associated with cognitive flexibility and previously proposed as a key area of pathophysiology in the disorder."

Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health.\nMETHODS: This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD.\nRESULTS: The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care."

Life's stressful events and daily stresses cause both deleterious and cumulative effects on the human body. The practice of meditation might offer a way to relieve that stress.\nOBJECTIVE: The research team intended to study the effects of meditation on stress-induced changes in physiological parameters, cognitive functions, intelligence, and emotional quotients.\nMETHODS: The research team conducted the study in two phases, with a month between them. Each participant served as his own control, and the first phase served as the control for the second phase. In phase 1, the research team studied the effects of a stressor (10 minutes playing a computer game) on participants' stress levels. In phase 2, the research team examined the effects of meditation on stress levels.\nSETTING: The research team conducted the study in a lab setting at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India.\nPARTICIPANTS: The participants were 34 healthy, male volunteers who were students.\nINTERVENTION: To study the effects of long-term meditation on stress levels, intelligence, emotional quotients, and cognitive functions participants meditated daily for 1 month, between phases 1 and 2. To study the immediate effects of meditation on stress levels, participants meditated for 15 minutes after playing a computer game to induce stress.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol and administered tests for the intelligence and emotional quotients (IQ and EQ), acute and perceived stress (AS and PS), and cognitive functions (ie, the Sternberg memory test [short-term memory] and the Stroop test [cognitive flexibility]). Using a pre-post study design, the team performed this testing (1) prior to the start of the study (baseline); (2) in phase 1, after induced stress; (3) in part 1 of phase 2, after 1 month of daily meditation, and (4) in part 2 of phase 2, after induced stress, both before and after 15 minutes of meditation.\nRESULTS: Induced stress from the computer game resulted in a significant increase in physiological markers of stress such as GSR and HR. In the short term, meditation was associated with a physiological relaxation response (significant decrease in GSR) and an improvement in scores on the Stroop test of reaction times. In the long-term, meditation brought significant improvements in IQ and scores for cognitive functions, whereas participants' stress levels (GSR and AS) decreased. EQ, salivary cortisol, and HR showed no significant changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The practice of meditation reduced psychological stress responses and improved cognitive functions, and the effects were pronounced with practice of meditation for a longer duration (1 month)."

This second study explores the effects of MBSR on basal sympathetic (SNS) activation among women with fibromyalgia.\nMETHODS: Participants (n = 24) responded to a television news appearance, newspaper, and radio advertisements. Effects on anxiety, depressive symptoms, and SNS activation measures were tested before and after MBSR using a within-subjects design.\nRESULTS: The MBSR treatment significantly reduced basal electrodermal (skin conductance level; SCL) activity (t = 3.298, p = .005) and SCL activity during meditation (t = 4.389, p = .001), consistent with reduced SNS activation.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this small sample, basal SNS activity was reduced following MBSR treatment. Future studies should assess how MBSR may help reduce negative psychological symptoms and attenuate SNS activation in fibromyalgia. Further clarification of psychological and physiological responses associated with fibromyalgia may lead to more beneficial treatment."

            "title": "Psychophysiological effects of breathing instructions for stress management.",
            "abstract": "Stressed and tense individuals often are recommended to change the way they breathe. However, psychophysiological effects of breathing instructions on respiration are rarely measured. We tested the immediate effects of short and simple breathing instructions in 13 people seeking treatment for panic disorder, 15 people complaining of daily tension, and 15 controls. Participants underwent a 3-hour laboratory session during which instructions to direct attention to breathing and anti-hyperventilation instructions to breathe more slowly, shallowly, or both were given. Respiratory, cardiac, and electrodermal measures were recorded. The anti-hyperventilation instructions failed to raise end-tidal pCO(2) above initial baseline levels for any of the groups because changes in respiratory rate were compensated for by changes in tidal volume and vice versa. Paying attention to breathing significantly reduced respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume instability compared to the other instructions. Shallow breathing made all groups more anxious than did other instructions. Heart rate and skin conductance were not differentially affected by instructions. We conclude that simple and short instructions to alter breathing do not change respiratory or autonomic measures in the direction of relaxation, except for attention to breathing, which increases respiratory stability. To understand the results of breathing instructions for stress and anxiety management, respiration needs to be monitored physiologically."

            "title": "Effect of yoga based lifestyle intervention on state and trait anxiety.",
            "abstract": "Considerable evidence exists for the place of mind body medicine in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Excessive anxiety is maladaptive. It is often considered to be the major component of unhealthy lifestyle that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of not only psychiatric but also many other systemic disorders. Among the approaches to reduce the level of anxiety has been the search for healthy lifestyles. The aim of the study was to study the short-term impact of a comprehensive but brief lifestyle intervention, based on yoga, on anxiety levels in normal and diseased subjects. The study was the result of operational research carried out in the Integral Health Clinic (IHC) at the Department of Physiology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The subjects had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, 'stress'), gastrointestinal problems (non ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcers, irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, chronic constipation) and thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). The intervention consisted of asanas, pranayama, relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, and lectures and films on philosophy of yoga, the place of yoga in daily life, meditation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness. The outcome measures were anxiety scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. Anxiety scores, both state and trait anxiety were significantly reduced. Among the diseased subjects significant improvement was seen in the anxiety levels of patients of hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, cervical spondylitis and those with psychiatric disorders. The observations suggest that a short educational programme for lifestyle modification and stress management leads to remarkable reduction in the anxiety scores within a period of 10 days."
